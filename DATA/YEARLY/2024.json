In 2012, the appellant subscribed for shares in two junior mining companies, in each case pursuant to a memorandum of understanding (MOU) entered into by the appellant or an affiliate. Each of the mining companies had a mining project it hoped to develop.\n[2] While each MOU contemplated that the appellant would be engaged to provide services in connection with the development and later operation of the relevant mine, each also contained several other terms relevant to the ongoing relationship between the junior mining company and the appellant and its affiliates.\n[3] Neither project proceeded and, in 2013, the appellant sold the shares of both companies to a related corporation at a loss. The appellant deducted the resulting losses in computing its income for the 2013 taxation year. The Minister reassessed the appellant on the basis that the losses were capital losses not deductible in computing income. The Tax Court of Canada dismissed the appeal of that reassessment (2022 TCC 71 per Boyle J.) and the appellant now appeals that decision to us.\n[4] The Tax Court\u2019s decision must be reviewed under the appellate standard of review established by Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33. This means questions of law are reviewed on a correctness standard and questions of fact or mixed fact and law are reviewable for palpable and overriding error.\n[5] The appellant submits that the Tax Court made three errors of law:\n1. Because the shares did not themselves produce income and the Tax Court found they were held and used in the appellant\u2019s business, the appellant says they are inventory, relying on Canada Safeway Limited v. Canada, 2008 FCA 24 (Canada Safeway).\n2. Because the shares were \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to, \u201ca necessary and integral part of\u201d, and \u201cacquired in the course of\u201d the appellant\u2019s services business, but not used in that business, the appellant says the loss was an income loss, citing Morguard Corporation v. The Queen, 2012 TCC 55, aff\u2019d 2012 FCA 306, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 35183 (25 April 2013) (Morguard Corporation), Glencore Canada Corporation v. The Queen, 2021 TCC 63 (Glencore Canada), and Johns-Manville Canada v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 46, 21 D.L.R. (4th) 210 (Johns-Manville).\n3. The Tax Court did not apply the test to determine whether the shares were acquired as an adventure in the nature of trade, and here the appellant had a secondary intention of selling the shares at a profit.\n[6] I cannot agree and therefore would dismiss the appeal.\n[7] Deciding whether a particular outlay or receipt is on income or capital account, or a particular property is capital property, is often difficult. In each case, that determination must be made with regard to the particular facts, having regard to various factors and all the surrounding circumstances: Canada Safeway at para. 61; Hillsdale Shopping Centre Ltd. v. The Queen, [1981] C.T.C. 322, 81 D.T.C. 5261 (FCA) at 327 (C.T.C.). It is necessarily a highly factually infused determination. Fact-finding is the purview of the Tax Court, not this Court on appeal.\n[8] Before the Tax Court, the parties submitted a partial agreed statement of facts and a joint book of documents. Only Mr. Yurkowski, the founder, president, and chief executive officer of the appellant, testified.\n[9] Over more than six pages of its reasons, the Tax Court summarized the evidence concerning the appellant and the share acquisitions. It found the shares \u201cwere acquired and held \u2026in connection with [the appellant\u2019s] business\u201d, \u201cwere not acquired for trading purposes\u201d, and \u201cconstituted an investment \u2026in the equity of the [mining companies]\u2026 intentionally [made]\u2026with a view to further strategically enhancing its future growth, and recoveries\/cash flow generated from its business.\u201d: Reasons at paras. 1, 10. It said \u201c[t]he evidence \u2026 overwhelmingly supports [those] findings\u201d: Reasons at para. 11.\n[10] I agree.\n[11] Although the appellant says the Tax Court erred in law, in effect it is asking us to review the evidence and make our own findings of fact, apply legal principles, and then come to our own conclusion. For example, the appellant says dividends were not expected to be paid on the shares, pointing to testimony from Mr. Yurkowski. Similarly, the appellant states that it contemplated the shares might increase in value in which case it might sell the shares, again pointing to Mr. Yurkowski\u2019s testimony.\n[12] Referencing a particular statement made by a witness does not permit this Court to make the factual findings the appellant desires, particularly where the Tax Court expresses concerns about the credibility of the testimony, as it did here. It expressly questioned the completeness of the \u201cdescription of the circumstances of the acquisition of the shares by the Appellant\u2019s [witness] in his testimony\u201d, requiring it \u201cto look beyond [the appellant\u2019s] own description of [its] intention, motivation, reason or purpose for having done something, and to effectively test that against the other objective evidence\u201d: Reasons at para. 11.\n[13] Here, neither the Tax Court nor the agreed statement of facts addressed the appellant\u2019s or the issuer\u2019s intentions concerning dividends on the shares following development of the mining project. Moreover, Mr. Yurkowski was equivocal regarding the appellant\u2019s plans for holding or disposing of the shares. During examination in chief, he described the appellant\u2019s goal as \u201cforming long-term joint ventures\u201d and the share acquisitions as \u201cthe first step to a long 20-, 30-year deal\u201d. The witness also testified that \u201c[w]hether or not we ever sold the shares was immaterial\u201d and when the appellant \u201cbought equity in a company [it] was to keep it as long as [it] possibly could\u201d.\n[14] Likewise, counsel and the courts must exercise care in considering the application of statements drawn from other cases. Read in light of the context in which they were made, statements that appear to mandate a particular characterization of an outlay or receipt, or acquisition or disposition, as being on income or capital account are not, in fact, unequivocal, but rather have a meaning that differs from that which the words on their face might suggest. Each case must be decided on the basis of its own facts and circumstances.\n[15] The appellant says that once the Tax Court found that a sale of the shares was inevitable, it must have viewed a future sale at a profit as a motivating factor in the acquisition, consistent with the testimony of its witness. Again, I disagree.\n[16] Although the Tax Court used the phrase \u201cinevitable sale\u201d at paragraph 10 of its reasons, the relevant sentence cannot be read in isolation. Read in the context of the statements that immediately precede it, and the Tax Court\u2019s reasons in their entirety, it cannot be seen as a finding that the appellant established an intention to sell the shares at a profit.\n[17] That the appellant may have \u201ccontemplated the possibility of resale of [the shares] is not, in itself, sufficient to conclude \u2026 the existence of an adventure in the nature of trade\u201d: Canada Safeway at paras. 61, 70. Rather, the prospect of resale must be an important consideration, or an operating motivation, for the acquisition: Canada Safeway at para. 61, see also paras. 46-59 where this Court discusses other relevant cases; Crystal Glass Canada Ltd. v. The Queen, [1989] 1 C.T.C. 330, 43 D.T.C. 5143 (FCA) at 330 (C.T.C.). As I have already explained, the evidence here supported more than one interpretation of the appellant\u2019s intention and I see no reason to interfere with the Tax Court\u2019s conclusions.\n[18] Contrary to the appellant\u2019s submission, the Tax Court did turn its mind to whether the shares could have been acquired as an adventure in the nature of trade. It quoted a passage from Canada Safeway addressing the distinction between inventory and capital property in that context: Reasons at para. 17. However, in neither its notice of appeal, nor its submissions to the Tax Court, did the appellant posit that the share acquisitions were adventures in the nature of trade. The Tax Court said not taking that position was consistent with the agreed statement of facts: Reasons at para. 21. In other words, the facts did not support finding an adventure in the nature of trade.\n[19] Finally, the appellant submits that Morguard Corporation, Glencore Canada, and Johns-Manville \u201cdemonstrate that losses incurred by disposing of property that is \u2018inextricably linked\u2019 to the ongoing operation of the business are on income account\u201d: appellant\u2019s memorandum of fact and law at para. 86. Had the Tax Court applied those cases, says the appellant, it \u201cwould have held that the Appellant acquired and disposed of the Shares in the course of an undertaking\u201d and that \u201cthe Losses were business losses\u201d: appellant\u2019s memorandum of fact and law at para. 106.\n[20] I cannot agree with the appellant\u2019s characterization of the three cases it cites, nor their relevance to this appeal. First, Morguard Corporation and Glencore Canada concern negotiated break fees received after a failed acquisition, not dispositions of property. Moreover, they were decided based on their particular facts and circumstances, as all of these cases must be.\n[21] As to Johns-Manville, the Tax Court considered it, but viewed it as inapplicable. I agree. It concerns property acquired for consumption in the business, the cost of which the Court there described as \u201cnot part of a plan for the assembly of assets\u201d: at 73. Here, the Tax Court found the shares were an investment made with a view to providing the appellant with long-term revenue and earnings, a finding amply supported by the evidence.\n[22] As I have noted, although the appellant asserts errors of law, it asks us to reweigh the evidence and substitute our views for those of the Tax Court. We cannot interfere with the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings, and findings of mixed fact and law, absent a palpable and overriding error.\n[23] I see no error that warrants our intervention and therefore I would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondent.\n\"K.A.

The two are identical, there being no confidential information disclosed in the confidential reasons.\nLOCKE J.A.\nI. Background [1] This is an appeal of a decision of the Federal Court (2022 FC 62, per Justice Michael D. Manson) in the context of an action brought pursuant to subsection 6(1) of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations, S.O.R.\/93-133 (the Regulations). In that action, the respondents, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. (collectively, Janssen), sought a declaration that the appellant, Pharmascience Inc. (Pharmascience), would infringe Canadian Patent No. 2,655,335 (the 335 Patent) if it were to make, use or sell its generic version of Janssen\u2019s patented medicine called INVEGA SUSTENNA.\n[2] INVEGA SUSTENNA involves a suspension of paliperidone palmitate for the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders. The 335 Patent teaches a regimen to achieve an optimum plasma concentration-time profile. It teaches a first loading dose administered in the deltoid muscle on day 1, a second loading dose administered in the deltoid muscle on day 8, and then monthly maintenance doses thereafter administered either in the deltoid or gluteal muscle. For non-renally impaired patients, the first and second loading doses are 150 and 100 mg equivalent (mg-eq.), respectively, and the monthly maintenance doses are 75 mg-eq. each. For renally impaired patients, the first and second loading doses are 100 and 75 mg-eq., respectively, and the monthly maintenance doses are 50 mg-eq. each.\n[3] Pharmascience brought a motion for summary trial or, alternatively, for dismissal of Janssen\u2019s action pursuant to section 6.08 of the Regulations, on the basis that its product would not infringe the 335 Patent since it would not provide the 75 mg-eq. dose, which is an essential element of all of the claims thereof. The Federal Court dismissed Pharmascience\u2019s motion. In the context of the summary trial, the Federal Court decided the infringement issue in favour of Janssen, finding that Pharmascience would induce infringement of the 335 Patent with its generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA. The action was allowed to proceed on the patent validity issues that had been raised by Pharmascience. That trial resulted in a decision (2022 FC 1218, 198 C.P.R. (4th) 329), which is the subject of an appeal before this Court (File No. A-205-22). That appeal has been heard and remains under reserve at the time these reasons for judgment have been released.\n[4] The legal test for a finding of inducing patent infringement was correctly stated by the Federal Court at paragraph 93 of its reasons:\nThere is a three \u201cprong\u201d test for inducement: (1) direct infringement by a third party; (2) the inducer influenced the third party to the point that the infringing act would not have occurred without the influence; and (3) the defendant knew that its influence would bring about the infringing act [Corlac Inc. v. Weatherford Canada Ltd., 2011 FCA 228 [Corlac]].\n[5] The Federal Court found that each of the prongs of the test was satisfied. In the present appeal, Pharmascience takes issue only with the first prong. Specifically, Pharmascience argues that the Federal Court erred in finding that direct infringement would result from use of its generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA, if the 75 mg-eq. dose were sourced from Janssen.\n[6] For the reasons set out below, I would dismiss this appeal.\nII. The Federal Court\u2019s Decision [7] The Federal Court addressed the first prong of the test for inducing infringement at paragraphs 95 to 120 of its reasons.\n[8] It first addressed Pharmascience\u2019s argument that any activities falling within the scope of the claims of the 335 Patent would be licensed for prescribing physicians and therefore not infringing (see paragraphs 96-102 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons). According to Pharmascience, this is because whenever a physician would prescribe or otherwise use Pharmascience\u2019s generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA, any such activities would require use of a 75 mg-eq. dose, which would be available only from Janssen. Pharmascience argued that, in the absence of limitations imposed by Janssen at the time of sale, a 75 mg-eq. dose that Janssen sells would include an implied license to use the 75 mg-eq. dose in any way the purchaser or prescribing physician chooses, including in the claimed dosing regimens with other doses obtained from an unlicensed source like Pharmascience.\n[9] The Federal Court considered some of the jurisprudence on the issue of the implied license and concluded that it did not apply to the 75 mg-eq. dose. It reasoned that the implied license relates to a patented article itself, and the 75 mg-eq. dose alone is not a patented article. It is merely one component thereof.\n[10] It is this portion of the Federal Court\u2019s analysis on the first prong of the test for inducing infringement that is the focus of Pharmascience\u2019s argument in this appeal.\n[11] The remainder of the Federal Court\u2019s analysis on the first prong concerned issues that are no longer in dispute. These included whether Pharmascience\u2019s product monograph contained instructions concerning the use of the 75 mg-eq. dose, and whether said product monograph would cause prescribers to change their practices regarding prescribing the 75 mg-eq. dose.\nIII. Standard of Review [12] The parties agree that the standard of review applicable in this case is as set out in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. Questions of law are reviewed on a standard of correctness, and questions of fact or of mixed fact and law from which no question of law is extricable are reviewed on a standard of palpable and overriding error. A palpable error is one that is obvious. An overriding error is one that goes to the very core of the outcome of the case. When arguing palpable and overriding error, it is not enough to pull at leaves and branches and leave the tree standing. The entire tree must fall: Canada v. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 FCA 165, [2012] F.C.J. No. 669 at para. 46 (cited with approval in Benhaim v. St-Germain, 2016 SCC 48, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 352 at para. 38).\nIV. Analysis [13] Central to Pharmascience\u2019s argument that the Federal Court erred in failing to recognize the extent of the implied license in this case is the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Eli Lilly & Co. v. Novopharm Ltd., [1998] 2 S.C.R. 129, 161 DLR (4th) 1 (Eli Lilly). That case involved a compulsory licence that was granted to Novopharm to manufacture and import bulk nizatidine. Novopharm entered into a supply agreement with Apotex whereby the former would provide the latter with nizatidine to be formulated into capsules. The dispute concerned whether the licensed nizatidine that Apotex acquired from Novopharm included an implied licence to manufacture capsules from the bulk nizatidine.\n[14] In addressing this point, the Supreme Court of Canada at paragraph 99 adopted the following text from the Federal Court of Appeal decision in that case:\nIf a patentee makes a patented article, he has, in addition to his monopoly, the ownership of that article. And the ownership of a thing involves, as everybody knows, \u201cthe right to possess and use the thing, the right to its produce and accession, and the right to destroy, encumber or alienate it\u201d.... If the patentee sells the patented article that he made, he transfers the ownership of that article to the purchaser. This means that, henceforth, the patentee no longer has any right with respect to the article which now belongs to the purchaser who, as the new owner, has the exclusive right to possess, use, enjoy, destroy or alienate it. It follows that, by selling the patented article that he made, the patentee impliedly renounces, with respect to that article, to [sic] his exclusive right under the patent of using and selling the invention. After the sale, therefore, the purchaser may do what he likes with the patented article without fear of infringing his vendor\u2019s patent.\nThe same principles obviously apply when a patented article is sold by a licensee who, under his licence, is authorized to sell without restrictions. It follows that, if Apotex were to purchase bulk Nizatidine manufactured or imported by Novopharm under its licence, Apotex could, without infringing Lilly\u2019s patents, make capsules from that substance or use it in any other possible way. [SCC\u2019s emphasis.]\n[15] The Supreme Court of Canada went on as follows:\n100 Perhaps the principles underlying this well-founded statement of the law merit some brief elaboration at this stage. As I have already noted in connection with the distinction between a sublicence and an ordinary agreement of purchase and sale of a patented or licensed article, the sale of a patented article is presumed to give the purchaser the right \u201cto use or sell or deal with the goods as the purchaser pleases\u201d: see Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik v. Isler, [[1906] 1 Ch. 605], at p. 610. Unless otherwise stipulated in the licence to sell a patented article, the licensee is thus able to pass to purchasers the right to use or resell the article without fear of infringing the patent. Further, any limitation imposed upon a licensee which is intended to affect the rights of subsequent purchasers must be clearly and unambiguously expressed; restrictive conditions imposed by a patentee on a purchaser or licensee do not run with the goods unless they are brought to the attention of the purchaser at the time of their acquisition: see National Phonograph Co. of Australia, Ltd. v. Menck, [1911] A.C. 336 (P.C.).\n101 Therefore, it is clear that, in the absence of express conditions to the contrary, a purchaser of a licensed article is entitled to deal with the article as he sees fit, so long as such dealings do not infringe the rights conferred by the patent. On this score, Eli Lilly alleges that the reformulation of nizatidine would in this case exceed the scope of the rights obtained by the purchaser because it would constitute not simply the resale of the material purchased, but rather, the creation of a new article in violation of Eli Lilly\u2019s patent. However, I can find no basis, either in the evidence or in the case law cited by Eli Lilly, for this submission. In my view, the reformulation of nizatidine into final-dosage form does not have the effect of creating a new article. Rather, it is more akin to repackaging the substance into a commercially usable form, which I do not view as violating any rights under the patents.\n[16] So it is clear that the sale of a patented article without restriction includes the right to use that article as the purchaser pleases. This much is not in dispute. This principle is well supported by prior jurisprudence: Thomas v. Hunt (1864), 17 C.B.N.S. 183, 144 E.R. 74 at 76; Betts v. Willmott (1871), L.R. 6 Ch. App. 239, 19 W.R. 369 at 245; Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik v. Isler (1906), 1 Ch. 605, 75 L.J. Ch. 411 at 610, aff\u2019d [1906] 2 Ch. 443, 23 R.P.C. 633 (C.A.); Hatton v. Copeland-Chatterson Co. (1906), 37 S.C.R. 651 at 653; Gillette v. Rea, [1910] O.J. No. 587, 15 O.W.R. 345 at para. 2; National Phonograph Company of Australia Ld. v. Menck, [1911] A.C. 336, 28 R.P.C. 229 at 234, 238, 246, 248 (U.K.P.C.); Signalisation de Montr\u00e9al Inc. v. Services de B\u00e9ton Universels Lt\u00e9e, [1993] 1 F.C. 341, [1992] F.C.J. No. 1151 at paras. 17, 20 (C.A.). The principle is also supported by jurisprudence subsequent to Eli Lilly: Apotex Inc. v. Merck & Co., 2002 FCA 210, [2002] F.C.J. No. 811 at para. 39; Distrimedic Inc. v. Dispill Inc., 2013 FC 1043, [2013] F.C.J. No. 1093 at para. 226 (Distrimedic); Angelcare Canada Inc. v. Munchkin, Inc., 2022 FC 507, [2022] F.C.J. No. 480 at para. 276 (Angelcare).\n[17] Janssen argues that this principle does not apply in this case. It notes that the article it would sell in the scenario before this Court (the 75 mg-eq. dose) is not itself a patented article, but merely a component of a patented invention that includes several different doses. Janssen argues that the jurisprudence concerning implied license is limited to the patented article itself, and therefore the purchase from Janssen of only the 75 mg-eq. dose would not carry with it an implied license to combine that dose with other doses obtained from Pharmascience to practise the patent invention.\n[18] Pharmascience disputes the distinction based on whether the article sold is the whole patented article or merely one component. It refers to Slater Steel Industries Ltd. v. R. Payer Co. Ltd., (1968) 55 C.P.R. 61, 38 Fox Pat. C. 139 (Ex. Ct.) (Slater Steel), which concerned a patent on a helically shaped rod wound around an electric power transmission line. The claims concerned the combination of the rod and the transmission line. The Exchequer Court noted that the patentee and its Canadian licensee in that case \u201cmake use of the patents, not by manufacturing the combination that is the subject of the patents, but by manufacturing the preformed armour rods and selling them to power companies who use the rods to create such combination by applying them to their transmission lines.\u201d The Court went on to observe that, \u201c[n]o licence has been granted under the patents to any person in Canada to create the combination covered by the patents except the implied licence flowing from the sale of the preformed armour rods\u201d (see page 65).\n[19] The Exchequer Court concluded that the defendant, who supplied a competing rod, had not infringed because it had not directly infringed by making the patented combination, and had not induced its customer to do so. Nevertheless, Pharmascience urges this Court to conclude from the words at the end of the sentence quoted at the end of the previous paragraph (\u201cexcept the implied licence flowing from the sale of the preformed armour rods\u201d) that the sale of one component of a patented combination includes an implicit license to use the combination.\n[20] I am not prepared to draw such a general conclusion from this statement by the Exchequer Court more than 50 years ago in obiter dicta. In my view, the context of the transaction is relevant. In the context of Slater Steel, it appears to have been implicit that the purchaser from the patentee of a pre-formed rod as described in the patent in suit was entitled to use that rod on the patented combination. It does not appear that the purchaser was expected also to source its transmission lines from the patentee. Any implied license would be restricted to making the combination with rods made or sold by the patentee. In the absence of any pleading or evidence otherwise, the Court declined to find that an implied license existed. The Exchequer Court discussed this issue at page 86 of the decision.\n[21] However, the same does not necessarily apply in the present case. There appears to be no reason to conclude that either Janssen or its customers (a prescribing physician or a patient) would have understood that the purchase of paliperidone palmitate in a single dose from Janssen would include an implied licence to use the entire dosing regimen of the product in combination with other doses obtained from unlicensed sources, to practise the invention of the 335 Patent. It is difficult to accept that there could be such an implied licence in circumstances where neither the supposed licensor nor the supposed licensee would have understood such a licence to exist.\n[22] Pharmascience also cites the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Distrimedic. In the relevant portion of that case, Distrimedic was accused of inducing infringement of patent claims to a pill-sorting device and a device for opening a set of pill containers with a knife. There was no evidence that Distrimedic had sold any such device, but Distrimedic had sold pill containers to pharmacists who had obtained such devices from the patentee. It appears that the allegation was that those pharmacists used the patentee\u2019s devices with Distrimedic\u2019s pill containers, and were induced to do so by Distrimedic. Among the reasons cited by the Federal Court for dismissing this argument was that the patentee \u201cmust be presumed to have acquired an implicit right to use [the devices] without restriction\u201d (see paragraph 226 of its reasons).\n[23] In my view, this decision can be of little assistance to Pharmascience because the pill-sorting device and device for opening a set of pill containers were the subject of distinct claims that were not interdependent. Hence, the purchase of these items from the patentee was the purchase of the patented article, and not a mere component thereof. This decision does not support the principle that sale of a mere component of a patented invention includes an implied license to use the patented invention without restriction, as Pharmascience urges.\n[24] For its part, Janssen relies on this Court\u2019s decision in MacLennan v. Produits Gilbert Inc., 2008 FCA 35, [2008] F.C.J. No. 128 (MacLennan). The patent in that case concerned a system for replacing damaged or used saw teeth on tooth holders used in circular saws for feller heads in the forestry industry. The idea was to minimize losses by facilitating tooth replacement. The appellants sold the combination of the teeth and tooth holders. They alleged inducing patent infringement by the respondent, which manufactured and sold replica replacement teeth to be used by the appellants\u2019 customers with tooth holders purchased from the appellants.\n[25] The appellants were successful in establishing that the respondent induced patent infringement by its sale of the replica teeth. Janssen notes that the fact that the customers had purchased one component of the patented combination (the tooth holders) from the appellants did not avoid a finding that they had directly infringed the patent. Clearly, the Court in MacLennan found no implied licence for the purchasers of the appellants\u2019 tooth holders to use them with other components of the patented combination that had been obtained from unlicensed sources. Janssen argues that the facts in MacLennan are on all fours with those in the present appeal.\n[26] Pharmascience seeks to distinguish MacLennan on the basis that the debate there concerned the extent of the implied right of a purchaser to repair. The respondent there had argued that the teeth required replacement because of ordinary use, and the purchaser had an implied license to repair its tooth holders by replacing the damaged or used teeth. This Court disagreed. It found that the focus of the patented invention in that case was the easy replacement of teeth, and therefore their replacement was not repair but remaking of the invention (see MacLennan at paragraph 23). Pharmascience argues that the present appeal is distinguishable from MacLennan in that it concerns the right to use an invention rather than the right to remake it.\n[27] I do not agree with the distinction that Pharmascience urges. On my reading, this Court in MacLennan refused to deal with an implied licence to repair because of the nature of the invention there. Nothing in that conclusion contemplates a broad implied licence to use a patented article. In fact, the finding of inducement there indicates that purchasers of tooth holders from the patentee did not obtain an unlimited right to use them in the patented combination.\n[28] Further support for the approach described in MacLennan is found in the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Angelcare. That case involved a patent on a combination of a pail for storing soiled diapers and a cartridge of plastic film for use in the pail. Among other things, the defendants were accused of inducing infringement by selling cartridges for use in the appellants\u2019 pail. One of the defences was that purchasers of the plaintiffs\u2019 pails had obtained an implied licence to use them as they please, including with cartridges purchased from the defendants. The argument was that, with such an implied licence, there could be no act of direct infringement upon which to base an allegation of inducement. The Federal Court addressed MacLennan at paragraphs 278 to 280 of its reasons in Angelcare. It found no basis to distinguish MacLennan and concluded that there was inducement to infringe.\n[29] In both of these cases, the patented invention constituted a combination invention and therefore, the sale of a mere component of it was insufficient to grant the implied right to use the entire combination. To grant an implied licence, the sale of the entire combination had to occur, or at least, as in Slater Steel, the parties\u2019 intended use of the component at the time of sale contemplated its use in the patented combination.\n[30] In summary, I am not convinced that the Federal Court erred in any way in its finding that users of Janssen\u2019s 75 mg-eq. dose with Pharmascience\u2019s doses in other amounts would directly infringe the 335 Patent and hence that the first prong of the test for inducing patent infringement would be met.\n[31] Pharmascience argues, in the alternative, that the Federal Court erred in not limiting its findings of inducing infringement to claims 17 to 32 of the 335 Patent, which concern the use of a dosage form according to the claimed dosing regimens. The other claims of the 335 Patent concern prefilled syringes adapted for administration according to the claimed dosing regimens (claims 1 to 16), the use of paliperidone as paliperidone palmitate in the manufacture\/preparation of a medicament adapted for administration according to the claimed dosing regimens (claims 33 to 48), and a dosage form adapted for administration according to the claimed dosage regimens (claims 49 to 63).\n[32] I am not convinced that the Federal Court erred in this respect either. Just as with claims 17 to 32, all of the other claims of the 335 Patent would be directly infringed by a physician or a patient using Pharmascience\u2019s generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA with 75 mg-eq. doses sourced from Janssen. Moreover, just as with claims 17 to 32, all such direct infringement would be induced by Pharmascience.\nV. Conclusion [33] It follows from the foregoing that I would dismiss the present appeal. I would award costs to Janssen in the agreed amount of $10,000, all-inclusive.\n\"George R.

The Minister of National Revenue (October 6, 2022), 2022\u2013379 (CPP) (TCC) (per St Hilaire J.) granting the respondent\u2019s motion to quash the appellant\u2019s appeal to the Tax Court under the Canada Pension Plan, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-8 (CPP), and dismissing the appeal.\n[2] Essentially, the appellant is seeking a transfer of contributions made to the Irish Single Public Service Pension Scheme in the course of his employment with University College Dublin for the period of November 1, 2019 to August 31, 2020, to the Canada Pension Plan.\n[3] The standard of review on this appeal is correctness for a question of law, and palpable and overriding error for a question of fact or mixed fact and law, where there is no extricable question of law: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. An error is palpable when it is plainly seen, and overriding when it affects the result: Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Canada, 2021 FCA 10, 456 D.L.R. (4th) 722 at para. 55.\n[4] We see no error that warrants our intervention. Section 26.1 of the CPP allows a request to be made to a CRA officer to rule on certain questions, including whether an employment is pensionable. A person concerned by the ruling may appeal it to the Minister under section 27. A person affected by a decision of the Minister under section 27 may, under section 28, appeal that decision to the Tax Court, which may vacate, confirm or vary the decision. It was open to the Tax Court, on the evidentiary record before it, to determine that there was no decision of the Minister under section 27, particularly given the appellant\u2019s acknowledgement of this fact at the hearing before the Tax Court.\n[5] The Tax Court of Canada is a statutory court. It derives its jurisdiction from statutory sources, such as the CPP. In this respect, the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Chaput v. Romain, 1955 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1955] S.C.R. 834, is of no assistance to the appellant.\n[6] Considering, without deciding, the appellant\u2019s argument that the Minister\u2019s alleged inaction regarding his request for a transfer of his contributions to the Irish Single Public Service Pension Scheme to the Canada Pension Plan provides him with a cause of action against the Minister, the Tax Court did not err in deciding that, in the absence of a section 27 decision, it had no jurisdiction under section 28 of the CPP to hear the appellant\u2019s appeal. This appeal will therefore be dismissed, with costs.\n\u201cGerald Heckman\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-225-22\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMIDJOHODO FRANCK GLOGLO v.

Canada (Environment and Climate Change), 2023 FC 1511 (per Furlanetto J.). They seek a stay until 60 days following the disposition of their appeal from the Federal Court\u2019s judgment. In the judgment in question, the Federal Court quashed and declared retroactively invalid and unlawful as of April 23, 2021 the Order Adding a Toxic Substance to Schedule 1 to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, registered on April 23, 2021, and published on May 12, 2021, in the Canada Gazette Part II, Vol. 155, Number 10 (the Order).\n[2] The Order added plastic manufactured items (PMI) to the List of Toxic Substances in Schedule 1 to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, S.C. 1999, c. 33 (CEPA).\n[3] Section 90 of CEPA (as it read on April 23, 2021) delegates to the Governor in Council the authority to add substances to Schedule 1 to CEPA. It provided:\nAddition to List of Toxic Substances\nInscription sur la liste des substances toxiques\n\u25cf 90 (1) Subject to subsection (3), the Governor in Council may, if satisfied that a substance is toxic, on the recommendation of the Ministers, make an order adding the substance to the List of Toxic Substances in Schedule 1.\n\u25cf 90 (1) S\u2019il est convaincu qu\u2019une substance est toxique, le gouverneur en conseil peut prendre, sur recommandation des ministres, un d\u00e9cret d\u2019inscription de la substance sur la liste de l\u2019annexe 1.\n\u25cf Priority\n\u25cf Priorit\u00e9\n(1.1) In developing proposed regulations or instruments respecting preventive or control actions in relation to substances specified on the List of Toxic Substances in Schedule 1, the Ministers shall give priority to pollution prevention actions.\n(1.1) Lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00e9tablir des projets de textes \u2014 r\u00e8glements ou autres \u2014 portant sur les mesures de pr\u00e9vention ou de contr\u00f4le relatives \u00e0 des substances inscrites sur la liste de l\u2019annexe 1, les ministres donnent priorit\u00e9 aux mesures de pr\u00e9vention de la pollution.\n\u25cf Deletion from List\n\u25cf Radiation de la liste\n(2) Subject to subsection (3), the Governor in Council may, if satisfied that the inclusion of a substance specified on the List of Toxic Substances in Schedule 1 is no longer necessary, on the recommendation of the Ministers, make an order\n(2) S\u2019il est convaincu qu\u2019une substance n\u2019a plus \u00e0 figurer sur la liste de l\u2019annexe 1, le gouverneur en conseil peut, sur recommandation des ministres et par d\u00e9cret :\n\u25cb (a) deleting the substance from the List and deleting the type of regulations specified in the List as being applicable with respect to the substance; and\n\u25cb a) radier de la liste la substance et la mention du type de r\u00e8glements aff\u00e9rents;\n\u25cb (b) repealing the regulations made under section 93 with respect to the substance.\n\u25cb b) abroger les r\u00e8glements pris en application de l\u2019article 93.\n\u25cf Order subject to conditions\n\u25cf R\u00e9serve\n(3) Where a board of review is established under section 333 in relation to a substance, no order may be made under subsection (1) or (2) in relation to the substance until the board\u2019s report is received by the Ministers.\n(3) La prise des d\u00e9crets vis\u00e9s aux paragraphes (1) ou (2) est toutefois subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception par les ministres du rapport de la commission de r\u00e9vision \u00e9ventuellement constitu\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 333.\n[4] By virtue of this provision, substances may be added to the list in Schedule 1 to CEPA if the Governor in Council is satisfied that they are toxic.\n[5] In the judgment under appeal, the Federal Court held that the Order was both unreasonable and unconstitutional because the Governor in Council \u201ccould not have been satisfied\u201d that all PMIs are toxic (at paras. 116 and 184).\n[6] It is common ground between the parties that the Order enabled the promulgation of a subsequent regulation, the Single-use Plastics Prohibition Regulations, SOR\/2022-138 (the Single-use Regulations).\n[7] As of the date of these Reasons, several provisions in the Single-use Regulations have come into force. These provisions prohibit, in the circumstances detailed in them, the manufacture and import for sale in Canada of a number of single-use plastic items. These include certain types of: single-use plastic ring carriers, single-use plastic straws, plastic checkout bags, single-use plastic cutlery, single-use plastic foodservice ware, and single-use plastic stir sticks. In addition, the Single-use Regulations prohibit the sale in Canada as of December 20, 2023 of certain: plastic checkout bags, single-use plastic cutlery, single-use plastic foodservice ware, single-use plastic stir sticks, and single-use plastic straws.\n[8] The Regulatory Impact Statement (RIAS) that accompanied the Single-use Regulations explains that the prohibited items are the most prevalent items contributing to plastic pollution and that it is estimated that the Single-use Regulations will result in a net decrease of approximately 1.3 million tonnes of plastic waste in Canada over 10 years. This represents approximately 3% of the plastic waste in the country and 5% of the total plastic pollution in Canada.\n[9] It is clear from the materials filed by the appellants, which include the mandate letters issued to two successive Ministers of the Environment and Climate Change, that banning the use of harmful single-use plastics and taking steps toward eliminating plastic pollution in Canada were and are important objectives of the federal government.\n[10] Based on the evidence filed by the appellants in support of their stay motion, it appears that Environment and Climate Change Canada has spent over $1.5 million in the 2022-2023 fiscal year and had planned spending of over $3.3 million in the 2023-2024 fiscal year to implement the Single-use Regulations. Activities undertaken include meeting with businesses and industry associations, publishing news releases, conducting social media campaigns, completing design work for compliance materials, conducting campaigns with regulatees, developing and delivering training to enforcement officers, and responding to enforcement referrals.\n[11] According to the same evidence, as of December 8, 2023 (the date the appellants\u2019 supporting affidavit was sworn), many businesses have switched to alternatives to the single-use plastics that then were or would be prohibited by the Single-use Regulations. It is to be anticipated that many more businesses have made or are in the process of making the switch as several prohibitions came into force on December 20, 2023 or will come into force on June 20, 2024.\n[12] The Single-use Regulations are being challenged in an application that is currently pending before the Federal Court in Court File T-1468-22. While the parties to that application have agreed that it should be stayed, pending the disposition of this appeal, the Federal Court has not issued a stay order. Moreover, as the appellants note in their submissions, another party could commence a similar application in the Federal Court at any point.\n[13] With this background in mind, I turn now to more specifically address the appellants\u2019 stay application.\n[14] The test for the grant of a stay in a case like this is well-known and requires the moving party to establish that: (1) their appeal raises a serious issue; (2) they would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; and (3) the balance of convenience favours granting the stay: RJR-Macdonald Inc v. Canada (Attorney General), 1994 CanLII 117 (SCC), [1994] 1 SCR 311 at 334 (RJR-MacDonald); Canada v. Canadian Council for Refugees, 2008 FCA 40 at para. 18 (Canadian Council for Refugees).\n[15] The threshold for establishing the first criterion of a serious issue is generally a low one. It will be met in a case like the present if the issues raised in the Notice of Appeal are not frivolous: RJR-Macdonald at 348; Canadian Council for Refugees at paras. 18, 22.\n[16] Here, I am satisfied that the Notice of Appeal raises many such issues. This is especially so when one recalls that the applicable standard of review will require this Court to effectively step into the shoes of the Federal Court, to re-conduct the reasonableness analysis, and to decide if it erred in law in its constitutional analysis. Thus, the first criterion for the issuance of the requested stay is met.\n[17] I am also of the view that the second and third criteria are met in this case.\n[18] The case law recognizes that, where the grant or refusal of a stay would suspend legislation, regulations or other promulgations, the public interest is engaged and is considered as part of both the second and third criteria for the issuance of a stay: RJR MacDonald at 348; Canadian Council for Refugees at para. 24.\n[19] The public interest, moreover, is to be widely-construed. As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada at page 346 of RJR MacDonald, in the context of a request to stay the effect of legislation that was alleged to violate the Charter:\n\u2026 the concept of inconvenience should be widely construed in Charter cases. In the case of a public authority, the onus of demonstrating irreparable harm to the public interest is less than that of a private applicant. This is partly a function of the nature of the public authority and partly a function of the action sought to be enjoined. The test will nearly always be satisfied simply upon proof that the authority is charged with the duty of promoting or protecting the public interest and upon some indication that the impugned legislation, regulation, or activity was undertaken pursuant to that responsibility. Once these minimal requirements have been met, the court should in most cases assume that irreparable harm to the public interest would result from the restraint of that action.\nA court should not, as a general rule, attempt to ascertain whether actual harm would result from the restraint sought. To do so would in effect require judicial inquiry into whether the government is governing well, since it implies the possibility that the government action does not have the effect of promoting the public interest and that the restraint of the action would therefore not harm the public interest.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[20] Contrary to what the respondents assert, these principles have been applied to stay cases outside the Charter context. For example, the Quebec Court of Appeal, in a division of powers case, refused a stay where the effect of granting it would have been to suspend legislation in Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2013 QCCA 1263 at para. 50.\n[21] Here, the appellants have established that the promulgation of the Order and enactment of the subsequent Single-use Regulations were undertaken pursuant to the federal government\u2019s responsibility to act in the public interest as that concept has been defined by the case law.\n[22] Moreover, the linkage between the Order and the Single-use Regulations is evident. While the appellants do not concede that the Federal Court\u2019s judgment means that the Single-use Regulations are invalid, they nonetheless recognize that the Order enabled the enactment of the Single-use Regulations.\n[23] Such enablement is evident. Subsection 93(1) of CEPA ties the Governor in Council\u2019s delegated authority to promulgate regulations under CEPA to substances having been listed in Schedule 1 of CEPA. At the relevant time, subsection 93(1) of CEPA provided:\nRegulations\nR\u00e8glements\n\u25cf 93(1) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the Governor in Council may, on the recommendation of the Ministers, make regulations with respect to a substance specified on the List of Toxic Substances in Schedule 1, including regulations providing for, or imposing requirements respecting,\n\u25cf 93(1) Sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (3) et (4), le gouverneur en conseil peut, sur recommandation des ministres, prendre des r\u00e8glements concernant une substance inscrite sur la liste de

the Federal Court on the effect of subsequent legislation that added PMIs to Schedule 1 of CEPA and that this motion consequently should be dismissed.\n[25] Subsequent to the passage of the Single-use Regulations, Parliament adopted legislation that also itself added PMIs to Schedule 1 of CEPA, namely, the Strengthening Environmental Protection for a Healthier Canada Act, S.C. 2023, c. 12 (Bill S-5). The respondents argue that, in seeking the present stay, the appellants take a position that is inconsistent with their assertion before the Federal Court that Bill S-5 rendered the application to strike the Order moot. They say that, for this reason among others, this stay motion should be refused.\n[26] With respect, I disagree. In its Reasons for Judgment issued in this matter, the Federal Court held at paragraph 32 that the adoption of Bill S-5 did not render the respondents\u2019 motion to strike the Order moot because:\n\u2026the logical inference from the transposition of the complete List of Toxic Substances from Schedule 1 under CEPA to Schedule 1 enacted by Bill S-5 is that PMI would not be listed on the new Schedule 1 if it were not listed on [the original] Schedule 1 of the List of Toxic Substances.\n[27] I express no opinion on whether the Federal Court erred in this regard. What is certain, though, is that its decision has cast doubt on the validity of the Single-use Regulations and the effect of Bill S-5 on the validity of those regulations, which may well cause considerable confusion in the country.\n[28] Given the number of parties impacted by the Single-use Regulations, the recent coming into force of many of the prohibitions in them, and the case law that favours the grant of a stay pending appeal in circumstances where legislation, regulations, or other promulgation would be rendered inoperative, I find that the second and third steps of the test for the grant of a stay are met in this case. In short, if the stay were refused, irreparable harm would be done to the orderly roll-out of the Single-use Regulations and considerable confusion would arise for the many businesses that have moved to comply with their provisions. This would not be in the public interest, which has been found by binding case law to exist when there is some indication that the impugned legislation, regulation, or activity was undertaken by a body charged with acting in the public interest. The Governor in Council, who promulgated the Order, is the highest federal executive authority and is charged with so acting.\n[29] Thus, a stay will be granted. However, it will not be for the full duration requested by the appellants.\n[30] The appellants have requested that the stay should run until 60 days following the disposition of their appeal from the Federal Court\u2019s judgment. I believe it is appropriate that this interim stay should instead extend only to the date of such disposition. If the appellants wish a longer stay, they should make a request for it in their memorandum of fact and law and oral argument. It is a matter for the panel hearing the appeal to decide if the stay should be extended past the date on which this Court renders judgment on the appellants\u2019 appeal. I note, parenthetically, that no extension of this stay would be required if the appellants are successful in their appeal.\n[31] The respondents have requested that, if the stay is granted, the appeal be expedited. I agree that this is appropriate.\n[32] The parties shall forthwith confer to see if they can agree to a timeline for the completion of the steps required to perfect this appeal, with a view to its being heard by no later than June 7, 2024. They shall submit to the Court their agreed schedule or, failing agreement, their respective proposed timelines within 7 days. The matter shall thereafter be returned forthwith to the undersigned to make the required order to set the schedule.\n\"Mary J.L.

Deeproot Green Infrastructure, LLC, 2023 FCA 184 (the Judgment), to change the disposition to allow the appeal as opposed to dismissing it.\n[2] For the reasons that follow, this motion will be dismissed, with costs.\n[3] The appellant says that this Court failed to deal with its arguments on overbreadth in its Reasons for Judgment. It claims that, had these arguments been addressed, the appeal would have been allowed due to the lack of an upper limit to the term \u201cat least approximately 85%\u201d soil volume in Claim 1 in Canadian Patents 2,552,348 and 2,829,599 (collectively, the Patents). In its view, this lack of an upper limit renders the claims invalid for overbreadth since they include 100% soil volume, which is impossible.\n[4] There is no merit to the appellant\u2019s assertions in this regard. There are also several reasons why this motion should be dismissed.\n[5] First, the appellant\u2019s motion was brought well outside the applicable ten-day time limit provided in Rule 397(1) of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106 (Federal Courts Rules).\n[6] Although Rule 8 of the Federal Courts Rules allows the Court to extend the time limits provided in the Rules, such an extension is not appropriate here. The case law establishes that extensions may be granted in circumstances where the party seeking the extension shows that granting it is in the interests of justice. The relevant circumstances to establish this include whether: (1) the party had a continuing intention to pursue the matter, which commenced before the relevant time limit expired; (2) there is a reasonable explanation for the delay; (3) there is some merit to the party\u2019s application; and (4) there is no prejudice to the opposite party: Rafique v. Canada (National Revenue) 2023 FCA 112, 2023 A.C.W.S. 2239 at paras. 2-3; Canada (Attorney General) v. Larkman, 2012 FCA 204, [2012] 4 C.N.L.R. 87 at paras. 61 and 62; Canada (Attorney General) v. Hennelly, [1999] F.C.J. No. 846, 224 N.R. 399 at para. 3.\n[7] Here, the appellant says that it delayed in bringing its motion to vary the Judgment because the matter was complex and it wanted to settle the issue before seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. Neither assertion holds weight.\n[8] There is no evidence that the appellant formed an intention to bring this motion within the relevant ten-day time limit or, indeed, at any time before it prepared the motion materials. Thus, it fails to meet the first criterion for the requested extension. While this is a sufficient basis for dismissing this motion, we briefly set out additional reasons why it should be dismissed.\n[9] The appellant also does not meet the second criterion for the extension of time because its explanation for the delay in bringing this motion is not reasonable. The appellant was represented by experienced counsel, who should have easily been able to grasp within the required ten days whether an issue was unaddressed by the Court, had this been the case. Moreover, there is no rational connection between the deadline for seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and the deadline to bring a Rule 397 motion.\n[10] Likewise, the third criterion for the extension is absent because there is no merit to the appellant\u2019s claims.\n[11] The Court did deal with the appellant\u2019s overbreadth arguments that the claims were broader than the invention made, as the appellant eventually conceded in paragraphs 4 to 6 of its reply submissions on this motion. These were the bulk \u2013 if not the totality \u2013 of the appellant\u2019s submissions on the point to this Court.\n[12] The appellant now says that, in addition to asserting that the claims were broader than the invention made (which raises a factual issue), it also alleged that the claims were overbroad because they disclose an error of construction (and thus a question of law).\n[13] This argument is without merit as, reading the Patents with a mind willing to understand, as the Court must do, an upper limit sufficient to allow for the structure of the cell must be understood to be part of Claim 1 in the two Patents. As the respondents rightly note, a patent is not invalid merely because it leaves open to the skilled person to avoid known unsuitable choices: Burton Parsons Chemicals, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard (Canada) Ltd. (1974), [1976] 1 S.C.R. 555 at 565-566, 54 D.L.R. (3d) 711 at 717-718; AFD Petroleum Ltd. v. Frac Shack Inc., 2018 FCA 140, 295 A.C.W.S.

Overview\n[1] Jessie Waldron, a survivor class member under the Indian Day Schools Settlement Agreement (IDSSA), appeals from an order of the supervising judge (McLean v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FC 987, Phelan J.). In his order, the supervising judge dismissed Ms. Waldron\u2019s motion to require the claims administrator under the IDSSA to consider the further documentation of abuse she submitted following the filing of her original claim for compensation, and to increase the level of compensation to which she is entitled. Her motion also sought a declaration recognizing a similar entitlement on the part of other members of the survivor class.\n[2] The supervising judge determined that the individual relief Ms. Waldron claimed was not available under the IDSSA, and that she was seeking in effect to have the Court amend the agreement\u2014something it had no jurisdiction to do. He also held that Ms. Waldron, as a class member and not a representative plaintiff, had no entitlement to seek relief on behalf of the class.\n[3] I sympathize with Ms. Waldron\u2019s position. However, for the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.\nII. Background A. The IDSSA [4] The underlying action was certified as a class action in 2018, on consent. As certified, the action alleged among other things that in its operation of Indian day schools, Canada breached fiduciary, constitutional, statutory, and common law obligations owed to survivors of the school system, and that it infringed their Aboriginal rights.\n[5] Settlement negotiations took place over 17 days during the period August to December 2018. The parties reached a settlement in principle in November 2018 and a settlement in March 2019. The settlement was documented in the IDSSA. Recital G to the IDSSA states:\nThe parties intend there to be a fair, comprehensive and lasting settlement of claims related to Indian Day Schools, and further desire the promotion of healing, education, commemoration, and reconciliation. They have negotiated this Settlement Agreement with these objectives in mind.\n[6] Among the benefits the IDSSA provides is individual compensation to Indian day school survivors. Further details concerning the compensation payable and the claims process are set out below beginning at paragraph 15.\n[7] In addition to a claims process for survivor class members, the IDSSA provides for the establishment of a $200 million legacy fund, which the parties agreed would support legacy projects contributing to truth, healing, and reconciliation. The IDSSA states that it is intended that both survivor class members and family class members (spouses, former spouses, children, grandchildren, and siblings of survivor class members) benefit from these projects.\n[8] The IDSSA contains (in section 1.12) a release in favour of Canada. It also contains an \u201centire agreement\u201d clause (in section 1.13), and states (in section 14.02) that except as expressly provided, no amendment may be made to the agreement unless agreed to by the parties\u2014that is, the representative plaintiffs and the Attorney General\u2014in writing and approved by the Federal Court.\n[9] In August 2019, after a three-day settlement approval hearing in May 2019 (about which more will be said later in these reasons), the supervising judge approved the IDSSA, including the claims process and a draft claim form. In giving his approval, he described the IDSSA (McLean v. Canada, 2019 FC 1075 at para. 1) as \u201cthe culmination of litigation concerning tragic, scarring events in the lives of those who attended Indian Day Schools. These events include mockery, belittlement, and physical, sexual, cultural and emotional abuse, which are soul damaging.\u201d He recognized that \u201c[h]ealing will be a long-term process at best.\u201d\n[10] The settlement approval order described the settlement as \u201cfair, reasonable and in the best interests of the Plaintiffs and the Class Members\u201d (McLean v. Canada, 2019 FC 1074 at para. 2). In his reasons for granting the settlement approval order (2019 FC 1075 at para. 145), the supervising judge similarly concluded that the settlement agreement was \u201cfair and reasonable and in the best interests of the Class as a whole.\u201d\n[11] The approval order expressly incorporated the IDSSA, and required that it be implemented in accordance with the approval order and further orders of the Court (2019 FC 1074 at para. 3). The order addressed the further role of the Court in the following terms (2019 FC 1074 at para. 9):\nThis Court, without in any way affecting the finality of this Order, reserves exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over this action, the Plaintiffs, all Class Members who have not opted out of the Settlement Agreement, and the Defendant for the limited purposes of implementing the Settlement Agreement and enforcing and administering the Settlement Agreement and this Order.\n[12] No appeal was brought from the approval order by any party entitled to appeal.\n[13] A class member did bring a motion to this Court under rule 334.31(2) of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.98\/106, for leave to exercise the right of appeal of the representative plaintiffs. The motion was heard by Rivoalen J.A. (as she then was) and dismissed: Ottawa v. McLean, 2019 FCA 309.\n[14] In dismissing the motion, she agreed (at paras. 19-21) with the statement of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Bancroft\u2011Snell v. Visa Canada Corporation, 2019 ONCA 822 at para. 22, leave to appeal refused, 2020 CanLII 23634 (SCC) and 2020 CanLII 23637 (SCC), that \u201c[t]here are sound policy reasons why class members should not be entitled to appeal a settlement order where the representative plaintiff declines to do so.\u201d She was also (at para. 22) \u201cnot satisfied that the appeal itself [was] in the best interests of the Class.\u201d\nB. Compensation payable to survivor class members [15] Under the IDSSA, compensation is available to survivor class members who experienced harm associated with attending an Indian day school during the class period (which runs from January 1, 1920 to the date of closure or transfer from Canada of the particular school). The amount of compensation to which a claimant is entitled is based on a grid, or levels of harm, established following an analysis of damage awards in analogous cases.\n[16] There are five levels on the grid, from the lowest, level 1, to the highest, level 5. The higher the level, the more serious is the sexual or physical abuse and resulting harm required to establish a claim, and the greater is the amount of compensation payable if the claim is established\u2014from $10,000 for a level 1 claim to $50,000, $100,000, $150,000, and $200,000 respectively for claims at levels 2, 3, 4, and 5.\nC. The claims process [17] In his reasons for granting settlement approval, the supervising judge described the claims process under the IDSSA (2019 FC 1075 at para. 43) as \u201cbased on a simple claim form on which claimants self identify a single level of compensation.\u201d\n[18] The IDSSA called for the process to be administered by a claims administrator appointed by the Federal Court on the recommendation of the parties. The settlement approval order appointed Deloitte as claims administrator. The order described the claims administrator\u2019s role as follows (2019 FC 1074 at para. 11):\nSubject to the Court\u2019s ongoing supervision and orders, the Claims Administrator will develop, install and implement systems, forms, information, guidelines and procedures for processing and making decisions on Claim Applications in accordance with the Settlement Agreement and will develop, install and implement systems and procedures for making payments of compensation in accordance with the Settlement Agreement.\n[19] Section 9.03 of the IDSSA is entitled \u201cPrinciples Governing Claims Administration\u201d. The principles it enumerates include the following.\nThe Claims Process is intended to be expeditious, cost-effective, user-friendly and culturally sensitive.\nThe intent is to minimize the burden on the Claimants in pursuing their Claims and to mitigate any likelihood of re-traumatization through the Claims Process.\nThe Claims Administrator [\u2026] shall, in the absence of reasonable grounds to the contrary, assume that a Claimant is acting honestly and in good faith.\nIn considering an Application, the Claims Administrator [\u2026] shall draw all reasonable and favourable inferences that can be drawn in favour of the Claimant, as well as resolving any doubt as to whether a Claim has been established in favour of the Claimant.\n[20] According to the partner of Deloitte who manages its engagement as claims administrator, Deloitte designed the claims process on the basis that claimants would submit one claim form for processing and adjudication, and that \u201cprogressive disclosure\u201d\u2014the ability for claimants at the intake stage to change their self-identified level of harm or add narrative or further documents to their claim form once submitted\u2014was not to be part of the process.\n[21] Sections 9 and 10 of the IDSSA, together with Schedule B, set out further particulars of the claims process and the role of the claims administrator. The IDSSA provides two and a half years for Class Members to file their claims. It also provides for both emotional and legal support to class members in the claims process through the office of the claims administrator, class counsel (whose services are free to class members), or counsel of the class member\u2019s choosing.\n[22] The claims administrator\u2019s determination of whether a claimant is entitled to compensation, and if so at what level, is to be based on the information provided in the claim form, the final version of which was also approved by the supervising judge. A decision of the claims administrator is final and binding on the claimant without any recourse or appeal, except as set out in the claims process.\n[23] The claim form sets out descriptions of harm corresponding to each of the five levels. Claimants are to describe their experience at an Indian day school by reference to these descriptions and self-identify the level of compensation they are claiming, corresponding to the most serious harm they claim to have suffered. Claimants are also to provide supporting documentation, the nature of which depends on the level of compensation claimed. Claimants may, in the alternative, submit a declaration that they do not have access to the required documentation.\n[24] According to the approved claims process, the claims administrator, after reviewing a claim form, is to send one of three acknowledgment letters to the claimant: a letter confirming the claimant\u2019s eligibility as a class member; a letter denying the claimant\u2019s eligibility as a class member; or a letter requesting additional information (such as a missing signature or copy of a document) to determine the claimant\u2019s eligibility as a class member.\n[25] As noted above, level 1 is the lowest level of claim. To meet the requirements for a level 1 claim, the claimant need only allege verbal abuse or physical abuse, \u201cincluding but not limited to culturally unreasonable or disproportionate acts of discipline or punishment.\u201d The claim form instructs claimants to select level 1, and place a mark in the corresponding box, if that description \u201crepresents the most serious abuse\/harm that [the claimant] experienced.\u201d It states that if the claimant selects level 1, \u201cno further description is required.\u201d\n[26] Canada is to pay $1.27 billion (and up to $1.4 billion if required) to fund the payment of level 1 claims, and has no right to be informed of or object to claims at that level.\n[27] As the self-identified level of claim increases from level 2 to level 5, claimants must disclose increasingly more serious physical and\/or sexual abuse to establish their claims. These claims can be supported by disclosing physical or mental impairment over time that is linked to abuse.\n[28] The claim form instructs claimants to identify the abuse or harm they suffered by reference to the descriptions of level 2 to 5 abuse or harm set out in the grid. They are then instructed to \u201cSelect [their] Claim Level, by placing a mark in one box below, for the Level of abuse\/harm [they] suffered as identified above [on the form].\u201d Beside four boxes, one for each level from 2 to 5 and the corresponding compensation level, the form then states, \u201cPlace a MARK in ONE box\u201d (emphasis in original). The claim form contains no provision for making multiple claims or for changing the level of a claim once selected.\n[29] Canada has the right to provide the claims administrator with supplemental information regarding eligibility for compensation at levels 2 to 5. It is to transfer funds directly to the claims administrator as necessary to provide for payment of claims at these levels.\n[30] If the claims administrator determines that a claim meets or exceeds the criteria for a class member\u2019s selected level, payment is processed at the level assessed by the claims administrator. If the claims administrator is of the view that the claim does not meet the criteria for the self-identified level, it must notify the class member and provide brief reasons for this conclusion. The class member then has the right to have the claim reconsidered, and may submit a response to the claim administrator\u2019s reasons and provide additional information.\n[31] If, despite the response and the additional information provided, the claims administrator remains of the view that the class member is eligible for compensation only at a level below the self-identified level, the class member has a right of review by a third party assessor. The third party assessor may invite the class member to provide more information, including by means of a video recording of the class member\u2019s evidence.\n[32] The claims process expressly contemplates in only two circumstances the possibility that survivor class members may submit additional documentation in support of their filed claims: (1) in response to an acknowledgment letter from the claims administrator requesting missing information (such as a signature or a copy of personal identification) or (2) in the course of reconsideration or third party review of a claim made at one of levels 2 to 5. According to the claims administrator, it would also consider missing information submitted by a claimant where the claimant identified the omission to provide missing information before the claims administrator requested it. Beyond these limited circumstances, there is nothing in the claims process that could be considered provision for progressive disclosure.\nD. Implementation of the claims process [33] The supervising judge approved the amended claim form on January 7, 2020. Implementation of the claims process began shortly afterwards, on January 13, 2020. The claims deadline, which was specified as two years and six months after settlement implementation, was therefore July 13, 2022. As of May 2021, the claims administrator had received 111,642 claims from an estimated class of 140,000, and had adjudicated and paid some 72,000 claims. Some 90% of the paid claims were at level 1.\n[34] The claims administrator proceeded on the basis that under the court-approved claims process, progressive disclosure was not permitted. However, two sets of difficulties arose in the early stages of implementing the claims process.\n[35] First, the claims administrator observed that claimants were submitting multiple claim forms through different methods of delivery, with additional narratives, additional support documents, and altered claim levels. In the first 78 days of the claims period, from January 13, 2020 to March 31, 2020, the claims administrator received 40% more written submissions than claims\u201441,171 submissions related to 29,199 claims. This required the claims administrator to spend significant time on measures to ensure there were no duplicate claims or double payments.\n[36] In early February 2020, the claims administrator advised the parties of this situation. Following consultation with the parties, the claims administrator provided what it described as a \u201ctemporary allowance or exception\u201d, by which claimants would be permitted to increase the level of their claim as long as the claim had not yet been adjudicated or paid.\n[37] Second, the COVID-19 pandemic created further complications. Because government offices were ordered to be closed, claimants had difficulties in obtaining supporting documents. In addition, employees of the claims administrator could not attend at their offices to process claims, and the claims administrator could not determine the date that claim forms were received. Where claimants had submitted multiple claims, the claims administrator could not determine which version was the first. The temporary allowance also addressed these issues.\n[38] Court approval was not sought for the temporary allowance.\n[39] On May 27, 2020, after further consultation and agreement with the parties, the claims administrator informed the parties that the temporary allowance would end. It set June 15, 2020 as the last day for claimants either to submit additional information or to declare they would be doing so. Public notice of the date was disseminated via Facebook, the Federal Indian Day School Class Action website, and the claims administrator\u2019s website.\nE. Ms. Waldron\u2019s claims [40] Ms. Waldron is a survivor of an Indian day school, the Waterhen Indian Day School in Saskatchewan. She gave evidence that once she learned of the IDSSA, she attempted to obtain information about the process of making a claim, and help in doing so and in disclosing the abuse that she experienced. She stated that she did not think she was just a level 1 claimant, but wanted to be sure.\n[41] However, she stated, her efforts to obtain information and assistance were largely unsuccessful. She therefore filed a level 1 claim, in June 2020. She deposed that she \u201cwas so fed up and just wanted to get it over with,\u201d and that she filed a claim at level 1 \u201cout of confusion and frustration.\u201d\n[42] In September 2020, a law firm representing Ms. Waldron filed another claim on her behalf, outlining abuses at levels 3 and 4. Later that month, the claims administrator advised that it would not accept the new claim form or the new claim level selections.\n[43] In declining to accept Ms. Waldron\u2019s second claim, the claims administrator stated that \u201cthe Claims Process is designed for Claimants to submit their Claim form only once\u201d and that the \u201cJune 15th deadline [on the availability of the temporary allowance] was instituted in line with the Duties of the Claims Administrator ([under section]10.01) to develop, install and implement systems, guidelines and procedures for processing and making decisions on Applications.\u201d\n[44] The claims administrator accordingly accepted Ms. Waldron\u2019s claim only at level 1, and not at level 3 or level 4. She received and cashed a cheque for the $10,000 level 1 amount.\nF. The motions in the Federal Court [45] Ms. Waldron and another similarly situated survivor class member (who has not pursued an appeal to this Court) brought motions in the Federal Court, which were heard together by the supervising judge. They sought orders allowing them to change their claims to level 4 and instructing the claims administrator to consider the further information they had submitted to support their higher claim levels. They also sought a declaration that the IDSSA permits class members to submit further documentation and\/or modify their claim level selection prior to receiving a decision on their claims.\n[46] Before the supervising judge, the moving parties explained that they were frustrated, were panicked, or sought to end quickly the process of filing a claim. As a result, they initially submitted level 1 claims they knew did not reflect the most severe harm they experienced at their day school. They sought to file new, higher level claims at a later date, which they contended the IDSSA permitted them to do.\nG. Potential consequences of granting the motions [47] The claims administrator, which was granted leave to intervene, submitted evidence of the practical and administrative difficulties that would result from granting the motions.\n[48] According to the claims administrator, implementing progressive disclosure would likely result in the suspension of the claims adjudication process until all information for each claim was known. In addition, the claims administrator would have to check the many contacts it received from claimants daily by phone, email, and mail for additional information before adjudicating and paying claims. Level changes from level 1 to higher levels would further delay adjudication to take into account any information provided by Canada.\nH. Dismissal of the motions [49] The supervising judge dismissed the motions (McLean v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FC 987, Phelan J.). He held (at paragraph 49) that while the Federal Court has continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over the implementation of the IDSSA, it is severely limited in its review of the settlement agreement and its administration. It is not, he stated, the role of the Court to impose additional terms that it considers appropriate or to rewrite the agreement. In coming to this conclusion, he relied on statements in J.W. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 20 at paras. 34, 120, in stating that courts may intervene in class action settlements only in very limited circumstances, where relevant negotiated terms of the settlement are not applied or where there is a gap in the settlement agreement.\n[50] Here, the supervising judge reasoned (at paragraph 52), the relief the moving parties were seeking would essentially insert into the IDSSA a term permitting progressive disclosure, or the filing of multiple claims at different compensation levels. However, he stated, the IDSSA does not provide for progressive disclosure or multiple claims, so that to grant the individual relief sought would be inconsistent with the IDSSA and the intent of the parties. Accordingly, he concluded that he could not grant that relief.\n[51] The supervising judge also determined (at paragraphs 55-56) that the moving parties had no authority to seek a declaration on behalf of the class, and thus to supplement the court-approved responsibilities and obligations of the representative plaintiffs and class counsel. He noted that the moving parties had not sought leave under rule 334.31 of the Federal Courts Rules (referred to above at paragraph 13).\n[52] The supervising judge then considered (beginning at paragraph 57) the moving parties\u2019 submission that on a proper reading, the IDSSA provides for progressive disclosure as part of the intake phase of the claims process. In interpreting the IDSSA, he stated, he had considered the text, the context, and the stated or manifested intention of the parties.\n[53] Looking first to the text (at paragraph 59), he found nothing in the IDSSA suggesting that progressive disclosure or the right to file modified claims was a feature of the agreement. He noted that the IDSSA\u2019s use of the singular \u201cclaim\u201d was consistent with the position that it permitted a claimant to file only one claim. He also pointed to the reference in the IDSSA to filing the claim form with \u201call supporting documents\u201d, which he found indicative of finality to the filing of a claim.\n[54] Looking to context (at paragraph 65), the supervising judge observed that \u201ca key factor in the structure of the IDSSA was to avoid many of the problems associated with the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement [IRSSA], including the [Independent Assessment Process (IAP)] and its progressive disclosure feature.\u201d Under the IRSSA, a precursor to the IDSSA entered into in 2006, survivors of residential schools (as opposed to survivors of day schools with entitlements under the IDSSA) could seek compensation through the specially designed IAP. As the Supreme Court observed in Canada (Attorney General) v. Fontaine, 2017 SCC 47 at paras. 2-9, this entailed disclosure by claimants at an in-person hearing of \u201cacutely sensitive particulars\u2014both of the abuse suffered, and of its consequences\u2014for examination by an adjudicator.\u201d\n[55] The supervising judge noted (at paragraph 67) that at the settlement approval hearing, there was considerable evidence and submissions regarding the differences between the IRSSA process and the process then proposed for the IDSSA. Among the concerns expressed about the process under the IDSSA was that it could take time for class members to feel able to disclose the sexual abuse to which they had been subjected. Given the requirement to document claims at levels higher than level 1, class members could as a consequence end up claiming and taking level 1 benefits when they should be entitled to more: appeal book at 882-883, 911, 973-974. (This was in fact the position of Ms. Waldron, according to her evidence on this motion.) The supervising judge stated (at paragraph 69) that he was aware of the desire of some class members to have a process more like that of the IRSSA. On the other hand, he stated, there was also evidence that the simpler, paper-based, non-confrontational approach proposed for the IDSSA would be preferable to the \u201cextremely adversarial, confrontational and difficult\u201d process adopted in the IAP, and would, among other things avoid re-traumatization: appeal book at 1257-1258, 1299.\n[56] As a result, the supervising judge stated (at paragraph 69), he had been aware in approving the settlement of the concerns regarding the lack of provision for progressive disclosure, but nonetheless had found the settlement to be reasonable. He found that although the term \u201cprogressive disclosure\u201d was not used at the settlement approval hearing, in light of what had transpired there he understood that the IDSSA claims process \u201cwas not meant to follow such a feature.\u201d It would, he stated, be \u201cinconsistent to now import or interpret the IDSSA Claims Process in a manner giving effect to that aspect of the IRSSA. It would not be a fair and reasonable interpretation given this context.\u201d\n[57] The supervising judge further found (at paragraph 77), based on the parties\u2019 actions and submissions, that the intention of the parties did not support progressive disclosure as a binding concept in the IDSSA. He described it as \u201ccompelling\u201d, given the contractual nature of the IDSSA, that neither party to the agreement supported the moving parties\u2019 position.\n[58] The supervising judge went on to note (at paragraph 78) that the claims adjudicator, in accordance with its duties and responsibilities, had set up the claims process in conjunction with the parties, in a manner reflective of their understanding of the IDSSA. After reviewing the intake and assessment phases of the IDSSA claims process, he concluded that the intention of the parties was that \u201ca Claimant was to file for a single harm level with all the relevant documentation,\u201d and that the parties\u2019 actions were consistent with that intention.\n[59] The supervising judge stated (at paragraph 85) that he accepted the evidence of the claims administrator as to the practical and administrative difficulties that would result from \u201cunscrambling the egg\u201d, and adopting the moving parties\u2019 view as to the proper interpretation and application of the IDSSA. While these difficulties could not alone justify the position of the parties to the settlement agreement on the intention underlying claims process and their understanding of its terms, they helped to demonstrate that under the claims process, \u201ca single claim was to be filed and dealt with.\u201d\n[60] The supervising judge then addressed the submission that what the claims administrator did in permitting a form of progressive disclosure until June 15, 2020 reflected the proper interpretation and application of the IDSSA. He described this argument (at paragraph 92) as inconsistent with the evidence showing that the \u201ctemporary allowance or exception\u201d was indeed an exception and not the norm, and found that it had been implemented \u201cfor good reasons\u201d. He acknowledged that \u201c[i]n hindsight, it might have been preferable for the Claims Administrator to receive Court approval of the exception\u201d\u2014which, he stated, would likely have been provided. But, he went on, \u201cits absence does not vary the terms of the IDSSA.\u201d While the exception resulted in some claimants obtaining an opportunity to make progressive disclosure, to which they were not entitled under the IDSSA, the moving parties had received the benefits to which they were entitled, according to the parties\u2019 intentions and the text and context of the agreement. There was no \u201cgap\u201d to fill.\n[61] Having also found, as noted above, that the moving parties had no entitlement to claim relief on behalf of the class, the supervising judge dismissed the motions.\nIII. Issues on appeal [62] Based on the written and oral submissions of the parties, I would distill the issues on appeal as follows.\n(1) What standard or standards of review apply?\n(2) Did the supervising judge err in interpreting the IDSSA?\n(3) Did the supervising judge err in determining that he had no jurisdiction to grant Ms. Waldron the individual relief she claimed?\n(4) Did the supervising judge err in determining that Ms. Waldron had no entitlement to seek relief on behalf of the class?\n[63] I will consider each of these issues. As will be seen, they are to a large degree interrelated.\n(1) What standard or standards of review apply? [64] Ms. Waldron acknowledges that, as the Supreme Court stated in respect of the IRSSA in Fontaine at para. 35, the IDSSA \u201cis at root a contract\u201d. Its interpretation, like that of other contracts, is therefore reviewable, absent extricable questions of law, as a question of mixed fact and law, on the deferential standard of palpable and overriding error. However, she submits that the correctness standard applies in this appeal because, and to the extent that, it \u201craises extricable questions of law related to the interpretation of the IDSSA and the supervising judge\u2019s jurisdiction under [the] approval order\u201d (appellant\u2019s memorandum at paragraph 23).\n[65] The Attorney General submits that the substantive issues raised in this appeal are principally concerned with interpretation of the IDSSA, and to that extent are subject to review on the deferential palpable and overriding error standard. However, he recognizes that the supervising judge\u2019s determination of the scope of his jurisdiction to intervene raises a question of law, subject to review for correctness.\n[66] Similarly, class counsel rely on Fontaine in submitting that the supervising judge\u2019s interpretation of the IDSSA is reviewable for palpable and overriding error, absent an extricable error of law. They also accept, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in J.W., that Ms. Waldron\u2019s entitlement to obtain the relief sought and the supervising judge\u2019s entitlement to grant it are subject to review for correctness.\n[67] I accept the parties\u2019 substantial agreement on the issue of standards of review. I will consider the second issue identified above\u2014whether the supervising judge erred in interpreting the IDSSA\u2014on the standard of palpable and overriding error, except to the extent that it involves extricable questions of law, which call for correctness review. I will treat the third and fourth issues as reviewable on the standard of correctness.\n[68] Before I proceed with consideration of the remaining issues, it may be helpful to offer, by way of further legal context, a few reminders about the distinctive nature of class action settlements.\nFirst, class action settlements differ from most other settlements of litigation in requiring the approval of a judge before they can take effect: see rule 334.29(1).\nSecond, negotiating a settlement will invariably entail trade-offs and compromise: Ch\u00e2teauneuf v. Canada, 2006 FC 286 at para. 7. We do not know what trade-offs and compromises were made here. Third, the well-established test for judicial approval is that the settlement be shown to be fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of the class as a whole: Condon v. Canada, 2018 FC 522 at para. 17. As the supervising judge recognized, this standard does not require perfection, only reasonableness: 2019 FC 1075 at para. 76. Fourth, the judge\u2019s assessment of a proposed settlement is \u201ca binary, take-it-or-leave-it proposition. [\u2026] The Court is not permitted to change the settlement terms, impose additional terms or promote the interests of certain class members over those of the whole class\u201d: Toronto Standard Condominium Corporation No. 1654 v. Tri-Can Contract Incorporated, 2022 FC 1796 at para. 17. Fifth, the focus on the interests of the class as a whole may mean that a settlement is approved even if it does not meet the needs or demands of particular class members, or benefits some ahead of others: Condon at para 17; Manuge v. Canada, 2013 FC 341 at para. 24; H\u00e9bert v. Wenham, 2020 FCA 186 at para. 9, leave to appeal refused, 2021 CanLII 49683 (SCC). And sixth, a judicially approved settlement is nonetheless binding on every class member who has not opted out of the proceeding: see rule 334.29(2). Here, Ms. Waldron did not opt out of the class proceeding within the period for doing so.\n[69] I will now proceed to the remaining issues.\n(2) Did the supervising judge err in interpreting the IDSSA? [70] Ms. Waldron submits that the supervising judge committed a series of extricable errors of law in interpreting the IDSSA. She submits that (a) contrary to the law governing the interpretation of contracts, the supervising judge relied on the parties\u2019 subjective intention and on post-contract conduct to support his interpretation; (b) he denied Ms. Waldron the benefit of the basic procedural right to amend a claim; (c) he overlooked the principles set out in section 9.03 of the IDSSA, which she says require an interpretation that favours claimants; (d) he made findings of fact for which there was no supporting evidence (which Ms. Waldron also submits was a palpable and overriding error of fact); and (e) he failed to consider the honour of the Crown and reconciliation in his interpretation.\n[71] The intervener the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) makes further submissions asserting error by the supervising judge in failing to consider the honour of the Crown as a relevant interpretive principle. The FSIN also submits that he erred in failing to consider as an element of his interpretation of the IDSSA whether it conforms to international law and Canada\u2019s international obligations.\n[72] The intervener the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) similarly submits that international law norms are applicable in interpreting the IDSSA. It also recounts its knowledge of and experience with issues that arose under the IRSSA, and in particular with Canada\u2019s interpretation and discharge of its document disclosure obligations, the litigation of entitlement to destroy claimants\u2019 records, privacy issues, and procedural fairness.\n[73] I will discuss in sequence these claims of error. I will then consider what follows from my assessment to determine whether any of these claims are made out.\n(a) Subjective intention and post-contract conduct [74] As a document that \u201cis at root a contract,\u201d construing the IDSSA requires ascertaining \u201cthe objective intentions of the parties\u201d: Fontaine at para. 35. That exercise requires reading the contract as a whole, giving the words used their ordinary and grammatical meaning, and doing so consistently with the surrounding circumstances, or factual matrix: Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp., 2014 SCC 53 at paras. 47, 50, 58.\n[75] The factual matrix comprises \u201cobjective evidence of the background facts at the time of the execution of the contract [\u2026], that is, knowledge that was or reasonably ought to have been within the knowledge of both parties at or before the date of contracting\u201d: Sattva at paras. 50, 58. While the surrounding circumstances will be considered, they \u201cmust never be allowed to overwhelm the words of [the] agreement,\u201d or in effect to create a new agreement: Sattva at para. 57.\n[76] Evidence of subjective intention of the parties \u201chas no independent place\u201d in the determination of contractual meaning: Eli Lilly & Co. v. Novopharm Ltd., 1998 CanLII 791 (SCC), [1998] 2 S.C.R. 129 at paras. 54-59; Sattva at para. 59; ING Bank N.V. v. Canpotex Shipping Services Limited, 2017 FCA 47 at paras. 111-112, 117, 120-121, 125.\n[77] Nor does the factual matrix include subsequent or post-contract conduct. This, it has been held, is a category of conduct that may be considered only when ambiguity remains after the text is construed in light of the factual matrix, and only if the court is mindful of the inherent dangers associated with it: Re Canadian National Railways and Canadian Pacific Ltd. (1978), 95 D.L.R. (3d) 252 at 262 (B.C.C.A.), aff\u2019d 1979 CanLII 229 (SCC), [1979] 2 S.C.R. 668; Shewchuk v. Blackmont Capital Inc., 2016 ONCA 912 at paras. 40-46; and for other recent examples, Wade v. Duck, 2018 BCCA 176 at paras. 28, 31; Magasins Hart Inc. v. 3409 Rue Principale Inc., 2020 NBCA 49 at paras. 50-52.\n[78] Ms. Waldron submits that the supervising judge committed extricable legal errors in interpreting the IDSSA by relying on subjective intentions and post-contract conduct. She puts forward at least five instances of this reliance: appellant\u2019s memorandum at paras. 35-40.\nFirst, she submits, he relied on evidence of the parties\u2019 post-contract conduct in the absence of any finding of ambiguity or acknowledgment of the inherent dangers of doing so.\nSecond, she says, he looked to the subjective intentions of the parties to the IDSSA, and conducted an analysis of those intentions separately from his analysis of the text of the IDSSA and the circumstances surrounding its execution. He was wrong, she says, to consider the parties\u2019 intentions separately and \u201cin addition to\u201d the text and context, when conclusions as to their intentions \u201cflow\u201d from the text and factual background and determining their objective intentions is \u201cthe goal of the exercise\u201d.\nThird, she submits, he was wrong to consider it \u201ccompelling\u201d that neither party to the IDSSA supported the moving parties\u2019 position.\nFourth, he relied on the claims administrator\u2019s subjective understanding of the claims process long after the execution and approval of the IDSSA.\nFifth, he relied on the claims administrator\u2019s account of the difficulties a right to amend would entail.\n[79] The dividing line between pre- and post-contract conduct is not always easy to discern. That may be especially so in this case, where the IDSSA incorporated the claims process and claim form, and was therefore not complete until they were finalized and approved. Moreover, in both Fontaine and J.W., the Supreme Court appears to have relied, in interpreting the IRSSA, on conduct that could be seen as post-contractual, as well as the intentions of the parties in negotiating the agreement.\n[80] The issue in Fontaine was whether the IRSSA should be interpreted as requiring that documents generated in the IAP be destroyed, to preserve confidentiality. Under the heading \u201cThe Surrounding Circumstances\u201d (at paras. 42-45), the Supreme Court considered, among other things, (1) evidence that both claimants and alleged perpetrators had relied on assurances of confidentiality, and that, without those assurances, the IAP could not have functioned; (2) evidence that confidentiality was also crucial to the participation of the church defendants; and (3) evidence that, according to the chief adjudicator, confidentiality was often the \u201ckey factor\u201d in whether a claim proceeded. In addition, the Court relied on the finding of the supervising judge in that case that the negotiators of the IRSSA intended the IAP to be a confidential and private process.\n[81] In J.W., the issue was whether, under the IRSSA, decisions of IAP adjudicators were subject to judicial review. Under the heading \u201cJudicial Recourse Is Available Only Where the Adjudicator Failed to Apply the Terms of the IAP,\u201d a four-judge majority considered among other things (at paras. 134-136, 175), the delays that had resulted from court involvement in the claims process during implementation of the settlement agreement, as well as statistics bearing on timeliness, and stated that further court involvement would result in further delay and \u201cwould surely be contrary to the intentions of the parties [\u2026]\u201d in creating the claims process set out in the agreement.\n[82] I return to the question whether the supervising judge made an extricable legal error in relying on subjective intentions and subsequent conduct. In my view, he did so, largely in the manner submitted by Ms. Waldron. I do not agree that he erred in separating his analysis of the parties\u2019 intentions from his analysis of the text and context\u2014the order and manner in which these factors are considered is not material as long as (if applicable) they are considered. But in providing his analysis he did not advert to or apply either the requirement to focus on the parties\u2019 objective rather than subjective intentions or the limits on consideration of post-contract conduct set out above in paragraph 77. While his analysis resembled in some respects that of the Supreme Court in Fontaine and J.W., in my view it fell short in its identification and application of the rules of contractual interpretation. I consider below, in concluding on the issue of contractual interpretation, the consequences of this error.\n(b) Right to amend [83] Ms. Waldron submits (at paragraphs 41 to 43 of her memorandum) that the supervising judge also committed an extricable error of law in his textual interpretation of the IDSSA in concluding that there was \u201cnothing in the IDSSA suggesting that progressive disclosure or the right to file changed Claims was a feature of the Agreement.\u201d She says that the provision in the IDSSA for filing a claim does not preclude the availability of \u201cbasic procedural rights\u201d such as the right to amend, and invokes case law of this Court stating that the purpose of that right is to determine \u201cthe real question in controversy between the parties.\u201d She submits, in consequence, that the IDSSA should be interpreted as including a right on the part of claimants to amend a claim while a decision on the claim is pending.\n[84] I would not accept this submission. There may be an implicit right to amend in some litigation or administrative proceedings (though I note that in the former context, the Federal Courts Rules are explicit in conferring the right, and also in most cases require leave before amendments may be made: see rules 75-76 and 200-201). But the claims process under the IDSSA is a different kind of proceeding; it is prescribed by contract, so that the rules governing litigation do not apply. To recognize an implicit right to amend the IDSSA would also run counter to the \u201centire agreement\u201d and the \u201cno amendment without consent of the parties\u201d clauses of the IDSSA, and would ignore the binding nature of the Agreement and its judicial approval. It would, in addition, deprive class action settlements of any certainty.\n(c) Principles in section 9.03 [85] Ms. Waldron submits (beginning at paragraph 62 of her memorandum) that in his analysis of the text and context of the IDSSA, the supervising judge \u201coverlooked a crucial feature of the Claim Process favouring Claimants, established in section 9.03, entitled \u2018Principles Governing Claims Administration\u2019.\u201d Section 9.03(2), quoted in part above at paragraph 19, states:\nThe intent is to minimize the burden on the Claimants in pursuing their Claims and to mitigate any likelihood of re-traumatization through the Claims Process. The Claims Administrator, Third Party Assessor, and the Exceptions Committee and its Members, shall, in the absence of reasonable grounds to the contrary, assume that a Claimant is acting honestly and in good faith. In considering an Application, the Claims Administrator, Third Party Assessor, and Exceptions Committee and its Members, shall draw all reasonable and favourable inferences that can be drawn in favour of the Claimant, as well as resolving any doubt as to whether a Claim has been established in favour of the Claimant.\n[86] Ms. Waldron submits that \u201csection 9.03 is key to understanding the Claims Process, its purpose and the intent of the parties.\u201d She says that in accordance with a plain reading, \u201cthe Claims Administrator had an obligation to adopt an interpretation of the IDSSA that would allow Claimants to change the level of self-harm self-identified and to file additional information \u2026.\u201d\n[87] In my view, it cannot be said that the supervising judge \u201coverlooked\u201d section 9.03 in interpreting the IDSSA. As the Attorney General points out (at paragraph 47 of his memorandum), the supervising judge referred to the content of the provision in his reasons granting settlement approval: 2019 FC 1075 at paras. 41, 107, 132. In his reasons on Ms. Waldron\u2019s motion, he quoted section 9.03(2) in full (at paragraph 17).\n[88] Moreover, appellate courts must presume that first-instance courts (like the Federal Court) considered and assessed all of the evidence before them, absent proof to the contrary: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 at para. 46; Mahjoub v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FCA 157 at paras. 66-67. Ms. Waldron has not rebutted this presumption.\n[89] In any event, the requirement in section 9.03(2) that \u201call reasonable and favourable inferences\u201d be drawn in the claimant\u2019s favour appears to refer to the assessment of individual claims, not to the structure of the IDSSA\u2019s claims process. The requirement is directed to \u201cthe Claims Administrator, Third Party Assessor, and the Exceptions Committee and its Members.\u201d Their role (with the partial exception of the claims administrator) relates to the disposition of individual claims. While the claims administrator does play a role in establishing that structure, its terms are unlikely to depend on inferences to be drawn concerning the claims of individual class members.\n[90] Similarly, the requirement in section 9.03(2) that claimants be presumed, \u201cin the absence of reasonable grounds to the contrary\u201d, to be \u201cacting honestly and in good faith\u201d also appears not to apply in interpreting the structure of the IDSSA\u2019s claims process. A claimant\u2019s honesty and good faith are important considerations in assessing specific claims under the IDSSA. However, these considerations do not affect the interpretation of the IDSSA or the claims process it establishes.\n(d) Honour of the Crown and reconciliation [91] Ms. Waldron, supported by the intervener FSIN, submits that the supervising judge erred in law by \u201cfailing to apply the rule that the IDSSA\u2019s interpretation must be informed by the honour of the Crown\u201d (Ms. Waldron\u2019s memorandum at paragraph 49; FSIN\u2019s memorandum at paragraphs 14-17). They derive this \u201crule\u201d from a description of the IRSSA set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Fontaine at para. 14: that \u201cthe IRSSA, while not a treaty, \u2018is at least as important as a treaty\u2019 and its interpretation must be informed by the honour of the Crown.\u201d\n[92] However, the passage of the Supreme Court\u2019s reasons on which Ms. Waldron and the FSIN rely is found in Fontaine under the heading \u201cJudicial History\u201d. It merely recounts the reasons of the supervising judge at first instance; it does not represent a holding on the scope or application of the honour of the Crown. The Supreme Court does not return to this subject in the balance of its reasons.\n[93] In Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14 at para. 68, the Supreme Court observed that \u201cnot all interactions between the Crown and Aboriginal people engage [the honour of the Crown]\u201d and that \u201c[i]n the past, it has been found to be engaged in situations involving reconciliation of Aboriginal rights with Crown sovereignty.\u201d\n[94] That is not the situation here. As the supervising judge noted in granting settlement approval (2019 FC 1075 at para. 129), this Court has recognized that while the statement of claim in this proceeding alleged a breach of Aboriginal rights, the IDSSA represents the settlement of tort-based claims involving only individual rights, and has no impact on any collectively held Aboriginal or treaty rights: Cree Nation of Eeyou Istchee (General Council) v. McLean, 2019 FCA 185 at paras. 8, 11; Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated v. McLean, 2019 FCA 186 at paras. 8, 11; Whapmagoostui First Nation v. McLean, 2019 FCA 187 at para. 11. Nor is this proceeding a contest solely between Indigenous peoples on one hand and the Crown on the other: there are Indigenous individuals\u2014including the representative plaintiffs\u2014on both sides of the issues.\n[95] Where the honour of the Crown is engaged in negotiations, it requires among other things that the Crown\u2019s representatives not engage in, or even appear to engage in, \u201csharp dealing\u201d: Manitoba Metis at para. 73. But here it has not been submitted, as I understand it, that there was any \u201csharp dealing\u201d in the negotiation of a settlement agreement that was judicially approved as fair and reasonable.\n[96] Moreover, as this Court stated in Saskatchewan (Attorney General) v. Witchekan Lake First Nation, 2023 FCA 105 at para. 128, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, 40870 (21 Dec 2023), interpretation of a modern agreement from the perspective of the honour of the Crown \u201cdoes not entitle a court to reopen and rewrite the settled terms of a modern agreement negotiated between sophisticated parties over many years and with independent legal advice.\u201d Nor can the honour of the Crown be \u201cused to read in obligations supplementary to or different from those that have been expressly agreed to by the parties [\u2026]\u201d: Witchekan Lake First Nation at para. 129; George Gordon First Nation v. Saskatchewan, 2022 SKCA 41 at para. 172, leave to appeal refused, 2023 CanLII 19734 (SCC).\n[97] It is also apparent from his reasons that the supervising judge was fully aware of the potential for the IDSSA, and its various provisions and benefits, to contribute to reconciliation. His reasons (at paragraph 23) and his reasons on the motion for settlement approval (2019 FC 1075 at paras. 1, 107) make this clear.\n(e) Supporting evidence [98] Ms. Waldron submits (at paragraph 53 of her memorandum) that the conclusion of the supervising judge that \u201cnothing in the IDSSA\u201d could suggest that \u201cthe right to file changed Claims was a feature of the Agreement\u201d constitutes either an error of law or a palpable and overriding factual error because it is unsupported by the evidence.\n[99] She argues in particular that the supervising judge erred in finding (at paragraphs 65 and 70 of his reasons) that \u201ca key factor in the structure of the IDSSA was to avoid many of the problems associated with the IRSSA, including the IAP process and its progressive disclosure feature,\u201d despite agreeing that the term \u201cprogressive disclosure\u201d was not used at the settlement approval hearing.\n[100] However, it is possible to raise or address concerns associated with progressive disclosure without expressly using the term. That, in my view, is what occurred at the settlement approval hearing. In their submissions in support of settlement approval (appeal book at 775-780, 794), class counsel explained the claim form and how it was designed to work. They wanted, they explained, \u201cto try and create something that would be an apparent break,\u201d and were \u201cmindful of not wishing to be involved in [\u2026] an independent assessment process, as was built into the Residential School process.\u201d One of the ways they sought to address their concerns, they explained, was to create clear designations of the levels from 2 to 5, to guide claimants in their selection of a single applicable level. They stated:\nIt is the heart, if you will, of the compensation model. And so it does require the individual to reflect, to have memory awakened or maybe restored, but what is then required is that one of those levels be then selected. That the individual sitting and reflecting on the worst thing that happened to them, chooses one of the levels.\n[\u2026]\nThe question about the compensation being less, or the structure being less or different than in the Indian Residential School. You know, we learn from circumstances. There were many aspects of the Indian Residential School IAP, that frankly we heard time, and time, and time again how destructive it was to the individuals who had to go through it. And it was very much a part and parcel that we would not repeat the process that was part of the IAP.\n[101] The supervising judge found (at paragraph 15 of his reasons) that an overriding goal of the IDSSA was \u201cto avoid the excesses, complexities, and other negative features of the [IRSSA] and its processes.\u201d Particularly in light of the emphasis on claimants selecting a single level, and the relative simplicity of that approach, it was open to the supervising judge to infer that progressive disclosure was among these excesses, complexities, and other negative features. There was no want of support for or palpable and overriding error in his finding.\n(f) Conformity with international law [102] The interveners the AFN and the FSIN submit that the interpretation of the IDSSA must take into account international law norms and instruments, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, G.A. Res. 295, UNGAOR, 61st Sess., Supp. No. 53, UN Doc A\/61\/53 (13 September 2007). I would disregard these submissions: they go beyond the permitted scope of the interventions.\n[103] The Court expressed its concern about the breadth of these interveners\u2019 submissions at the hearing of the appeal. The order of the Court granting the AFN and the FSIN leave to intervene imposed limits on their participation. These included that they (1) not repeat any of the appellant\u2019s submissions, (2) rely only on evidence that is part of the record in this proceeding, and (3) address only issues raised by the notice of appeal.\n[104] These limits are consistent with the principles governing interventions in this Court. An intervener must take the issues identified by the parties as it finds them, and cannot transform them or add to them: Macciacchera (Smoothstreams.tv) v. Bell Media Inc., 2023 FCA 180 at paras. 19-20. The interveners\u2019 oral submissions were subject to the same limitations, since ordinarily, only arguments included in a party\u2019s (or intervener\u2019s) memorandum may be advanced in oral argument: Kilback v. Canada, 2023 FCA 96 at para. 41.\n[105] Ms. Waldron\u2019s notice of appeal raises no issues relating to international law. Accordingly, submissions on this subject do not assist the Court in resolving the issues the parties have raised. I would not consider these submissions further.\n(g) Experience with the IRSSA [106] As noted above, the AFN also makes extensive submissions concerning document disclosure, document destruction, and procedural fairness issues that arose under the IRSSA. While some elements of the experience with the IRSSA are no doubt relevant here, as will be discussed further below, the relevant elements of that experience do not appear to include the specific issues to which the AFN refers. Those issues too go beyond what is raised in the notice of appeal. The facts the AFN asserts also go well beyond the record in this proceeding. I would disregard these submissions as well.\n(h) Conclusion on interpretation of the IDSSA [107] For the reasons I have set out, I conclude that the supervising judge committed an extricable error of law in his interpretation of the IDSSA, in impermissibly taking into account both the subjective intentions of the parties and their post-contract conduct, when the prerequisites for doing so were not met. Although this is the sole ground of attack on his interpretation that has succeeded, his decision on this point is therefore not entitled to deference, and it is appropriate that this Court interpret the agreement afresh, avoiding his error: Apotex Inc. v. ADIR, 2017 FCA 23 at para. 93; Ottawa (City) v. ClubLink Corporation ULC, 2021 ONCA 847 at paras. 46-47, leave to appeal refused, 2022 CanLII 69782 (SCC).\n[108] In doing so I start, as required by Sattva, with the text of the IDSSA, read as a whole. In my view, there are ample indications in the text of the agreement (some of which I have already noted) that it does not contemplate claimants amending their claims, or providing progressive disclosure.\n[109] These include, in the main body of the IDSSA,\nthe definition of \u201cApplication\u201d in section 1.01, which is cast in the singular and makes no reference to the possibility of amendment;\nthe definition of \u201cClaim\u201d in section 1.01, which is also cast in the singular and refers to submitting \u201can Application\u201d;\nthe references in section 9.03, which sets out certain principles governing claims administration, to the \u201cexpeditious\u201d nature of the contemplated process;\nthe references to the provision of further information only in the processes involving the Third Party Assessor and the Exceptions Committee; and\nthe \u201centire agreement\u201d clause in section 1.13.\n[110] There are further indications in Schedule B, entitled \u201cThe Claims Process\u201d:\nthe reference in section 1 to a claimant filing \u201chis\/her application form and all supporting documentation;\u201d and\nthe statement in section 4 that as part of the intake phase, \u201c[the] Claims Administrator sorts the applications of eligible Claimants in accordance with Claimants\u2019 self-identified Levels.\u201d\n[111] In addition, the claim form, as discussed above at paragraphs 25 and 28, expressly calls for claimants to self-select only one level\u2014either level 1 or one of levels 2 to 5.\n[112] On the other hand, like the supervising judge, I see nothing in the text that supports the interpretation that Ms. Waldron asked be adopted.\n[113] I turn then to the factual matrix, as defined in Sattva as \u201cknowledge that was or reasonably ought to have been within the knowledge of both parties at or before the date of contracting.\u201d Its key element here, in my view, is the parties\u2019 knowledge of the issues that arose with the IRSSA and its IAP, including their provision for in-person hearings and progressive disclosure. It was that pre-contractual knowledge that led the parties to adopt the claims process they adopted in the IDSSA, and especially its relatively simple, paper-based process based on self-assessment. The factual matrix therefore favours the interpretation adopted by the parties to the IDSSA.\n[114] I conclude that, despite the error committed by the supervising judge, his interpretation of the IDSSA was correct.\n(3) Did the supervising judge err in determining that he had no jurisdiction to grant Ms. Waldron the individual relief she claimed? [115] In my view, the supervising judge made no error in this regard.\n[116] As noted above, the supervising judge cited in considering the scope for judicial supervision of class action settlements the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in J.W. There, speaking for the majority on this issue, C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. stated (at para. 120) that\nIn the context of the supervision of a settlement agreement, the terms of the agreement are determinative. While supervising judges are not free to approve an agreement that fully ousts their supervisory jurisdiction, their authority is limited and shaped by the terms of the agreement, once it is approved and determined to be fair, reasonable and in the best interests of the class.\n[117] She added (at para. 140) that \u201ccases in which judicial intervention is warranted will be rare,\u201d and adopted as the test for the availability of judicial recourse in relation to the IRSSA a \u201cfailure by the IAP adjudicator to apply the terms of the IAP Model, which amounts to failure to enforce the IRSSA.\u201d She added (at para. 141) that \u201ccircumstances will inevitably arise that were not foreseen by the parties and are therefore not provided for in their agreement,\u201d and that should this situation\u2014a \u201cgap\u201d\u2014arise, \u201ccourts must have the power to intervene to ensure that the parties receive the benefits of the agreement, i.e., what they bargained for.\u201d\n[118] Justice Abella, who wrote on this issue for the minority of the Court, agreed (at para. 28) that there is a high threshold for judicial intervention. Courts nonetheless have a duty, she stated (at para. 30), \u201cto ensure that the claimants receive the benefits they bargained for.\u201d This entails, she further stated (at para. 35), \u201cfocus[ing] on the words of the Agreement, so that the benefits promised to the class members are delivered.\u201d She also recognized (at para. 26) the existence of a \u201cgap\u201d in a settlement agreement as a basis for judicial intervention.\n[119] I have quoted above the provision of the settlement approval order in this case that addresses judicial supervision. I repeat it here for ease of reference:\nThis Court, without in any way affecting the finality of this Order, reserves exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over this action, the Plaintiffs, all Class Members who have not opted out of the Settlement Agreement, and the Defendant for the limited purposes of implementing the Settlement Agreement and enforcing and administering the Settlement Agreement and this Order.\n[120] The supervising judge correctly recognized (at paragraph 48 of his reasons) both the existence of and the limits on his supervisory jurisdiction under the order. He correctly understood that it was \u201cnot the Court\u2019s role to impose terms that it thinks appropriate nor to rewrite the IDSSA.\u201d He correctly recognized (at paragraph 52) that to grant Ms. Waldron what she was seeking would give her relief for which the IDSSA did not provide.\n(4) Did the supervising judge err in determining that Ms. Waldron had no authority to seek relief on behalf of the class? [121] It follows from my conclusion on the preceding question that this question need not be addressed. The reasons why the supervising judge had no jurisdiction to grant Ms. Waldron the personal relief she claimed apply equally to her claim for relief for other class members. However, I will deal briefly with some further aspects of this question.\n[122] In the class proceedings regime, it is ordinarily the representative plaintiff or plaintiffs (or, depending on the nature of the proceeding, one or more representative defendants, applicants, or respondents), who have the right and the responsibility to represent the interests of class members and instruct class counsel on their behalf: see rule 334.16(1)(e); Canada v. John Doe, 2016 FCA 191 at para. 75; Bancroft-Snell at paras. 3-4; Coburn and Watson\u2019s Metropolitan Home v. Home Depot of Canada Inc., 2019 BCCA 308 at paras. 14-16, leave to appeal refused, 2020 CanLII 23626 (SCC) and 2020 CanLII 23639 (SCC).\n[123] Ms. Waldron was not named as a representative plaintiff. Therefore, absent some proper basis to conclude otherwise, she had no entitlement to seek relief on behalf of the class, even if the supervising judge had jurisdiction to grant it.\n[124] I have already noted (at paragraph 13 above) that the supervising judge, in coming to his conclusion on this issue, relied in part on Ms. Waldron\u2019s failure to seek leave under rule 334.31(2). But that rule did not apply in the circumstances before him.\n[125] As this Court has confirmed, rule 334.31(2) applies only where a representative plaintiff or applicant has a right of appeal but chooses not to exercise it. In those circumstances, another class member may seek leave to step into the shoes of the representative party and exercise the right of appeal. To obtain leave, the class member must show that he or she will fairly and adequately represent the class in the appeal, and that the appeal itself is in the best interests of the class: Frame v. Riddle, 2018 FCA 204 at paras. 24-25; Ottawa v. McLean at paras. 11, 13. Even if Ms. Waldron had sought leave under rule 334.31(2), therefore, it would not have availed her: no right of appeal was in issue before the supervising judge.\n[126] However, there was a route through which Ms. Waldron could potentially have sought authority to represent the interests of the class or some of its members\u2014she could have applied for permission to participate in the proceeding under rule 334.23. That rule authorizes the court to permit class members other than the representative plaintiff to participate in a class proceeding. It reads as follows:\n334.23 (1) To ensure the fair and adequate representation of the interests of a class or any subclass, the Court may, at any time, permit one or more class members to participate in the class proceeding.\n(2) When permitting a class member to participate in the proceeding, the Court shall give directions regarding the role of the participant, including matters relating to costs and to the procedures to be followed.\n334.23 (1) Afin que les int\u00e9r\u00eats du groupe ou d\u2019un sous-groupe soient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et ad\u00e9quate, la Cour peut, en tout temps, autoriser un ou plusieurs membres du groupe \u00e0 participer au recours collectif.\n(2) La Cour assortit l\u2019autorisation de directives concernant le r\u00f4le du participant, notamment en ce qui concerne les d\u00e9pens et la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre.\n[127] Ms. Waldron did not seek permission under rule 334.23 either before the supervising judge or in her written representations or oral submissions in this Court. However, while this Court\u2019s decision was under reserve, the current supervising judge (Grammond J.) relied on this rule, together with the law of standing, in granting a class member leave to participate in a motion seeking expressly to amend the IDSSA: McLean v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 1093 at paras. 50-55. (The decision is now on appeal to this Court (Court File A-235-23), but the appeal does not appear to challenge the participation element of the decision.)\n[128] This Court advised the parties and interveners in this appeal that it would consider brief written submissions concerning the Federal Court decision. In response, Ms. Waldron submitted, among other things, that the decision reinforced her position that she should be granted standing. The interveners FSIN and AFN made submissions to the same effect. The FSIN also submitted that a motion is not a prerequisite for the Court to grant Ms. Waldron permission to participate, and referred to decisions under similar provisions in Ontario and British Columbia recognizing that the purpose of rule 334.23 is to protect the interests of class members.\n[129] Class counsel submitted that the rule did not affect the supervising judge\u2019s determination that Ms. Waldron lacked the authority to seek a declaration on behalf of the class. They noted that the reasons of Grammond J. focused on the interest the class member might have in bringing her motion and not \u201cthe extraordinary nature of the relief she was seeking.\u201d The general rule remained, they submitted, that only a court-appointed representative party may act on behalf of and bind the class.\n[130] The Attorney General and the intervener Deloitte did not provide submissions. None of the parties and interveners making submissions sought to provide evidence that might bear on the potential application of rule 334.23. Such evidence would include, for example, evidence of the kind the court must consider when appointing representative parties on certification who will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class, or when appointing another class member under rule 334.31 to exercise the representative parties\u2019 right of appeal: see Ottawa v. McLean at paras. 13, 22.\n[131] Given my conclusion on the jurisdiction of the supervising judge, it is not necessary that I decide on the application of rule 334.23 in order to resolve the questions before the Court. In all of the circumstances, I would decline to do so.\nIV. Proposed disposition [132] I would dismiss the appeal. Consistent with the position of the parties, I would make no award of costs.\n\u201cJ.B.

Context [3] EllisDon Corporation filed a complaint with the Canadian International Trade Tribunal concerning a solicitation issued by the Department of Public Works and Government Services (Public Works) for the rehabilitation and optimization of a building.\n[4] EllisDon alleged that Public Works failed to evaluate the tenders in accordance with the invitation to tender and thereby breached trade agreements. EllisDon sought, among others, compensation for lost opportunity from the date it was awarded the contract to the date the contract was awarded to another tenderer.\n[5] The Tribunal issued its Determination on September 25, 2023 and its reasons on October 10, 2023 (the Decision). The Tribunal found EllisDon\u2019s complaint to be valid. The Tribunal further recommended that Public Works compensate EllisDon for \u201cits lost opportunity, if any\u201d. In this regard, the Tribunal recommended \u201cthat the parties negotiate the amount of compensation, if any\u201d, and that they report back to the Tribunal on the outcome of their negotiations within 60 days of the date of the issuance of the Tribunal\u2019s reasons. Finally, the Tribunal wrote that should the parties be unable to agree \u201con the amount of the compensation\u201d, the Tribunal would establish the final amount of the compensation after having provided the parties with the opportunity to file full submissions on this issue.\n[6] The Attorney General filed a judicial review application of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision. The application states that the Decision is unreasonable and that the Tribunal exceeded its statutory authority when it recommended compensation for EllisDon.\n[7] A few days after the filing of his judicial review application, the Attorney General moved for an order staying his application \u201cuntil 30 days following the outcome of the compensation phase before the Tribunal\u201d.\n[8] As a result of the Attorney General\u2019s motion for a stay, EllisDon asked the Tribunal to hold the compensation phase in abeyance until this Court rules on the Attorney General\u2019s judicial review application or on his motion to stay his application. Despite the Attorney General\u2019s request that the compensation phase continue, the Tribunal decided to hold the compensation phase of EllisDon\u2019s complaint proceeding in abeyance until this Court has ruled on the Attorney General\u2019s motion to stay his application for judicial review.\nII. Analysis [9] Paragraph 50(1)(b) of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 confers a discretionary power on this Court to stay a proceeding before it where \u201cit is in the interests of justice\u201d. The exercise of this discretionary power is guided by certain principles, including securing \u201cthe just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every proceeding on its merits\u201d: Rule 3 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106 (the Rules); Coote v. Lawyers\u2019 Professional Indemnity Company, 2013 FCA 143 at para. 12. In this regard, it will take much to convince this Court to grant a stay where a long period of abeyance is requested or when the ensuing delay will cause harsh effects on a party: Mylan Pharmaceuticals ULC v. AstraZeneca Canada, Inc., 2011 FCA 312 at para. 5.\n[10] The Attorney General says that three \u201ckey circumstances\u201d militate in favour of staying his application.\nA. Negotiations Not Concluded [11] First, the Attorney General argues that this Court should stay his application so that the parties can continue negotiations on the amount of the compensation. Should the parties reach an agreement, the entire matter may be resolved, and if not, the Tribunal will rule on the amount of compensation.\n[12] I disagree that this argument militates in favour of staying the judicial review application. As EllisDon justly notes, parties do no need a stay to negotiate a resolution of their dispute.\n[13] I would add that there is no guarantee that the parties will agree on the amount of the compensation. Failing such an agreement, the Tribunal will have to proceed with the compensation phase of the complaint process. EllisDon submits that this could be a lengthy and costly phase. To support its argument, EllisDon refers to prior decisions from the Tribunal, which illustrate that more than a year may elapse between the Tribunal making a determination on a complaint\u2019s validity and the Tribunal rendering a decision on compensation. For instance, in The Masha Krupp Translation Group Ltd. v. Canada Revenue Agency, the reasons on validity were issued on March 20, 2017 (see 2017 CanLII 149224 (CA CITT)), and the reasons on compensation were issued on October 17, 2018 (see 2018 CanLII 146634 (CA CITT)); in Oshkosh Defense Canada v. Department of Public Works and Government Services, the reasons on validity were issued on July 20, 2016 (see 2016 CanLII 153258 (CA CITT)), and those regarding compensation were issued on December 29, 2017 (see 2018 CanLII 146784 (CA CITT)).\n[14] Highlighting the time that may elapse between a determination on validity and a determination on compensation is in no way meant to criticize the work of the Tribunal. Rather, it is an acknowledgement that the compensation phase of the Tribunal\u2019s work is complex and involves significant financial, accounting and evidentiary work for the parties to file, and for the Tribunal to consider. The point is that telling the parties that they need to proceed to the determination of the amount of the compensation phase of the complaint without further justification would not be in line with the guiding principle of securing the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every proceeding on its merits.\nB. The Scope of the Compensation Remains Undecided [15] The Attorney General argues that the scope of the compensation remains unclear and that the Tribunal should decide this issue before this Court is required to intervene.\n[16] Again, I disagree. The Tribunal identified the scope of the compensation: Public Works is to \u201ccompensate EllisDon for its lost opportunity cost in this instance\u201d: Decision at paras. 72, 83, 90.\n[17] Furthermore, the sole ground of review raised in the Attorney General\u2019s judicial review application is that the Tribunal allegedly \u201cexceeded its statutory authority when it recommended compensation for EllisDon\u2019s alleged lost opportunity\u201d. During the validity phase of EllisDon\u2019s complaint, Public Works made the same argument and the Tribunal rejected it: Decision at paras. 67-72. It follows that the Tribunal will not revisit the issue of the compensation\u2019s scope nor whether it had authority to recommend it. Indeed, the Decision makes clear that the next phase of the complaint process will be dedicated to establishing the \u201camount\u201d of the compensation, either by way of negotiation between the parties or, if necessary, by the Tribunal: Decision at para. 90.\n[18] In this context, it would defy logic for this Court to acquiesce to the Attorney General\u2019s request to stay the proceeding to let the Tribunal decide an issue that it will not decide.\nC. Judicial Economy [19] The Attorney General\u2019s last argument is that the bifurcation of the Tribunal\u2019s determination\u2014the validity of the complaint phase and the amount of compensation phase\u2014mandates that his application for judicial review be stayed. Otherwise, there is a risk of costly duplication of judicial resources and inconsistent findings flowing from:\n\u2022the possibility that a negotiated settlement on the amount of the compensation or the Tribunal\u2019s determination of that amount will render the judicial review application unnecessary; and\n\u2022the possibility of two judicial review applications: the one presently before this Court and a second one regarding the amount of the compensation.\n[20] While I agree that unnecessary judicial proceedings, duplication of judicial resources, and inconsistent findings should be avoided, I do not think that there is such a risk of these situations happening if I do not grant a stay of the Attorney General\u2019s judicial review application. Let me explain.\n[21] As this Court has stated, \u201c[b]ifurcation, without more, is not a golden ticket to a stay\u201d: Laperri\u00e8re v. D. & A. MacLeod Company Ltd., 2010 FCA 84 at para. 21. This is particularly true when the two phases of a proceedings are not \u201cinextricably linked\u201d: Clayton v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 1 at para. 19. Here, there is no need for the amount of the compensation to be known for this Court to rule on whether the Tribunal had the statutory authority to recommend compensation for lost opportunity cost. Moreover, a determination of the amount of compensation will not resolve the issue of the Tribunal\u2019s statutory authority such that, if Public Works disagrees with an amount determined by the Tribunal, the Attorney General will pursue the present judicial review application. By contrast, as EllisDon points out, a decision of this Court that the Tribunal did not have the statutory authority will put to rest the issue of the amount of the compensation. It is therefore in the parties\u2019 interest to find out at the earliest opportunity whether the Tribunal had the authority to recommend compensation for lost opportunity.\n[22] Not only will this knowledge determine the necessity of the second phase of the complaint before the Tribunal, but it might also save considerable costs to the parties if this second phase proves unnecessary. At paragraphs [13] and [14] above, I highlighted how complex and demanding the determination of the amount of compensation phase could be. Such a complex and demanding process is likely to entail significant costs to the parties. These costs should not be incurred unless necessary, but this necessity will not be known if the Attorney General\u2019s judicial review application is stayed.\n[23] In light of the above, I conclude that judicial economy and the interests of justice do not support the Attorney General\u2019s request for a stay of his judicial review application.\nIII. Conclusion [24] Consequently, the motion for a stay will be dismissed with costs in favour of the respondent.\n\"Nathalie Goyette\"\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-289-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA v.

Wilson, 2023 FC 1289, 2023 CarswellNat 3646, per Strickland J.), the Federal Court granted a judicial review application, set aside a decision of a band election appeal committee and remitted the question whether there had been an election irregularity to a differently constituted band election committee. The Federal Court set strict deadlines within which the redetermination was to take place. The election appeal committee was accordingly reconstituted, considered the matter, declared the election invalid and required a new election take place in short order. That election has now been held.\n[3] The respondents subsequently filed a motion under rule 369.2 of the Federal Court Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106 to dismiss the appeal on the basis that it was moot. The motion came before Stratas J.A on November 28, 2023 (Wilson v. Meeches, 2023 FCA 233, 2023 CarswellNat 4752). I will not repeat his detailed review of the events leading up to the decision in the Federal Court and thereafter; it is sufficient to say that Stratas J.A. observed that the Federal Court judgment was fully implemented. However, he concluded that the question whether the appeal should be dismissed on the basis that it was moot required a full panel of this Court and was to be determined on written submissions.\n[4] The appellants resist the motion to dismiss their appeal. The substance of the appellants\u2019 argument is that there are significant legal issues arising from the judgment of the Federal Court and in respect of which the Federal Court erred. They argue that the Court\u2019s guidance on these issues would assist the Long Plain First Nation electorate going forward and also guide future election committees in the execution of their responsibilities.\n[5] Whether an appeal that is otherwise moot ought nevertheless be heard is a discretionary decision, governed by the well-known criteria in Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), 1989 CanLII 123 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342: the existence of an adversarial relationship, whether the question is elusive of review, judicial economy and the overarching question of the best interest of the administration of justice (at 358-363).\n[6] I would not exercise this Court\u2019s discretion to hear this appeal. I am not persuaded that the legal issues raised by the appellants need to be addressed at this time or are elusive of review. Should these issues arise in the future, there are many steps available to the appellants to preserve their interests; including an interim stay motion, which can be brought in very short order with minimal procedural requirements.\n[7] Stratas J.A. gave clear and complete guidance as to how steps can be taken to preserve legal rights pending an appeal, including a motion for an interim stay, which is temporary, brought on an urgent basis and designed to preserve matters before the Court decides whether the judgment under appeal ought to be stayed pending appeal. An interim stay having been obtained, parties can move quickly to file a motion for a stay and request an expedited hearing of the appeal on the merits. Again, adverting to Stratas J.A. in the earlier motion (at paras. 29 and 21):\nThis Court is \u201caccessible 24 hours a day, [every day of the] year, from coast to coast for urgent applications, in both official languages\u201d: Brown [v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FCA 130, [2021] 1 F.C.R. 53] at para. 159. When necessary, this Court can act quickly outside of normal working hours, even on the evening of a quiet public holiday\u2026 In the Federal Courts system, things can and do move fast, especially when a party asks us to go fast. For us, \u201caccess to justice\u201d is much more than an attractive slogan in a tweet or a lofty phrase in a news release. It has been a call to action. And, for a long time, plenty of action there has been. See the article by Professor Gerard Kennedy, \u201cThe Federal Courts Advantage in Civil Procedure\u201d (October 31, 2023), online: https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4619359.\n[8] I am therefore not satisfied that the appellants will inevitably or necessarily be prejudiced should these issues arise again. There is no procedural reason why the correctness of the Federal Court decision cannot be put before this Court in another appeal without prejudice to the rights of the parties.\n[9] It is also preferable that important legal questions be decided in a factual context and between parties with opposing perspectives. Should the legal questions raised in the Notice of Appeal filed in respect of the Federal Court decision under appeal arise in the future, as counsel suggests they will, they can be addressed at that time and in that context, where there is a live controversy between parties with opposing interests.\n[10] I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\"Donald J.

Introduction [1] This appeal, which arises from a unique set of circumstances, involves the class definition in the context of class proceedings.\n[2] More particularly, at issue in this appeal is whether it was open to the Judge of the Federal Court (the certification judge) to reinstate the Family Class as part of the class definition originally certified after its inadvertent removal from the certification order.\n[3] For the reasons that follow, the appeal should be allowed.\nII. Procedural History [4] Four years ago, on January 23, 2020, in Greenwood v. Canada, 2020 FC 119 (Greenwood FC), the certification judge granted an order certifying a class proceeding against the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The Class included two groups\u2014the Class and the Family Class\u2014and was defined as follows:\nAll persons who reside in Canada who were or are Regular Members, Special Constables Members, Reservists, Supernumerary Special Constables, Civilian Members, and Public Service Employees under s. 10 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, RSC 1985, c R-10, Volunteers, Auxiliary Constables, Non-Profit Employees, Temporary Civilian Employees, Casual Employees, Term Employees, Cadets, Pre-Cadets, Students, Contract Employees, Municipal Employees, and others who work or worked with the RCMP (the \u201cClass\u201d); and\nAll individuals who are entitled to assert a claim pursuant to the Family Law Act, RSO 1990 c F.3, and equivalent or comparable legislation in other provinces and territories (the \u201cFamily Class\u201d)\n[5] A week later, on January 31, 2020, the respondents filed notice of a motion to vary the Greenwood FC certification order on the basis that the class definition was erroneous. Specifically, the certification judge had mistakenly included the initially proposed class definition, notwithstanding the fact that the respondents had previously filed a revised class definition.\n[6] Nearly simultaneously, on February 3, 2020, the appellant filed a notice of appeal in this Court against the order granting the certification in Greenwood FC.\n[7] On April 21, 2020, the certification judge granted the respondents\u2019 motion to vary the certification order. In so doing, the certification judge amended the class definition (April 2020 Order, unreported):\nThe definition of the Class shall be:\nAll persons who reside in Canada who worked with or for the RCMP being all current or former:\nRCMP Members: including all Regular Members, Civilian Members, Special Constables, Special Constable Members, Supernumerary Special Constables, Reservists, and Recruits;\nPublic Service Employees (\u201cPSEs\u201d) who are not able to grieve under s. 208 of the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 2 (\u201cFPSLRA\u201d): including all indeterminate, term. And casual PSEs; and\nOthers who work within RCMP workplaces: including but not limited to; temporary civilian employees, community constables, auxiliary constables, cadets, pre-cadets, students, independent and subcontractor employees (including Commissionaires, custodial worker, guards\/matrons, individuals employed through temporary agencies, and interns \u2013 e.g. Youth Internship Program), other government employees (including municipal, regional or similar levels of government employees and seconded officers and employees, including Interchange Canada participants) who are not entitled to grieve under s. 208 of the FPSLRA, volunteers, and non-profit organization employees; individuals working or attending courses on RCMP premises; and any other individuals who worked with or for the RCMP and who have a Human Resources management Information Services (\u201cHRMIS\u201d) identification.\n[8] However, the above amendments inadvertently removed the Family Class from the certification order. The parties did not notice the omission at this point.\n[9] On September 21, 2021, this Court issued its decision regarding the appeal of the amended Greenwood FC certification order. This Court found that the certification judge had erred in defining the Class and in certifying one of the common questions (Canada v. Greenwood, 2021 FCA 186, [2021] 4 FCR 635 (Greenwood FCA) (leave to appeal to SCC refused, 39885 (March 17, 2022)). This Court accordingly ordered that the class definition be curtailed to only include RCMP Members and Reservists. This Court thus set aside the amended Greenwood FC certification order and remitted it to the Federal Court to be revised in accordance with this Court\u2019s judgment.\n[10] Subsequently, on July 8, 2022, the respondents wrote to the Federal Court to raise the question of the inadvertent omission of the Family Class from the April 2020 Order:\nIn [their January 29, 2020 Motion to Vary], the Plaintiffs inadvertently used the Primary Class Definition as a standalone Revised Class Definition, instead of consolidating it with the FLA Class that was separately referenced in a later part of the Memorandum of Law.\nThis had the unintended effect of removing the FLA Class from the certified class definition, despite the fact that it was advanced (and responded to) at certification, and was certified by this Court in both its reasons and order.\n[11] On September 20, 2022, the certification judge made the amendments to the certification order as required by this Court\u2019s judgment in Greenwood FCA (2022 FC 1317). She did so on the understanding that the respondents would soon thereafter bring a motion to vary addressing the issue of the exclusion of the Family Class in the April 2020 Order.\n[12] In the interim, the appellant indicated that it did not consent to having the Family Class reinstated into the class definition.\n[13] On February 24, 2023, the certification judge heard the respondents\u2019 motion to vary regarding the question of the omission of the Family Class from the class definition.\n[14] On March 22, 2023, the certification judge granted the respondents\u2019 motion and amended the certification order by reinstating the Family Class to the class definition (Greenwood v. Canada, 2023 FC 397). This is the Order under challenge in the current appeal. It will be referred to as the Order under Appeal.\nIII. The Order under Appeal [15] In rendering the Order under Appeal, the certification judge acknowledged that the respondents\u2019 counsel was not solely responsible for the inadvertent omission of the Family Class. She noted that the Court itself had failed to flag the omission and that the appellant had not raised it either (Order under Appeal at paras 4\u20135).\n[16] The certification judge then proceeded to address the appellant\u2019s arguments against re-certification for the purposes of reinstating the Family Class. The appellant\u2019s arguments were put forward on the following grounds: (1) the doctrine of issue estoppel, (2) the doctrine of functus officio, (3) the lack of \u201csome basis in fact,\u201d and (4) the unworkability of the Family Class definition. Prior to addressing the grounds as raised by the appellant, the certification judge stated that, in her view, Rule 334.19 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106 (the Rules) conferred the necessary power to amend the certification order.\n[17] The certification judge then turned to the appellant\u2019s arguments. Firstly, in connection with issue estoppel, the certification judge ruled that the circumstances did not preclude her from amending the certification order to include the Family Class. Specifically, she found that the issue at hand had not been finally determined by either the Greenwood FCA decision or her own Order of April 2020. In the words of the certification judge (1) the \u201cFCA decision does not directly address the Family Class claim\u201d and (2) \u201cmotions at the class certification stage are essentially procedural motions and do not involve decisions on the merits\u201d (Order under Appeal at paras 17, 19).\n[18] Regarding the application of the doctrine of functus officio, the certification judge ruled that the doctrine only applies to final decisions and that certification orders do not constitute \u201ca final finding on the merits of a case\u201d (Order under Appeal at para. 24). She added that should the doctrine apply, there exists an exception to its application \u201cwhere there is a slip-up or error in expressing a court\u2019s manifested intention or statutory power to revisit an order\u201d (ibid. at para. 25).\n[19] With respect to the appellant\u2019s argument that there was a lack of \u201csome basis in fact\u201d to support the existence of the Family Class, the certification judge ruled that there had been no change in circumstances since the original certification order that would allow her to revisit the evidence (Order under Appeal at paras 29\u201335). She further noted that she did not consider this Court\u2019s decision in Greenwood FCA as invalidating her Family Class findings and analysis (ibid. at para. 33).\n[20] Finally, the certification judge addressed the appellant\u2019s argument regarding the workability of the Family Class definition by finding that \u201cthe Family Class is a derivative class\u2026 It is therefore inaccurate to say the Family Class is unidentifiable\u201d (Order under Appeal at para. 37).\n[21] As a result, the certification judge reinstated the Family Class as part of the class definition.\nIV. Standard of Review [22] The standards of review applicable to an appeal from a decision of the Federal Court are those set out in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235: palpable and overriding error for questions of fact, and correctness for questions of law. For questions of mixed fact and law, correctness will apply to any extricable question of law, otherwise the standard of palpable and overriding error will apply.\nV. Issues [23] This appeal raises the following issues:\nDid the certification judge err in her application of Rule 334.19? Did the certification judge err in her application of the doctrines of issue estoppel and functus officio?\nVI. Analysis A. Did the certification judge err in her application of Rule 334.19? [24] In the Order under Appeal, the certification judge ruled at the outset of her analysis that the wording of Rule 334.19 \u201cprovides the Court with the necessary jurisdiction and discretion to consider this Motion\u201d (Order under Appeal at para. 13).\n[25] Rule 334.19 provides that:\nAmendment and decertification\nModification ou retrait de l\u2019ordonnance\n334.19 A judge may, on motion, amend an order certifying a proceeding as a class proceeding or, if the conditions for certification are no longer satisfied with respect to the proceeding, decertify it.\n334.19 Le juge peut, sur requ\u00eate, modifier l\u2019ordonnance d\u2019autorisation ou, si les conditions d\u2019autorisation ne sont plus respect\u00e9es, retirer l\u2019autorisation\n[26] As such, the certification judge relied on Rule 334.19 to conclude that it was not necessary to consider whether the proposed Family Class met the requirements for certification since she had already done so in Greenwood FC.\n[27] It is a given that had the respondents moved to vary the certification order to restore the Family Class before this Court\u2019s decision in Greenwood FCA, it would have been open to the certification judge to reinstate the Family Class on the basis of her findings and analysis with respect to the initial certification motion.\n[28] However, the situation before the certification judge was different. Indeed, the respondents\u2019 motion to reinstate the Family Class was brought after this Court issued its judgment in Greenwood FCA.\n[29] In Greenwood FCA, this Court partially reversed Greenwood FC, finding that the certification judge had erred in her application of the \u201csome basis in fact\u201d requirement with regard to the evidence on record (Greenwood FCA at paras 128\u201339, 165\u201375). This Court indicated as follows in this regard (ibid. at paras 167, 169):\n[A] motion judge must be satisfied that there is some basis in fact for the final four criteria for certification. If there was no evidence before a motion judge that is capable of supporting a determination that there is some basis in fact for these criteria, the certification order will be tainted by palpable and overriding error and may be set aside.\n\u2026\nWhile the \u201csome basis in fact\u201d requirement establishes a lesser standard than the balance of probabilities, a plaintiff is nonetheless required to set out a factual underpinning to support the existence of claims on behalf of class members\u2026\n[30] In restoring the Family Class as part of the class definition, the certification judge overlooked this Court\u2019s ruling in Greenwood FCA.\n[31] Indeed, the class definition considered in Greenwood FCA was the definition that formed part of the April 2020 Order, which is the Order that did not include the Family Class. The Family Class issue was not before our Court in Greenwood FCA, as the certification judge acknowledged herself (Order under Appeal at para. 17). Although our Court in Greenwood FCA did refer to the Family Class at paragraphs 5 and 14, it merely did so in reference to the respondents\u2019 statement of claim. As such, it cannot be alleged that our Court considered the issue of whether there was \u201csome basis in fact\u201d for the certification of the Family Class as part of the class definition. The certification judge accordingly erred in relying on those paragraphs from Greenwood FCA to conclude that our Court has somehow endorsed her analysis with respect to the Family Class (Order under Appeal at para. 34). To the contrary, the reasoning in Greenwood FCA required the certification judge to perform an analysis and reconsider whether the Family Class met the criteria for certification in light of the guidance provided by our Court.\n[32] The decision in Greenwood FCA provided the basis for the certification judge to exercise her discretion and reconsider the Family Class in ruling on the respondents\u2019 motion to vary. Specifically, given the circumstances, she had the obligation to revisit the Family Class with a view to determine whether there was \u201csome basis in fact\u201d in the evidentiary record to support its inclusion as part of the class definition. It was not open to the certification judge to simply reinstate her initial findings after having been overturned by this Court. The reinstatement of the Family Class in the certification order, absent a \u201csome basis in fact\u201d analysis conducted consistently with the guidance set forth by this Court in Greenwood FCA, amounts to an error of law.\n[33] The certification judge\u2019s error in her application of Rule 334.19 is sufficient to dispose of this appeal. The doctrines of estoppel and functus officio are not determinative of this appeal and the appellant conceded that, \u201cin the circumstances of this case, it would be open to the Court to depart from a strict application of those doctrines\u201d (Memorandum of fact and law of the Appellant at para. 62).\n[34] However, the certification judge suggested that, as a matter of principle, issue estoppel and functus officio never apply to procedural motions like certification motions. In my view, this was a further error that our Court is required to address.\nB. Did the certification judge err in her application of the doctrine of issue estoppel and functus officio? (1) Issue estoppel [35] Issue estoppel is a common law doctrine that provides that once a judicial proceeding finally decides an issue, neither party can re-litigate that issue. The doctrine rests on the finality principle. As aptly summarized by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Smith Estate v National Money Mart Company, 2008 ONCA 746, 303 DLR (4th) 175 at para. 33: \u201c[o]nce a point has been decided, the winning litigant is entitled to rely on the result, to be assured of peace and to be able to plan the future on the basis of the court\u2019s decision.\u201d The doctrine also exists to preserve scare judicial resources and prevent parties from exposure to additional legal costs, as well as to reduce the risk of undue litigation (Penner v. Niagara (Regional Police Services Board), 2013 SCC 19, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 125 at para. 28).\n[36] It is well established that issue estoppel emerges in the presence of three preconditions (Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., 2001 SCC 44, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 460 at para. 25 (Danyluk)):\n(1) the same question has been decided;\n(2) the judicial decision which is said to create the estoppel was final; and,\n(3) the parties to the judicial decision or their privies were the same persons as the parties to the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised or their privies.\n[37] Furthermore, even if all the preconditions are established, a judge will retain a broad discretion to refuse to apply the doctrine of issue estoppel if its application were to create an injustice (Danyluk at para. 33):\nThe first step is to determine whether the moving party \u2026 has established the preconditions to the operation of issue estoppel \u2026 If successful, the court must still determine whether, as a matter of discretion, issue estoppel ought to be applied \u2026 [emphasis in original]\n[38] In the present case, and I agree with the appellant on this point, the certification judge conflated whether the issue at hand was finally resolved with whether the entirety of the claim was finally determined. She did so in a cursory manner, without reference to the relevant case law.\n[39] Indeed, there are decisions stating that the doctrine of issue estoppel applies to interlocutory orders (Hawley v. North Shore Mercantile Corp., 2009 ONCA 679, 99 O.R. (3d) 142 at para. 26, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 33440 (April 22 2010), citing Fidelitas Shipping Co. v. V\/O Exportchieb, [1965] 2 All E.R. 4 at 10 (CA UK); see also R. v. Duhamel, 1981 ABCA 295 at para. 14, aff\u2019d [1984] 2 S.C.R. 555). More particularly, in the context of class proceedings, a number of decisions confirm that issue estoppel applies to class certification motions with the understanding that judges retain discretion not to apply it when they are of the view it would lead to an injustice (see Risorto v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., [2009] O.J. No. 820, 72 C.C.L.I. (4th) 60 at para. 49; Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd. v. Microsoft Corporation, 2014 BCSC 1280, 376 D.L.R. (4th) 302 at paras 28\u201330, 60, 78 (Pro-Sys); Turner v. York University, 2011 ONSC 6151, 209 A.C.W.S. (3d) 228 at paras 63\u201365; Corless v. Bell Mobility Inc., 2023 ONSC 6227 at paras 51\u201358 (Corless); Fanshawe College of Applied Arts and Technology v. LG Philips LCD Co., 2016 ONSC 3958, 270 A.C.W.S. (3d) 23 at paras 43\u201353).\n[40] While certification orders do not dispose of the entire proceeding, they may yield final rulings on issues going to the merits of the case, such as class definitions and common questions. As it was put by our Court in Apotex Inc. v. Merck & Co. (C.A.), 2002 FCA 210, [2003] 1 F.C. 242 at para. 27:\nThe decision which is said to give rise to the estoppel need not be a decision which determines the entire subject-matter of the litigation. The test for issue estoppel is a substantive issue test where the decision affects substantive rights of the parties with respect to a matter bearing on the merits of the cause of action.\n[41] Accordingly, certification orders issued in the context of class proceedings may be subject to issue estoppel. Although Rule 334.19 contemplates the possibility of amending a certification order, it does not displace the doctrine of issue estoppel that exists to prevent re-litigation. Both the rule and the doctrine have to be taken into account and the judge\u2019s discretion has to be exercised consequently and appropriately (Pro-Sys at para. 28). Any other approach would undermine judicial economy (which the doctrine of issue estoppel fundamentally seeks to protect) by allowing litigants to repeatedly and endlessly re-open certification orders.\n[42] That being said, there are circumstances where the doctrine of issue estoppel can be set aside, namely in the event of an appeal, a material change in circumstances, or new evidence (Donald J. Lange, The Doctrine of Res Judicata in Canada, 5th ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis, 2021) at 328).\n[43] In the present case, prior to Greenwood FCA, it would have been open to the respondents to move to vary the certification order to reinstate the Family Class, as the certification judge remained bound by her previous Family Class findings. However, from the moment this Court issued its judgment in Greenwood FCA and partially reversed the certification judge, issue estoppel ceased to apply by virtue of the appeal exception. As of that moment, and for reasons that differ from those of the certification judge, the Family Class was no longer barred by issue estoppel as the analysis grounding its inclusion in the class definition was no longer valid.\n(2) Functus officio\n[44] Simply put, the functus officio doctrine provides that once a matter is finally ruled upon, the judge has discharged its office and cannot re-open the matter. Indeed, to do so would impede on \u201corderly appellate procedure\u201d (Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Manitoba, 2021 SCC 33, 461 D.L.R. (4th) 635 at para. 34).\n[45] In the Order under Appeal, the certification judge found that the doctrine of functus officio could not apply, as certification orders do not involve final findings on the merits of the case. This conclusion stems from the certification judge\u2019s same misunderstanding regarding the meaning of \u201cfinal\u201d in the context of the doctrine of issue estoppel. As explained in these reasons, certification orders can be considered final orders for the purpose of class proceedings, and it follows that the doctrine of functus officio can accordingly be applied to certification orders.\nVII. Proposed disposition [46] I would allow the appeal, set aside the Order of the Federal Court (2023 FC 397) and remit the question of the Family Class to the certification judge. The certification judge should provide an analysis and revisit the \u201csome basis in fact\u201d requirement for the certification of the Family Class. In the event that the certification judge determines that the Family Class should be certified, she should also thoroughly examine the workability of its definition.\n[47] In accordance with Rule 334.39, I would make no order as to costs.\n\"Richard Boivin\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nMary J.L.

The two are identical, there being no confidential information disclosed in the confidential reasons.\nLOCKE J.A.\nI. Background [1] This is an appeal of a decision of the Federal Court (2022 FC 1218, per Justice Michael D. Manson) in the context of an action brought pursuant to subsection 6(1) of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations, S.O.R.\/93-133. In that action, the respondents, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. (collectively, Janssen), sought a declaration that the appellant, Pharmascience Inc. (Pharmascience), would infringe Canadian Patent No. 2,655,335 (the 335 Patent) if it were to make, use or sell its generic version of Janssen\u2019s patented medicine called INVEGA SUSTENNA.\n[2] INVEGA SUSTENNA involves a suspension of paliperidone palmitate for the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders. The 335 Patent teaches a regimen to achieve an optimum plasma concentration-time profile. It teaches a first loading dose administered in the deltoid muscle on day 1, a second loading dose administered in the deltoid muscle on day 8, and then monthly maintenance doses thereafter administered either in the deltoid or gluteal muscle. For non-renally impaired patients, the first and second loading doses are 150 and 100 mg equivalent (mg-eq.), respectively, and the monthly maintenance doses are 75 mg-eq. each. For renally impaired patients, the first and second loading doses are 100 and 75 mg-eq., respectively, and the monthly maintenance doses are 50 mg-eq. each.\n[3] Pharmascience defended against Janssen\u2019s action on a number of grounds. The only ground that remains relevant for the purposes of this appeal is that the claims of the 335 Patent are invalid because they comprise unpatentable subject matter, namely methods of medical treatment. The Federal Court rejected this allegation and found the claims of the 335 Patent valid.\n[4] It will be necessary in this decision to explore somewhat the history and nature of the prohibition against patenting methods of medical treatment. For the reasons set out below, I would dismiss the present appeal.\nII. The Federal Court\u2019s Decision [5] The Federal Court addressed the question of methods of medical treatment at paragraphs 160 to 172 of its reasons.\n[6] After noting that the prohibition against patenting methods of medical treatment has its origin in the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Tennessee Eastman Co. v. Commissioner of Patents, [1974] S.C.R. 111, 33 D.L.R. (3d) 459 (Tennessee Eastman), and then observing that the jurisprudence in this area is inconsistent, the Federal Court stated that the starting point is to ask, \u201cwhat do the claims say?\u201d (see paragraph 161 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons, citing Bayer Inc. v. Cobalt Pharmaceuticals Company, 2013 FC 1061, 121 C.P.R. (4th) 14 at para. 162 (Bayer)).\n[7] The Federal Court then considered Pharmascience\u2019s argument that the dosage range for the maintenance dose (from 25 to 150 mg-eq., according to the product monograph for INVEGA SUSTENNA) indicates that no particular dose will work for every patient, and that selection of the appropriate dose for a specific patient will require skill and judgment from the prescriber.\n[8] The Federal Court noted that it is well settled that claims to a vendible product are not prohibited as methods of medical treatment. It went on to conclude that the method of medical treatment analysis was relevant only to use claims, which it identified as claims 17 to 32 of the 335 Patent (use of a dosage form), and not to the product claims, which it identified as claims 1 to 16 (pre-filled syringes), claims 33 to 48 (how a medicament is prepared), and claims 49 to 63 (a dosage form).\n[9] At paragraph 164 of its reasons, the Federal Court noted that the focus should be on whether professional skill and judgment are required to practise the claimed invention, and cited jurisprudence to the effect that:\nclaims restricted to particular dosages and specific administration schedules have been found to be patentable subject matter, where the amounts and timing are fixed \u2026 whereas claims to dosages or schedules with ranges within which the physician must exercise skill and judgment have been found to not be a vendible product and thus not patentable [references omitted].\n[10] However, the Federal Court also noted that the dichotomy it described (between fixed and variable dosages and schedules) has a questionable underpinning. On this point, it cited the following passage from this Court\u2019s decision in Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research, 2020 FCA 30, 316 A.C.W.S. (3d) 537 at para. 52 (Hospira):\nThis state of the jurisprudence has a tempting simplicity. However, it is not clear to me that the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada that form the basis of the principle that methods of medical treatment are not patentable justify a distinction between a fixed dosage (or interval of administration) and a range of dosages (or intervals). It would seem that a medical professional will be constrained in their exercise of skill in either case. Also, a drug is arguably no less a vendible product simply because its dosage or interval of administration is not fixed.\n[11] The Federal Court found that claims 17 to 32 of the 335 Patent do not require professional skill and judgment because there are no choices to make on dosage amounts, which are all fixed. It found that choices concerning dosing windows and injection sites had no clinical implications, and hence did not interfere with a physician\u2019s skill and judgment. The Federal Court noted that a physician could choose whether to prescribe the claimed dosing regimen, but no skill or judgment was involved in implementing it.\n[12] The Federal Court concluded that the 335 Patent discloses patentable subject matter.\nIII. Issues [13] Pharmascience argues that the Federal Court erred in law in two respects:\nIn excluding claims 1 to 16 and 33 to 63 of the 335 Patent from the method of medical treatment analysis on the basis that they concern a vendible product; and\nIn determining that the claims in issue are patentable on the basis of the dichotomy between fixed and variable dosing regimens.\n[14] I will address each of these arguments in turn after first discussing the key jurisprudence on the method of medical treatment exclusion.\nIV. Standard of Review [15] The parties agree that the standard of review applicable in this case is as set out in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. Questions of law are reviewed on a standard of correctness, and questions of fact or of mixed fact and law from which no question of law is extricable are reviewed on a standard of palpable and overriding error. A palpable error is one that is obvious. An overriding error is one that goes to the very core of the outcome of the case. When arguing palpable and overriding error, it is not enough to pull at leaves and branches and leave the tree standing. The entire tree must fall: Canada v. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 FCA 165, [2012] F.C.J. No. 669 at para. 46 (cited with approval in Benhaim v. St-Germain, 2016 SCC 48, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 352 at para. 38).\n[16] Pharmascience describes all of the questions in dispute as being questions of law subject to the standard of correctness. Pharmascience does not argue that the Federal Court made any errors that are subject to the palpable and overriding error standard. I accept Pharmascience\u2019s approach.\nV. Analysis A. Jurisprudence concerning the prohibition on patenting methods of medical treatment [17] The Patent Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, contains no explicit prohibition against claims for methods of medical treatment. Moreover, subsection 43(2) of the Patent Act provides that a patent is presumed valid. Claims are presumed not to concern methods of medical treatment, and the burden rests on the challenger (Pharmascience, in this case) to prove otherwise.\n[18] As indicated above, the origin of this prohibition in Canada is the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s 1974 decision in Tennessee Eastman. That case involved an attempt to obtain a patent claiming a surgical method for joining or bonding the surfaces of incisions or wounds in living animal tissue by applying adhesive compounds described in the claims in a liquid state, directly to at least one of the tissue surfaces to be bonded. At the time, subsection 41(1) of the Patent Act generally prohibited claims to \u201csubstances prepared or produced by chemical processes and intended for food or medicine\u201d. Therefore, the bonding compounds of the patent application in question could not be claimed as such.\n[19] The Supreme Court maintained the rejection of the patent application by the Commissioner of Patents. Its analysis surrounded the definition of \u201cinvention\u201d in the Patent Act. At page 118, the Court wrote:\nIt is clear that a new substance that is useful in the medical or surgical treatment of humans or of animals is an \u201cinvention\u201d. It is equally clear that a process for making such a substance also is an \u201cinvention\u201d. In fact, the substance can be claimed as an invention only \u201cwhen prepared or produced by\u201d such a process. But what of the method of medical or surgical treatment using the new substance? Can it too be claimed as an invention? In order to establish the utility of the substance this has to be defined to a certain extent. In the case of a drug, the desirable effects must be ascertained as well as the undesirable side effects. The proper doses have to be found as well as methods of administration and any counter\u2011indications. May these therapeutic data be claimed in themselves as a separate invention consisting in a method of treatment embodying the use of the new drug? I do not think so, and it appears to me that s. 41 definitely indicates that it is not so.\n[20] At page 119, the Court added, \u201c[h]aving come to the conclusion that methods of medical treatment are not contemplated in the definition of \u201cinvention\u201d as a kind of \u201cprocess\u201d, the same must, on the same basis, be true of a method of surgical treatment.\u201d\n[21] The Supreme Court of Canada had occasion to comment on Tennessee Eastman in its later decision in Shell Oil Co. v. Commissioner of Patents, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 536, 142 D.L.R. (3d) 117 at 554 (Shell Oil):\nIn Tennessee Eastman Co. v. Commissioner of Patents (1970), 62 C.P.R. 117 (Ex. Ct.), aff\u2019d [1974] S.C.R. 111, the applicant sought a patent on a method of closing incisions following surgery by the use of an adhesive substance discovered to have a marked affinity for adhering to living tissue. The Commissioner refused the patent on the basis that this was not the kind of discovery (the adhesive itself not being new) which fell within the definition of \u201cinvention\u201d in the Act. In particular, he found that it was not an \u201cart\u201d because it was useful only in the process of surgical or medical treatment and produced no result in relation to trade, commerce or industry. The applicant appealed to the Exchequer Court and the issue there was limited to the question whether this use of the adhesive fell within the meaning of new and useful \u201cart\u201d or \u201cprocess\u201d within the meaning of the Patent Act. It was held that it did not for the reasons given by the Commissioner. In effect, it was not patentable because it was essentially non-economic and unrelated to trade, industry or commerce. It was related rather to the area of professional skills.\n[22] The explicit prohibition in subsection 41(1) of the Patent Act against patent claims to \u201csubstances prepared or produced by chemical processes and intended for food or medicine\u201d was later lifted by the repeal of this provision. However, that change did not have the effect of removing the prohibition on patenting methods of medical treatment. The Supreme Court of Canada effectively confirmed this in its comments on Tennessee Eastman in Apotex Inc. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd., 2002 SCC 77, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 153 at para. 49 (Wellcome), where it cited the explanation in Shell Oil that a claim to a method of medical treatment is unpatentable because it is \u201cessentially non-economic and unrelated to trade, industry, or commerce\u201d and \u201crelated rather to the area of professional skills\u201d.\n[23] Wellcome concerned a patent on the use of AZT as a treatment for HIV. The Court found that the patent did not concern a method of medical treatment, stating as follows at paragraph 50:\nThe AZT patent does not seek to \u201cfence in\u201d an area of medical treatment. It seeks the exclusive right to provide AZT as a commercial offering. How and when, if at all, AZT is employed is left to the professional skill and judgment of the medical profession.\n[24] Tennessee Eastman, Shell Oil, and Wellcome are Supreme Court of Canada decisions by which this Court is clearly bound. It is important to keep in mind what they say, and what they do not say. What they say is that a method of medical treatment is not patentable because it does not fall within the definition of \u201cinvention\u201d as contemplated in the Patent Act. This is because a method of medical treatment is unrelated to trade, industry or commerce, and concerns professional skills that are non-economic. A patent should not seek to fence in the exercise of such skills (including how and when a drug is administered), but it may cover a commercial offering.\n[25] The development of the jurisprudence beyond what is discussed in the foregoing Supreme Court decisions (what they do not say) is not equally binding on this Court, although this Court should follow its own decisions unless they are manifestly wrong: Miller v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 FCA 370, 220 DLR (4th) 149 at para. 10. I will now explore that jurisprudence and discuss the principles that properly arise therefrom.\n[26] The references to \u201ctrade, industry or commerce\u201d and \u201ccommercial offering\u201d by the Supreme Court appear to be the basis for the focus of many decisions on whether the invention concerns a \u201cvendible product\u201d: see Hospira at para. 53 as well as the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Wellcome ([2000] F.C.J. No. 1770, 10 C.P.R. (4th) 65 at para. 74). This focus is also discussed in the following Federal Court decisions: Merck & Co., Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2005 FC 755, 41 C.P.R. (4th) 35 at paras. 136\u201337; Merck & Co., Inc. v. Pharmascience Inc., 2010 FC 510, 85 C.P.R. (4th) 179 at paras. 110, 114 (Merck 2010); Janssen Inc. v. Mylan Pharmaceuticals ULC, 2010 FC 1123, 88 C.P.R. (4th) 359 at para. 53 (Mylan); Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. v. Cobalt Pharmaceuticals Company, 2013 FC 985 at paras. 78, 91, 98, aff\u2019d 2014 FCA 17, 236 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1001 (Novartis); Bayer at para. 162; Abbvie Biotechnology Ltd. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2014 FC 1251, 248 A.C.W.S. (3d) at paras. 115, 125 (Abbvie); and Biogen Canada Inc. v. Taro Pharmaceuticals Inc., 2020 FC 621, [2020] F.C.J. No. 611 at para. 211. The idea, with which I agree, is that a vendible product has economic value and is distinguishable from the skilled work of a physician, and hence outside the realm of methods of medical treatment as contemplated by the Supreme Court of Canada.\n[27] With regard to inventions relating to the administration of a drug, the jurisprudence at the Federal Court level has developed an approach whereby a claim may be found to be either patentable subject matter or an unpatentable method of medical treatment based on whether it defines a fixed dosage (or interval of administration) or a range of dosages (or intervals). This approach appears to have its origin in Axcan Pharma Inc. v. Pharmascience Inc., 2006 FC 527, 50 C.P.R. (4th) 321 at paragraphs 45\u201351 (Axcan), and was developed in Merck 2010 at paragraphs 111\u201314, and Novartis at paragraphs 82\u201399.\n[28] As indicated in the passage from Hospira quoted at paragraph 10 above, the distinction between fixed and variable dosages (or schedules) has a questionable underpinning, since such a distinction would seem to make no difference to whether the drug in question is a vendible product. However, the distinction makes more sense if one bears in mind the guidance noted in paragraph 6 above from Bayer that what matters is what the claims say; the product that the patentee puts on the market is incidental. In my view, it is permissible to focus on whether the dosing regimen is fixed or variable provided that the analysis remains tied to the ultimate question of whether professional skill is applied in using the invention. This was reflected in Mylan, which noted the concern in Axcan and Merck 2010 about dosage ranges, and then stated as follows at paragraph 26:\nWhat I take from the above authorities is that a patent claim over a method of medical treatment that, by its nature, covers an area for which a physician\u2019s skill or judgment is expected to be exercised is not patentable in Canada. This would include the administration of a drug whereby the physician, while relying upon the dosage advice of the patentee, would still be expected to be alert and responsive to a patient\u2019s profile and to the patient\u2019s reaction to the compound.\n[29] The Federal Court in Mylan at paragraph 4 noted that \u201cthe inventive concept of the [patent in suit] is limited to Janssen\u2019s claimed discovery that the slow titration of galantamine improved patient tolerability for the drug, by reducing side-effects and resulted in the ability to use a lower maintenance dose than had previously been shown to be effective.\u201d The Court found that the claims in issue concerned an unpatentable method of medical treatment because they defined a \u201ctitration regimen\u201d (see paragraph 50) that required the ongoing exercise of a physician\u2019s professional skill and judgment. The monopoly asserted by the claims would thereby interfere with the ability of a physician to exercise that skill and judgment.\n[30] Despite this, I think it would go too far to say that any drug regimen that requires a physician to monitor a patient is unpatentable. Such a prohibition would cast too wide a net, potentially encompassing almost any drug.\n[31] In Abbvie, the Federal Court provided a detailed review of the jurisprudence concerning methods of medical treatment. At paragraphs 110 and 121, the Court distinguished, properly in my view, between the exercise of skill and judgment in deciding whether to use a claimed invention (which does not indicate a method of medical treatment), and the exercise of skill and judgment in deciding how to use the invention (which is a prohibited method of medical treatment).\n[32] As in Mylan, Abbvie cautioned against a simple distinction between fixed and variable dosages and schedules. Paragraphs 112 to 114 stated as follows:\n[112] The respondent cautioned against relying on catch phrases rather than principles. In my view, the jurisprudence reflects that approach \u2013 the principle has been applied regardless of the Courts\u2019 references to \u201cfencing in\u201d or to \u201cfixed dosages\u201d. The issue in every case has been whether the patent claims a method of medical treatment. In applying the same principles, claims to fixed dosages and schedules which do not involve any professional decision-making have been accepted as patentable.\n[113] However, just because the claims involve a fixed dosage and schedule does not mean that they are automatically patentable, nor does it mean that they constitute unpatentable subject matter. The fixed dosage and schedule may be a good signal or starting point, but the evidence about that claimed dosage regime and schedule may indicate that it is not exactly as it is claimed and that adjustments are needed which requires skill and judgment.\n[114] The review of the relevant case law supports the appellants\u2019 understanding of the principles from the jurisprudence and demonstrates that the Courts have consistently found that a claim directed to the exercise of professional skill or judgment is not patentable. However, a claim which does not restrict, or interfere with, or otherwise engage professional skill or judgment \u2013 including a claim for a fixed dosage and or a fixed dosage schedule or interval \u2013 is not impermissible subject matter where there is no evidence to contradict that claimed dosage. Contrary to the Commissioner\u2019s decision and the respondent\u2019s position, [Mylan] has not changed the law.\n[33] Pharmascience argues that the concern in Abbvie about evidence that could contradict a fixed claimed dosage or schedule is directed to cases in which the dosage or schedule in question may not be effective for all patients such that a physician would have to exercise skill and judgment in some cases in determining an appropriate dosage. Pharmascience argues that a claimed dosage regimen that will not be appropriate for all patients constitutes an unpatentable method of medical treatment. As support for this argument, Pharmascience notes the following passage from Abbvie at paragraph 121:\nIn the present case, the physician\u2019s skill is not expected to be exercised within the claim. The prescribing practices are not restricted. The physician must exercise skill and judgment to determine if the claimed use is appropriate for the patient. The physician decides to prescribe it as is or not at all. If prescribed, there would be no restriction on the exercise of skill or judgment. The evidence is that this dosage with the bi-weekly interval is appropriate for all those to whom it is administered.\n[34] I do not understand Abbvie to exclude as prohibited methods of medical treatment all patent claims to a dosing regimen that may not work for all patients. Such a rigid approach would be inconsistent with the jurisprudence. In practice, I would expect that few drug regimens could be anticipated to be effective for all patients at a particular dosage. In my view, Abbvie was properly focused on whether it was expected that professional skill and judgment would be required in using the patented invention. In that case, the Court found no evidence to that effect (see paragraph 111).\n[35] The Federal Court reached the opposite result in Hoffmann-La Roche Limited v. Sandoz Canada Inc., 2021 FC 384, 185 C.P.R. (4th) 167 (Hoffmann). There, the Court found at paragraph 204 that \u201cthe evidence has established that there is a continued need for a physician\u2019s exercise of skill and judgement\u201d. Clearly, this issue is factually suffused; it depends on the evidence and it concerns how the patented invention is intended to be used.\n[36] Another possible wrinkle seems to arise in Novartis. In finding the claims of the patent in suit invalid, the Federal Court there noted at paragraph 99 that the claims included \u201ctreatment by intermittent dosages with some claims specifying a dosage range and others specifying specific dosages; and some claims claiming more frequent intervals of dosing, and others less\u201d. The Federal Court continued that the claims therefore included \u201cthat which lies within the skill of the medical practitioner\u201d. This reasoning suggests that the Court in Novartis may have been concerned that, even though some individual claims provided a fixed dosage and schedule, the claims of the patent taken together covered a range of possible dosages or schedules, such that use of the patented invention as claimed effectively required the exercise of skill and judgment. Though preceding paragraphs of that decision discussed variability in the frequency of the intermittent doses (in the disclosure portion of the patent), such variability within any particular claim is not discussed in paragraph 99.\n[37] To summarize, whether or not a patent claim to a dosing regimen relates to a method of medical treatment cannot be based exclusively on whether its dosing and schedule is fixed or not. The proper inquiry remains whether use of the invention (i.e., how to use it, not whether to use it) requires the exercise of skill and judgment, and the burden remains on the party challenging the patent. It is difficult to provide more detailed guidance than this for parties involved in future litigation and courts faced with allegations of invalidity of patent claims due to unpatentable subject matter, namely methods of medical treatment. Such allegations will generally turn on the particulars of the case and the evidence on the record.\nB. Issue 1: Whether claims 1 to 16 and 33 to 63 should have been subject to method of medical treatment analysis [38] At paragraph 34 of its reasons, the Federal Court divided the claims of the 335 Patent into four sets:\ni. Claims 1 to 16 relate to prefilled syringes adapted for administration according to the claimed dosing regimens;\nii. Claims 17 to 32 relate to a use of a \u201cdosage form\u201d according to the claimed dosing regimens;\niii. Claims 33 to 48 relate to use of paliperidone as paliperidone palmitate in the manufacture\/preparation of a \u201cmedicament\u201d adapted for administration according to the claimed dosing regimen; and\niv. Claims 49 to 63 relate to a \u201cdosage form\u201d adapted for administration according to the claimed dosage regimens.\n[39] At paragraph 163, the Federal Court found all of the claims except 17 to 32 (the other claims) to be product claims, and not methods of medical treatment.\n[40] Pharmascience argues that the Federal Court erred in concluding on this basis. It argues that the other claims do not concern a mere product (pre-filled syringes or a dosage form), but rather a dosing regimen involving ongoing maintenance dosing. Pharmascience argues that these claims should not have been excluded from the method of medical treatment analysis.\n[41] In my view, the Federal Court did not err in law in finding that the other claims did not define methods of medical treatment because they were product claims. It is not in dispute that a vendible product is not a method of medical treatment. Therefore, the issue is really whether the Federal Court erred in finding that the other claims are for a vendible product. In my view, a claim may concern a vendible product even if it includes a dosing regimen as an essential element.\n[42] The Federal Court specifically indicated its conclusions that the other claims are product claims at paragraphs 99, 109 and 111 of its reasons. I am not convinced that the Federal Court made any error in this regard. Claims 1 to 16 concern pre-filled syringes, which are clearly vendible products. Claims 33 to 48 concern the use of paliperidone, but in preparation of a medicament, which is also a vendible product. Finally, claims 49 to 63 concern a dosage form, which once again is a vendible product. I see no reason to interfere with the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that these are not claims to methods of medical treatment. I acknowledge Pharmascience\u2019s argument that it would be an error to focus on form over substance, but I see nothing in the substance of these claims that is inconsistent with their form as claims to vendible products.\n[43] I also do not accept Pharmascience\u2019s assertion that these claims were excluded from the method of medical treatment analysis. Even though the Federal Court suggests as much in paragraph 163 of its reasons, I am of the view that it did in fact consider these claims and it found that they related to a vendible product and were therefore patentable subject matter. In any case, the Federal Court\u2019s method of medical treatment analysis in relation to claims 17 to 32 of the 335 Patent would apply equally to the other claims.\nC. Issue 2: Whether the Federal Court erred in finding that the claims in issue are patentable on the basis of the dichotomy between fixed and variable dosing regimens [44] There are two aspects to Pharmascience\u2019s argument on this issue. First, Pharmascience argues that the Federal Court erred in describing the relevance of fixed or variable dosing regimens to the issue of method of medical treatment. Second, Pharmascience argues that the Federal Court erred in characterizing claims 17 to 32 of the 335 Patent as defining fixed dosages and schedules. I will address these two aspects separately.\n(1) Relevance of fixed or variable dosing [45] I have discussed the jurisprudence relevant to this aspect of issue 2 at paragraphs 27 to 37 above. In light of that discussion, the Federal Court\u2019s description of the law as it relates to fixed dosages and schedules at paragraph 164 of its reasons (see quote at paragraph 9 above) is incomplete. The question of patentable subject matter does not necessarily turn simply on whether the claim in question is limited to a fixed dosage and schedule. Rather, the proper question is whether professional skill and judgment would be required in using the patented invention. Though a fixed dosage and schedule may be a good indication that no such skill and judgment would be required, evidence may indicate otherwise.\n[46] Pharmascience also draws the Court\u2019s attention to paragraph 167 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons:\nAs Pharmascience\u2019s expert Dr. Jeffries agreed, claims 17-32 do not prevent physicians from practicing in a manner they had previously \u201cbecause they weren\u2019t doing anything before\u201d the 335 Patent with paliperidone palmitate to treat schizophrenia.\n[47] I am inclined to agree with Pharmascience that this observation may be relevant to the issue of obviousness, but it is not relevant to whether the claims in question define patentable subject matter.\n[48] Despite this, I do not see either paragraph 164 or 167 as representing a reviewable error. I read paragraph 167 as an aside that was unnecessary to the Federal Court\u2019s decision. With regard to paragraph 164 and the Federal Court\u2019s failure to acknowledge the potential relevance of evidence that contradicts the fixed nature of the claimed dosing and schedule, I am satisfied that it made no difference to the result. Firstly, the same judge (Justice Manson) was aware of this precise issue, having considered it just the year before in Hoffmann at paragraph 202. Secondly, as discussed below in relation to the second aspect of this issue, Pharmascience has not convinced me that any evidence on the record was sufficient to contradict the fixed nature of the dosing and schedule claimed in the 335 Patent. It would have been preferable for the Federal Court to have acknowledged this nuance in the legal test, but I do not see this omission as a reviewable error.\n[49] At paragraphs 168 to 171 of its reasons, the Federal Court properly focused on whether use of the claims required the exercise of skill and judgment. At paragraph 171, the Federal Court properly recognized the distinction between the exercise of skill and judgment in deciding whether to use the invention, and the exercise of skill and judgment in deciding how to use the invention.\n(2) Characterization of claims 17 to 32 as defining fixed dosages and schedules [50] Pharmascience points to paragraph 162 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons as an acknowledgement that different dosages may be required for different patients, and therefore the 335 Patent does not define a fixed dosage regimen. Pharmascience argues that the patented regimen is not \u201cone size fits all\u201d, and therefore it constitutes a method of medical treatment. As indicated above in discussion of Abbvie, I do not accept the fact that a fixed dosage may not work for some patients as sufficient to conclude that the invention is an unpatentable method of medical treatment. As indicated several times already in these reasons, the proper question is whether skill and judgment is required to use the invention.\n[51] Pharmascience also cites various elements of the claims of the 335 Patent as instances of variability in dosing and scheduling that require a conclusion that the invention is not limited to a fixed dosage and schedule. One example is the window provided in claims 17 to 32 for the second loading dose (\u201cone week \u00b1 2 days after the first loading dose\u201d) and for the maintenance doses (\u201cmonthly \u00b1 7 days dosing interval after the second loading dose\u201d). Pharmascience argues that the claims therefore effectively call for the second dose in a range from day 6 to day 10, and the maintenance dose in a range from 23 to 37 days after the second dose.\n[52] The Federal Court acknowledged this argument at paragraph 170 of its reasons, but found that these choices have no clinical implications, and are there to allow flexibility in administering the drug. The Court concluded based on this that the claims do not interfere with a physician\u2019s exercise of skill and judgment. I see no legal error here, and Pharmascience does not assert any palpable and overriding error of fact or of mixed fact and law. In Wellcome, claims that defined the intended dosage as \u201can effective amount\u201d were held to be patentable subject matter despite the fact that they clearly contemplated some variability.\n[53] Pharmascience makes a similar argument regarding flexibility as to the location for injection of the monthly maintenance dose, which may be in \u201ca deltoid or a gluteal muscle\u201d. The Federal Court reached the same conclusion, which was open to it, that this choice has no clinical implications and does not interfere with a physician\u2019s exercise of skill and judgment.\n[54] Pharmascience also argues that the disclosure portion of the 335 Patent indicates that physicians are intended to exercise skill and judgment in using the invention. It points specifically to the following passage at page 12, lines 23 to 25 thereof:\nThose of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the maintenance dose may be titrated up or down in view of patients condition (response to the medication and renal function).\n[55] Titration has been cited in the jurisprudence as a basis for concluding that use of an invention requires skill and judgment: see Mylan and Hoffmann. But in my view, this sentence is insufficient to find a reviewable error in this case. While the Federal Court was required to consider the implications of this sentence as part of its review of the 335 Patent as a whole, it is not of such a nature as to require the Federal Court to conclude that use of the claimed invention demands the exercise of skill and judgment. Once again, I see no legal error here, and Pharmascience does not assert any palpable and overriding error of fact or of mixed fact and law.\n[56] Another potential argument of variability in the 335 Patent is the difference between dosing for patients with renal impairment and dosing for those without. However, it appears that this is an objective distinction that does not involve the exercise of a physician\u2019s skill and judgment. Rather, it reflects the fact that a different intended dosage regimen applies for patients with renal impairment.\nD. Scope of injunction [57] A final issue that was raised as an alternative argument in Pharmascience\u2019s memorandum of fact and law concerns the scope of the injunction that was granted by the Federal Court in its judgment. This issue was not addressed orally at the hearing of this appeal, but it also was not given up.\n[58] Pharmascience argues that the injunction is too broad, in that it covers activities that are outside the scope of the exclusive rights for a patent enumerated in section 42 of the Patent Act, namely the right to make, construct, use and sell the invention.\n[59] The injunction granted by the Federal Court appears in paragraph 4 of its judgment:\nAn injunction is granted until the expiry of the 335 Patent on December 17, 2028, restraining Pharmascience, as well as its subsidiary and affiliated companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, licensees, successors, assigns, and any others over whom it exercises lawful authority, from:\nMaking, constructing, using or selling pms-PALIPERIDONE PALMITATE in Canada in accordance with ANDS Nos. 244641 and 251767;\nOffering for sale, marketing or having pms-PALIPERIDONE PALMITATE marketed in Canada in accordance with ANDS No. 244641 and 251767; and\nImporting, exporting, distributing or having pms-PALIPERIDONE PALMITATE distributed in Canada in accordance with ANDS Nos. 244641 and 251767.\n[60] Pharmascience effectively takes issue with the following activities being included in the injunction: (i) offering for sale, (ii) marketing, (iii) having marketed, (iv) importing, (v) exporting, (vi) distributing, and (vii) having distributed.\n[61] Pharmascience has provided little by way of explanation as to how these activities are supposed to fall outside the scope of a patentee\u2019s exclusive rights. I note that an injunction of similar scope was recently granted by this Court against Apotex Inc. in a parallel action involving Janssen and the 335 Patent (Janssen Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2023 FCA 253). Paragraphs 64 to 70 of that decision explain the reasoning for granting an injunction of that scope.\n[62] I note also, as does Janssen, that Pharmascience did not raise this issue in its notice of appeal.\n[63] I would reject Pharmascience\u2019s alternative argument concerning the scope of the injunction both because it was not raised in the notice of appeal, and for the reasons discussed in paragraphs 64 to 70 of the decision mentioned in paragraph 61 above.\nVI. Conclusion [64] It follows from the foregoing that I would dismiss the present appeal. I would award costs to Janssen in the agreed amount of $10,000, all-inclusive.\n\"George R.

His Majesty the King (Docket No. 2018-917(IT)G) (per Biringer J., as she then was). The decision upheld an assessment issued to Ms. Pillon pursuant to s. 160(1) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.1 (5th Supp.) (the Act). In this appeal, Ms. Pillon submits that the Tax Court made several errors that warrant our intervention.\n[2] By way of background, s. 160(1) is a tax collection measure. It concerns a situation in which a person with an outstanding tax liability transfers property to another person without receiving adequate consideration. If they were not dealing at arm\u2019s length, the person who received the property, the transferee, is liable for the transferor\u2019s outstanding tax liability up to the net amount received.\n[3] In making the assessment issued to Ms. Pillon, the Minister of National Revenue alleged that Ms. Pillon was a transferee who received property from Mr. John Wall, who had outstanding tax liabilities. In 2009 and 2010, Ms. Pillon purportedly received amounts from Mr. Wall totalling $978,900 at a time when he owed over twice that amount under the Act.\n[4] The assessment was appealed to the Tax Court. In that appeal, Ms. Pillon submitted that s. 160(1) did not apply\u2014 first because she gave full consideration for the property received; and second because she dealt at arm\u2019s length with Mr. Wall. Ms. Pillon\u2019s oral evidence in support of these submissions was limited to her own testimony and that of her tax accountant. Mr. Wall did not testify.\n[5] The trial judge was not persuaded by either of these submissions.\n[6] With respect to the consideration paid, Ms. Pillon testified in the Tax Court that she had given full consideration because the transfers were simply repayments of loans that she had made to Mr. Wall. The trial judge rejected this testimony on the grounds that it was not credible. Accordingly, the Court concluded that no loans were made.\n[7] With respect to the non-arm\u2019s length requirement, the issue was whether Ms. Pillon and Mr. Wall were spouses or common-law partners, or whether they were otherwise not dealing at arm\u2019s length. The trial judge determined that they were not spouses or common-law partners, but they otherwise did not deal at arm\u2019s length.\n[8] To determine the non-arm\u2019s length issue, the trial judge applied the legal principles articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada v. McLarty, 2008 SCC 79. She found that Ms. Pillon and Mr. Wall were not dealing at arm\u2019s length because they acted in concert without separate interests. In making this finding, the Court noted that Ms. Pillon or Mr. Wall had signed various documents which indicated that they were: \u201cpartners, common law, husband and wife, reflected a common address, and had also a financial relationship between them.\u201d The trial judge concluded that they had a close personal relationship.\n[9] The Tax Court also considered the evidence concerning Ms. Pillon\u2019s purported loans to Mr. Wall, stating that this might potentially bear on the non-arm\u2019s length issue. The trial judge reached the conclusion that the terms and conditions of the alleged loans did not reflect \u201cordinary commercial dealings between parties acting in their own interests.\u201d\n[10] Based on this and other factors, the Tax Court concluded that s. 160(1) applied.\n[11] In this Court, Ms. Pillon submits that the Tax Court made several errors that concern both issues which warrant our intervention.\n[12] We are of the view that the Tax Court made no such errors. Although the decision was rendered orally, the reasons were detailed and thorough. There was ample support for the conclusions that were reached. In applying the relevant standards of appellate review, we conclude that the correct legal principles were applied by the Tax Court and there was no palpable and overriding error of fact or mixed fact and law.\n[13] Most of Ms. Pillon\u2019s submissions in this Court misinterpret the Tax Court\u2019s decision and are devoid of merit. We would mention two of the submissions in particular.\n[14] At this hearing, Ms. Pillon submitted that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in characterizing the evidence. She submits that she and Mr. Wall acted in their own separate interests and did not act with one single mind.\n[15] We disagree with this submission. The trial judge\u2019s conclusion that there was an absence of separate interests was well supported by the evidence. This was far from a palpable and overriding error.\n[16] The second submission we will mention relates to a finding by the trial judge that there likely would have been a clearer picture of events if Mr. Wall had testified. Ms. Pillon submitted that, because of this finding, it was an error for the Court to decide against her.\n[17] We disagree with this because it fails to take into account that Ms. Pillon had the burden of proof. The Tax Court made this clear and noted that it was Ms. Pillon\u2019s choice to have only herself and her tax accountant testify. Ultimately, the Court concluded that the burden of proof was not satisfied. Therefore, it was not an error to find against Ms. Pillon in circumstances where Mr. Wall did not testify.\n[18] In the result, we are in agreement that the appeal should be dismissed, with costs to the respondent.\n\u201cJudith Woods\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-61-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMARIA PILLON v.

The two are identical, there being no confidential information disclosed in the confidential reasons.\nWEBB J.A.\n[1] Remington Sales Co. d.b.a. Hyundai Heavy Industries (Canada) (Remington) (Appeal EA-2019-009) appealed the re-determination of anti-dumping duties made by the President of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT). Hyundai Canada Inc. (HCI) (Appeals EA-2019-008 and EA-2019-010) also appealed this re-determination to the CITT.\n[2] At the parties\u2019 request, the appeals before the CITT were combined. Although two sets of reasons were issued, the reasons rendered by the CITT in the HCI appeal were adopted in the reasons issued for the Remington appeal.\n[3] The President of the CBSA (President) formed the opinion that the export price under section 24 of the Special Import Measures Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-15 (SIMA) was unreliable based on a reliability test that compared the section 24 export price to the section 25 export price. The CITT found that the President\u2019s opinion should not have been solely based on the reliability test that was used but rather on a number of factors enumerated by the CITT. The CITT decided that the matter was to be remanded to the President for reconsideration.\n[4] Both Remington and HCI filed an appeal to this Court. However, HCI filed a notice of discontinuance of its appeal. Prior to HCI filing its notice of discontinuance, the respondents (the President and Hitachi Energy Canada Inc. (Hitachi)) each filed notices of cross-appeal in relation to Remington\u2019s appeal and HCI\u2019s appeal.\n[5] As a result, Remington\u2019s appeal and the cross-appeals of the President and Hitachi to Remington\u2019s appeal and HCI\u2019s appeal proceeded to hearing in this Court. The appeal and the cross-appeals were consolidated by the Order of this Court dated November 24, 2022, with the appeal A-162-22 being designated as the lead appeal. These reasons will be filed in A-162-22 and a copy thereof will be filed in A-163-22.\n[6] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss Remington\u2019s appeal and allow the cross-appeals of the President and Hitachi. The statutory references herein are to the various sections, subsections and paragraphs of SIMA, unless otherwise noted.\nI. Background [7] Goods imported into Canada are \u201cdumped\u201d (as defined in subsection 2(1)) when the normal value of the goods exceeds the export price of such goods. The margin of dumping is defined in subsection 2(1) as the difference between these two amounts. The normal value is determined in accordance with sections 15 to 23.1 and 30 and the export price is determined in accordance with sections 24 to 28 and 30. If the normal value or export price cannot be determined in accordance with these provisions, such amount is determined in the manner specified by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (section 29).\n[8] In this appeal, the relevant provisions are sections 24 and 25 of SIMA. The full English and French versions of these sections are set out in the Appendix attached to these reasons.\n[9] Under section 24, the export price is the lesser of the exporter\u2019s sale price for the goods (subject to certain adjustments) and the price that the importer has paid or agreed to pay for the goods (subject to certain adjustments).\n[10] Section 25 provides, in part:\n25 (1) Where, in respect of goods sold to an importer in Canada,\n\u2026\n(b) the President is of the opinion that the export price, as determined under section 24, is unreliable\n(i) by reason that the sale of the goods for export to Canada was a sale between associated persons,\n[the export price is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 25].\n[11] The President made a final determination of dumping on October 22, 2012. The determination was made with respect to \u201cliquid dielectric transformers (power transformers) having a top power handling capacity equal to or exceeding 60,000 kilovolt amperes (60 megavolt amperes), whether assembled or unassembled, complete or incomplete, originating in or exported from Korea\u201d (paragraph 5 of the reasons of the CITT in both appeals).\n[12] The CITT made a finding that the dumping had caused injury to the domestic industry on November 20, 2012.\n[13] In 2018, the CBSA initiated a review of the normal values and export prices applicable to power transformers exported from Korea to Canada by Hyundai Electric & Energy Systems (Hyundai Electric). The period of investigation for this review was from November 1, 2016, to October 31, 2018.\n[14] In conducting this review, the CBSA determined that Remington imported transformers produced by Hyundai Electric and that Remington and Hyundai Electric were associated for the purposes of SIMA. The President, based on a reliability test conducted by the CBSA that calculated export prices under section 25, formed the opinion that the export prices determined under section 24 were not reliable. Therefore, the export prices were determined in accordance with the provisions of section 25.\n[15] The export prices determined under section 25 resulted in retroactive assessments of anti-dumping duties.\n[16] Remington and HCI each appealed the re-determination made by the President of the amount of the anti-dumping duties, and in particular the determination of the export price by the President, to the CITT.\nII. Decision of the CITT [17] The hearing before the CITT was an appeal de novo. The CITT addressed the arguments of HCI fully in its reasons issued in HCI\u2019s appeals and then incorporated by reference these reasons in its decision in Remington\u2019s appeal. Therefore, even though HCI has discontinued its appeal to this Court, to understand the reasoning of the CITT it is necessary to refer to the reasons issued by the CITT in HCI\u2019s appeals. The references herein to particular paragraphs in the CITT\u2019s reasons are references to the paragraphs in the reasons issued in the HCI appeals, unless otherwise indicated.\n[18] The issues raised by Remington and HCI all related to the determination of the export price. In particular, they questioned whether a reliability test based on calculating the export price under section 25 was an appropriate basis for the President to form an opinion on whether the export price determined under section 24 was reliable. Remington and HCI also challenged certain deductions that the President made in determining the export price.\n[19] The CITT described the reliability test conducted by the President in paragraph 23:\n\u2026 To perform the reliability test, the CBSA will select a representative sample of transactions and perform the export price calculation using the methodology of section 24 and then using the methodology of section 25 and compare the two results. If the section 25 export price is equal to or greater than the section 24 export price in 80 percent or more of the sample transactions, measured by volume or value as appropriate, then the section 24 export price will normally be considered reliable. Conversely, if the section 25 export price is lower than the section 24 export price in more than 20 percent of the sample transactions, then the section 24 export price will usually be considered unreliable, and section 25 will be used to determine export prices for that exporter.\n[20] The CITT noted, in paragraph 24 of its reasons, that \u201c[t]he aim of the calculations under both sections 24 and 25 is to arrive at an ex-factory price for the goods\u201d.\n[21] The CITT concluded that the President erred in only performing a mathematical computation to assess whether the export price under section 24 was reliable:\n[80] Further, a determination of reliability that is focused exclusively on a mathematical formula comparing section 24 and section 25 export prices, with the objective of determining what should have been the appropriate level of profit realized on the importer\u2019s resale of the goods, falls short of what would constitute an appropriate consideration of relevant factors that determine the reliability of the section 24 export price.\n[22] In paragraph 85, the CITT set out what, in its view, must be considered by the President in forming an opinion on the reliability of the section 24 export price:\nA proper reliability test must examine the section 24 export price in terms of its character or quality. It must assess reliability on the basis of all relevant factors such as the general and specific economic commercial conditions that existed at the time of the transaction, the consistency and accuracy of financial books and records that normally reveal the financial situation of the parties to the transaction, the particular nature of the goods that are the subject of trade, and the commercial context in which the transaction is completed. The reliability test must address the specific mischief which is to be prevented such as manipulation of the prices, etc.\n[23] Since the test used by the President did not assess the \u201ccharacter and quality of the section 24 export price\u201d but rather \u201conly compared two sets of prices \u2014 the section 24 export price and the section 25 export price\u201d (paragraph 86) \u2014 the CITT remanded the matter to the President for reconsideration of whether the section 24 export price was unreliable.\n[24] The CITT then addressed HCI\u2019s arguments concerning the amounts deducted in computing the export price. In particular, HCI submitted that for the purposes of paragraph 25(1)(d), \u201cthe price of the goods as assembled\u201d is the total contract price for the goods and any related services that are to be provided under the contract. The costs, charges or expenses for the services would then be deducted under subparagraphs 25(1)(d)(ii) to (v).\n[25] The CITT found that since SIMA is focused on the dumping of goods, the President did not err in excluding the amounts to be paid for any services that were separately identified in the contract for the sale of the transformers. Since the price for the goods used by the President did not include any amounts payable for such services, no further deduction would be made under subparagraphs 25(1)(d)(ii) to (v) in relation to such services.\n[26] In the reasons related to Remington\u2019s appeal, the CITT summarized its findings with respect to the other deductions that were in issue in relation to the re-determination of the export prices:\n[50] For the same reasons given in EA-2019-008 and EA-2019-010 [HCI\u2019s appeals], the Tribunal also makes several findings regarding the deductions made in re-determining export prices under sections 24 and 25 of SIMA:\n\u2026\n(b) The Tribunal finds that, as the amount of profit is not being challenged, its deduction cannot be an issue, regardless of whether there are amounts regarding profit on services in the profit calculation.\n(c) The Tribunal finds that it is not convinced that the evidence shows that the CBSA engaged in the practice of selecting the higher of service expenses or revenues for the purpose of reducing the section 25 export prices.\n(d) The Tribunal finds that the CBSA correctly deducted third-party expenses for the purpose of arriving at the ex-factory price.\n(e) For reasons of judicial economy, the Tribunal will not address whether paragraph 25(1)(c) should be applied rather than paragraph 25(1)(d). Nothing turns on the outcome of this question in the context of this proceeding.\n[27] The CITT also found that there was no support in SIMA for \u201cRemington\u2019s submission that a specific item that was unforeseen is extraneous and should not have been deducted in the section 25 calculation\u201d (paragraph 51 of the reasons related to Remington\u2019s appeal).\nIII. Issues and Standard of Review [28] Section 62 restricts any appeal to this Court to only questions of law. No appeal lies to this Court on any question of fact or mixed fact and law (unless there is an extricable question of law). Since appeals are restricted to questions of law, the standard of review is correctness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, at para. 37).\n[29] Remington raises three issues in this appeal:\n(a)whether the CITT erred in law in remanding the matter to the President for re-determination;\n(b)whether the CITT erred in law in its interpretation of paragraph 25(1)(d); and\n(c)whether the CITT made incorrect findings of fact in relation to paragraph 25(1)(d) that would constitute errors of law.\n[30] The issues related to the interpretation of paragraph 25(1)(d) and the factual findings in relation to this paragraph will be addressed together.\n[31] In the cross-appeals the issue is whether the CITT erred in determining that the reliability test adopted by the President could not be used to determine the reliability of the section 24 export price.\nIV. Analysis [32] The issues arising in the appeal will be addressed first and then the issue in the cross-appeal will be addressed.\nA. Decision to remand the matter to the President [33] Remington can only succeed with respect to this issue if, as a matter of law, the CITT was required to decide whether the section 24 export price was unreliable and to then determine the export price under section 24 (if the CITT determined that the export price under that section was reliable) or under section 25 (if the CITT determined that the section 24 export price was unreliable).\n[34] Remington, in its argument, emphasized the following statement found at paragraph 89 of the CITT\u2019s reasons:\n[89] However, the Tribunal does not know what the CBSA considered in its decision. Therefore, in these circumstances, the Tribunal must remand this decision back to the CBSA for a reconsideration on the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s reasons.\n[35] Although the reference is to what the CBSA considered in its decision, since the decision in issue is the opinion of the President concerning whether the section 24 export price was reliable, this reference should be read as referring to what the President considered. Remington\u2019s argument is that the CITT did know what the President considered.\n[36] The evidence confirmed that the President relied on the reliability test as described above. The CITT, in its reasons at paragraph 80, found that \u201ca determination of reliability that is focused exclusively on a mathematical formula comparing section 24 and section 25 export prices\u201d was not appropriate. The CITT also noted at paragraph 83 that although the CBSA\u2019s policy indicates that other factors may be relevant in determining the reliability of a section 24 export price, \u201cthere is no evidence that such other factors were taken into account by the President in this case\u201d.\n[37] Remington points to such statements to indicate that the CITT misspoke when it stated that it did \u201cnot know what the CBSA considered in its decision\u201d. However, in my view, this statement must be read in context. The CITT was aware that the President relied on the reliability test described above in forming the opinion of unreliability. The CITT rejected the sole reliance on this mathematical comparison and set out a number of factors that must be considered by the President. Having made these findings, the error made by the CITT in paragraph 89 was simply misstating its rationale for remanding the matter to the President. Having set out a number of factors that the President did not consider, the CITT would not know whether the President (whose opinion is the relevant opinion under section 25) would form the same opinion on reliability once the factors set out in paragraph 85 were considered.\n[38] Subsection 61(3) provides that the CITT may make such order as may be required \u2014 it does not obligate the CITT to make any specific order or finding:\n(3) On any appeal under subsection (1) or (1.1), the Tribunal may make such order or finding as the nature of the matter may require and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may declare what duty is payable or that no duty is payable on the goods with respect to which the appeal was taken, and an order, finding or declaration of the Tribunal is final and conclusive subject to further appeal as provided in section 62.\n(3) Le Tribunal, saisi d\u2019un appel en vertu des paragraphes (1) ou (1.1), peut rendre les ordonnances ou conclusions indiqu\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et, notamment, d\u00e9clarer soit quels droits sont payables, soit qu\u2019aucun droit n\u2019est payable sur les marchandises vis\u00e9es par l\u2019appel. Les ordonnances, conclusions et d\u00e9clarations du Tribunal sont d\u00e9finitives, sauf recours pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 62.\n[39] Whether the circumstances of a particular case would warrant remanding a matter to the President is a question of fact or mixed fact and law and cannot be appealed to this Court. Having found that there were a number of factors that, in the CITT\u2019s view, the President should have considered in rendering the reliability opinion, it was not an error of law for the CITT to remand the matter to the President. Remington cannot succeed on this ground of appeal.\nB. Interpretation of paragraph 25(1)(d) and the factual findings related thereto [40] In paragraph 93 of its reasons, the CITT noted \u201c[t]he basic purpose of SIMA is to address the dumping of goods. It is not intended to address the dumping of services\u201d (emphasis added by the CITT).\n[41] Remington, in its memorandum at paragraph 100, confirms that the ultimate determination is the export price of the goods: \u201c[i]t is obvious that the value of services must be eliminated to determine the export price of the goods.\u201d\n[42] The dispute is how the amount for services is eliminated. In calculating the export price, the CBSA would first determine if the contract specified a separate amount for services. For contracts where the price for the particular goods is set out and an additional amount for services that do not contribute to the value of the goods is also specified, the amount for the goods used by the CBSA, before any deductions contemplated by subparagraphs 25(1)(d)(ii) to (v) were made, was the price identified for the goods; i.e. the amount specified for the services was not included. No amount was deducted under subparagraphs 25(1)(d)(ii) to (v) in relation to these services, as the contract price for these services was not included as part of the price of the goods.\n[43] Remington\u2019s position is that the starting amount should have been the full contract price and then the amounts for the services should have been deducted under subparagraphs 25(1)(d)(ii) to (v).\n[44] Since the parties acknowledged that freight was one such service and that the provision of this service was not confidential, a simple example using freight as the service will illustrate the difference between the two positions.\n[45] Assume that the total contract price is $1,200 and that contract specifies that $1,000 is for particular goods and $200 is for the freight.\n[46] For the purposes of determining the section 25 export price, the CBSA would have used $1,000 as the price for the goods. In this simple example, there would be no further deductions under section 25 and the export price would be $1,000.\n[47] Remington\u2019s position is that the price (before considering the section 25 deductions) should have been $1,200. The freight would then be deducted as required by subparagraphs 25(1)(d)(ii) to (v). If the deduction required for freight would also be $200, then there would no difference in the export price \u2014 it would still be $1,000. However, if the cost of the freight incurred by the exporter was only $150 (which would mean that the exporter marked up the cost of the freight to $200), Remington submitted that the amount to be deducted under subparagraph 25(1)(d)(ii) to (v) would only be $150.\n[48] However, since SIMA is focused on determining whether particular goods are being dumped and the amount of anti-dumping duties to be imposed if goods are dumped, it is far from clear why the export price should reflect an amount for profit realized on a sale of services that do not contribute to the value of the goods. The focus is on the goods, not the services, as acknowledged by the CITT and Remington.\n[49] In this case the CITT made the following findings with respect to the services, the amount payable for which was excluded in determining the starting price for the goods:\n[96] Therefore, the value of services that are a separate and distinct object of trade and do not contribute to the value of the subject good should not be included in the \u201cprice for which the goods were sold\u201d. It would be an error for the CBSA to include the price of services in its calculations where it is not demonstrated that those services were part of the same transaction as that of the transformer and that their value contributes to the value of the subject goods themselves. The prices of those services were set out separately from the prices of the goods and the evidence establishes no connection between the value of the imported transformers themselves and the value of the services that were excluded by the CBSA at the outset of the calculation. In all appearances, those services were distinct and were not part of the consideration when the price of the transformers was set.\n[50] The findings that the prices for the services were set out separately from the prices for the goods and that there was no connection between these services and the value of the goods were findings of fact. Remington argues that these findings of fact are errors of law.\n[51] In Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc., [1997] 1 SCR 748, 1997 CanLII 385 (SCC), the Supreme Court of Canada stated:\n[41] \u2026 If the Tribunal did ignore items of evidence that the law requires it to consider, then the Tribunal erred in law. Similarly, if the Tribunal considered all the mandatory kinds of evidence but still reached the wrong conclusion, then its error was one of mixed law and fact. ...\n[52] In R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45 the Supreme Court noted:\n[25] It has long been recognized that it is an error of law to make a finding of fact for which there is no supporting evidence: Schuldt v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 592, at p. 604.\n[53] In Murphy v Saskatchewan Government Insurance, 2008 SKCA 57, at para. 5, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal also noted that a finding of fact will be an error of law if it \u201c\u2026 (b) is made on the basis of irrelevant evidence or in disregard of relevant evidence; or, (c) is based on an irrational inference of fact\u201d.\n[54] The CITT reviewed the contracts and the services provided and made the factual findings as set out in paragraph 49 above. There was supporting evidence for these findings and there is no indication that the CITT based these findings on irrelevant evidence or by disregarding relevant evidence or on an irrational inference of fact. To the extent that these findings were based on the interpretation of the contracts, as noted by the Supreme Court in Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp., 2014 SCC 53, at para. 50, the interpretation of contracts is a question of mixed fact and law. Remington has not established that the CITT made any errors of fact that would be errors of law.\n[55] Remington also argued that the CITT erred in not finding that the President used the higher of the expense and revenue for a certain service. The CITT reviewed the evidence and found that it was \u201cnot convinced that the evidence shows that the CBSA engaged in the practice of selecting the higher of service expenses or revenues for the purpose of reducing the section 25 export prices\u201d (paragraph 50 (c) of the CITT\u2019s reasons related to Remington\u2019s appeal). This finding of fact does not rise to the level of an error of law.\n[56] With respect to the interpretation of paragraph 25(1)(d), Remington submitted that the CITT erred in referring to \u201cthe price for which the goods were sold\u201d in paragraphs 95 and 96 and footnote 31 of its reasons. Paragraph 25(1)(d) refers to \u201cthe price of the goods as assembled\u201d. Paragraph 25(1)(c) refers to the \u201cthe price for which the goods were so sold\u201d.\n[57] In the appeal before the CITT, there was an issue concerning whether paragraph 25(1)(c) (which applies to goods sold in the condition in which they are imported) or paragraph 25(1)(d) (which applies to goods imported for the purpose of assembly) was applicable to the importations in issue.\n[58] The CITT, in paragraph 105 of its reasons, noted:\n[105] [ABB Power Grids Canada Inc. \u2013 now Hitachi Energy Canada Inc.] submits that paragraph 25(1)(c) should be applied rather than paragraph 25(1)(d), because the goods were sold \u201cin the condition in which they were or are to be imported\u201d (i.e. unassembled) rather than \u201cfor the purpose of assembly\u201d. However, all parties agreed that it would make no difference to the outcome of the calculation.\n[59] Remington, in its memorandum, only acknowledges that the CITT declined to resolve the issue of whether paragraph 25(1)(c) or paragraph 25(1)(d) was applicable. Remington does not otherwise address this paragraph from the CITT reasons, and in particular, does not take issue with the statement that the parties had agreed that the outcome of the calculation would be the same. Since Remington acknowledged at the appeal before the CITT that the same export price would be determined whether paragraph 25(1)(c) or paragraph 25(1)(d) applied, there would be no difference in determining \u201cthe price for which the goods were sold\u201d and the \u201cthe price of the goods as assembled\u201d in this case. Remington is, in effect, acknowledging that for its argument, it is not significant whether the starting point is \u201cthe price for which the goods were sold\u201d or \u201cthe price of the goods as assembled\u201d. If this would have been significant then the outcome of the calculation would not necessarily be the same.\n[60] As a result, even though the correct expression to use when referring to paragraph 25(1)(d) is \u201cthe price of the goods as assembled\u201d, nothing turns on the CITT\u2019s use of the expression \u201cthe price for which the goods were sold\u201d.\n[61] The CITT did not err in interpreting section 25 as allowing the CBSA to use the identified price for the particular goods as the price of the goods excluding any amount specifically identified in the contract as an amount payable for services that did not contribute to the value of the goods. The CITT also did not make any factual findings that would be an error of law.\n[62] In my view, Remington cannot succeed on this ground of appeal.\nC. Conclusion on Remington\u2019s Appeal [63] As a result, I would dismiss Remington\u2019s appeal, with costs.\nD. Cross-Appeal [64] The cross-appeal also challenges the decision of the CITT to remand the matter to the President, albeit for different reasons than submitted by Remington.\n[65] Section 25 provides, in part, that if the President is of the opinion that the export price, as determined under section 24, is unreliable by reason that the exporter and the importer are associated persons for the purposes of SIMA, the export price is to be determined as set out in section 25.\n[66] The CITT rejected the President\u2019s use of the provisions of section 25 to calculate an export price to be compared to the section 24 export price (the amount paid, subject to certain adjustments) to test the reliability of the section 24 price. In essence, the President was using section 25 (which is triggered once the President forms the opinion that the section 24 export price is unreliable) as a basis to form an opinion concerning the reliability of the section 24 export price. This dual role for section 25 (to assist in making the required opinion and to then calculate the export price that will be used, if the opinion is that the section 24 export price is unreliable) was acknowledged by the CBSA at the hearing of this appeal.\n[67] The issue is whether it was an error of law for the CITT to reject this dual role for section 25 and impose mandatory factors that the President must consider in making the required reliability opinion.\n[68] In my view, this was an error of law.\n[69] In paragraph 80 of its reasons, the CITT takes exception to the exclusive use of a mathematical formula comparing section 24 and section 25 export prices. However, SIMA is a numbers based statute. The definition of \u201cdumped\u201d in subsection 2(1) incorporates a comparison of two amounts:\ndumped, in relation to any goods, means that the normal value of the goods exceeds the export price thereof;\nsous-\u00e9valu\u00e9 Qualificatif de marchandises dont la valeur normale est sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 leur prix \u00e0 l\u2019exportation.\n[70] Normal value is defined in subsection 2(1):\n\u201cnormal value\u201d means normal value determined in accordance with sections 15 to 23 and 29 and 30;\nvaleur normale La valeur \u00e9tablie conform\u00e9ment aux articles 15 \u00e0 23, 29 et 30.\n[71] The normal value of goods is to be determined based on the price of like goods that are sold to the persons identified in paragraph 15(a) and in the circumstances as set out in paragraphs 15(b) to (e), subject to certain adjustments. If there are insufficient qualifying sales of like goods, the normal value, subject to section 20, is determined either by using the price at which like goods are sold to other countries or by using the cost of production and adding a reasonable amount for administrative, selling and all other costs and a reasonable amount for profits (section 19).\n[72] The normal value is, therefore, an amount that will require some computation.\n[73] Likewise, export price is an amount that, whether section 24 or 25 is used, will require some computation.\n[74] To determine whether a particular amount is reliable, it would be logical to compare that amount to an amount that is reliable. As noted by the CBSA, Parliament has specified that when the section 24 amount is unreliable, the export price is to be determined under section 25. This would mean that an export price determined under section 25 would be considered reliable. Parliament would not have intended that one unreliable price be replaced by another unreliable price.\n[75] The President chose to use an export price calculated under section 25 as a basis to test the reliability of the section 24 export price. Section 25 stipulates that it is the President\u2019s opinion that is relevant. There are no stipulated guidelines or factors that the President must consider. Therefore, the President has a broad discretion.\n[76] The purpose of SIMA is to determine if goods are being dumped into Canada and if so to impose anti-dumping duties. The duties imposed are determined by a formula (subsection 3(1) and section 30.2). In my view, given the context and purpose of the statutory scheme, the CITT erred in interpreting the provisions of section 25 to find that the President could not use a reliability test based on calculating export prices under section 25. The CITT also erred in imposing non-quantitative factors that the President must consider in assessing the reliability of section 24 export prices in a statutory scheme that is quantitative.\n[77] As a result, I would allow the cross-appeal.\nV. Conclusion [78] I would dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeals. I would set aside the decisions of the CITT and, in rendering the decisions that the CITT should have made, I would dismiss the appeals of Remington and HCI from the re-determination of the amount of the anti-dumping duties. I would award costs to the President and Hitachi in relation to Remington\u2019s appeal and the cross-appeal in relation to that appeal.\n\u201cWyman W. Webb\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nJ.B.

The Board substituted the termination of employment by a one-month suspension without pay. The applicant did not seek judicial review of that decision.\n[2] Two years after the merits decision, the Board rendered a subsequent decision with respect to damages (2022 FPSLREB 95) whereby it ordered aggravated damages for psychological harm suffered by the respondent ($135,000) as well as punitive damages for the denial of the respondent\u2019s right to natural justice ($75,000) and obstruction to the administration of justice ($100,000). This is the decision challenged by the applicant before our Court.\n[3] Essentially, the applicant contends that the aggravated and punitive damage awards are unreasonable as they do not accord with the applicable jurisprudential framework.\n[4] During the hearing before our Court, the debate mostly centered around the Supreme Court\u2019s leading decision on punitive damage awards, Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co., 2002 SCC 18, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 595 (Whiten), and, more particularly, the principle of \u201cproportionality\u201d. The applicant contends that the Board misapplied the Whiten factors and thus failed to consider the \u201cproportionality\u201d of the punitive damages awarded in the present case.\n[5] The applicant\u2019s contention is unpersuasive when considered in light of a careful reading of Whiten. Indeed, although the Board does not explicitly refer to a proportionality analysis in its reasons, this is not fatal to the decision. The Board weighed the relevant factors set forth by the Supreme Court in Whiten and, in particular, considered the other damages award, addressed the need for additional damages (punitive), and it is clear, when the reasons are read as a whole, why, in the Board\u2019s view, the punitive damages award was not disproportionate in the context of the specific circumstances of this case, hence falling within the \u201cbounds of rationality\u201d (Whiten at paras 123, 128). The Board\u2019s 67-page decision, again, when read as a whole, addresses the relevant factors throughout its analysis, as is evidenced at paragraphs 179\u201386, 231\u201335, 240, 243\u201344.\n[6] Overall, the Board\u2019s decision is detailed and it thoroughly addresses the evidence and relevant jurisprudence. The Board\u2019s decision bears the hallmark of reasonableness: it is justified, transparent, and intelligible and falls within the range of acceptable outcomes (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, 441 D.L.R. (4th) 1).\n[7] In reality, the applicant disagrees with the Board\u2019s decision and has sought to challenge it by putting form over substance. In doing so, the applicant invites our Court to reweigh the evidence, make our own findings, and conclude that the quantum of aggravated and punitive damages is disproportionate and unreasonable. This is not our role on reasonableness review. On the particular facts of this case, I see no error that would warrant our intervention.\n[8] For these reasons, I would dismiss the application for judicial review with costs in the all-inclusive amount of $2000.\n\"Richard Boivin\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nRen\u00e9 LeBlanc J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nSylvie E.

PHILIPPE DESROSIERS\nAppellants\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\n(Delivered from the Bench at Ottawa, Ontario, on February 8, 2024).\nBIRINGER J.A.\n[1] The appellants appeal from an interlocutory order of the Tax Court (per Sommerfeldt J.): 2023 TCC 49 [Reasons].\n[2] In the Tax Court, the appellants brought a motion under the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure), SOR\/90-688a to strike assumptions in the Crown\u2019s replies. The Tax Court allowed the motion in part, striking out some of the assumptions, with leave to amend.\n[3] On appeal, the appellants only challenge the following assumption (\u201cFMV Assumption\u201d), which the Tax Court declined to strike:\nThe fair market value of the wines donated by the Appellant and appraised by Nico van Duyvenbode was at most 20% (i.e., a ratio of 1\/5) of the amount stated on the charitable tax receipts[.]\n[4] The Tax Court\u2019s decision not to strike the FMV Assumption was discretionary: Tax Court Rules, subsection 53(1). The appellate standards of review from Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 apply: Canada v. Preston, 2023 FCA 178 at para. 12; Kinglon Investments Inc. v. Canada, 2015 FCA 134 at para. 5.\n[5] As the sole issue in this appeal is whether the Tax Court erred in determining that the FMV Assumption did not meet the threshold for striking out pleadings, a question of mixed fact and law, the standard of review is palpable and overriding error: Kinglon Investments at para. 5; Smith v. Canada, 2022 FCA 91 at para. 16.\n[6] The threshold for striking out pleadings is whether it is \u201cplain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action\u201d: R. v. Imperial Tobacco, 2011 SCC 42 at para. 17; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Canada, 2013 FCA 122 at para. 7; Reasons at para. 19.\n[7] Here, the essence of the appellants\u2019 submission is that the FMV Assumption does not, or cannot, support the Crown\u2019s case. They assert that the Minister arrived at the FMV Assumption by inappropriately relying on statistical data from years (2001\u20132004) that are not at issue. They seek to have the decision of the Tax Court on the FMV Assumption set aside or, in the alternative, to have the FMV Assumption amended to provide data relevant to the taxation years in question.\n[8] The Tax Court judge was alive to the appellants\u2019 submission on the data set: Reasons at paras. 86 and 90. Moreover, the appellants\u2019 argument goes to the merits of the appeal \u2014 whether the FMV Assumption can be proven: House v. Canada, 2011 FCA 234 at para. 30. As the Tax Court judge correctly concluded, the factual dispute about the FMV Assumption will be resolved at trial: Reasons at paras. 37-39 and 91. There, with the benefit of discovery, the parties can each adduce evidence that goes to the soundness of the Minister\u2019s reassessments, including the methodology underlying the FMV Assumption and the data set to which it was applied. The appellants will have an opportunity to \u201cdemolish\u201d the FMV Assumption.\n[9] \u201cWhether the evidence substantiates the pleaded facts, now or at some future date, is irrelevant to the motion to strike\u201d: Imperial Tobacco at para. 23. In assessing the \u201cplain and obvious\u201d standard, it is assumed that pleaded facts can be proven. It is not for a motion judge to \u201cusurp the function of the trial judge\u201d by making determinations of fact or relevance on a preliminary basis: Sentinel Hill Productions (1999) Corp. v. The Queen, 2007 TCC 742 at para. 4; LBL Holdings v. Canada, 2016 FCA 17 at para. 5.\n[10] Here, it cannot be said that the FMV Assumption, if taken to be true, does not provide a reasonable basis for the reassessment: CIBC at para. 7. If the fair market value of the donated wines was \u201cat most 20% \u2026 of the amount stated on the charitable tax receipts,\u201d that goes directly to the grounds for reassessment. Nor is the FMV Assumption \u201cmanifestly incapable of being proven\u201d: Imperial Tobacco at para. 22; Operation Dismantle v. The Queen, 1985 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441 at para. 27. It is not at all \u201cplain and obvious\u201d that the FMV Assumption should be struck.\n[11] The appellants have not established that the Tax Court made a palpable and overriding error in declining to strike the FMV Assumption. The appeal will be dismissed, with costs fixed at $3,000, all-inclusive.\n\u201cMonica Biringer\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-145-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nIRVING EBERT, RICHARD HERMAN and P.

In the Decision, the CRTC directed Bell and Telus Communications Inc. (TCI) to provide reseller competitors access to Bell and TCI\u2019s fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) facilities \u201cover aggregated wholesale HSA\u201d, within Ontario and Quebec, by no later than May 7, 2024. Such access was mandated by the CRTC on a temporary basis, pending the outcome of a broader review that the CRTC is undertaking, following a Notice of Consultation the CRTC issued on March 8, 2023.\n[2] A little background is helpful to put this motion and the Decision into context.\n[3] FTTP facilities enable access to high-speed internet. In ordering the temporary provision of access to Bell and TCI\u2019s FTTP facilities over aggregated wholesale HSA, the Decision requires Bell and TCI (the latter, for only a relatively small number of customers) to allow reseller competitors to temporarily access, on an aggregated basis, Bell and TCI\u2019s fibre network facilities in Ontario and Quebec that deliver to customers wireline access to high-speed internet. The CRTC was of the view that this would open the door to competitors to sell high-speed internet services in Ontario and Quebec that are competitive to those offered by Bell and TCI. In the Decision, the CRTC also mandated the wholesale rates that Bell and TCI can charge resellers on an interim basis for such aggregated access to their FTTP facilities.\n[4] In 2015, the CRTC mandated that facilities based carriers, including Bell and TCI, were required to provide disaggregated FTTP services to resellers and set the wholesale rates that could be charged to resellers for such services.\n[5] The difference between aggregated and disaggregated access is usefully summarized by Bell, at paragraphs 18 and 19 of its Written Representations filed in connection with this motion, as follows:\n18. Facilities Based Carriers invest in two types of facilities, among others: transport facilities and access facilities. Transport facilities allow large amounts of data traffic to be sent and received across a fibre network. They are analogous to highways or transmission power lines. Access facilities, by contrast, connect individual customer locations (i.e., premises) to the fibre network. These access facilities are analogous to local roads or distribution power lines.\n19. The CRTC has historically regulated two types of wholesale Internet services using these facilities:\n(a) Aggregated wholesale Internet service: permits Resellers to lease a combination of both: (i) the access facilities needed to connect to customer locations; and (ii) the transport facilities through which large amounts of traffic can be sent and received. Prior to the Decision, aggregated wholesale service was available for Bell\u2019s fibre-to-the-node Internet service (a good Internet service, but not as fast as FTTP service), but was not available for FTTP service, which is an emerging technology that Facilities Based Carriers use to provide the highest speed Internet services available to them; and\n(b) Disaggregated wholesale Internet service: permits Resellers to lease only the access facilities needed to connect to customer locations, but not the transport facilities. Instead, competitors must obtain transport facilities primarily by either investing in their own networks \u2026 or by leasing facilities from other carriers on a commercial basis. Disaggregated wholesale services have been available on FTTP facilities for some time, but, in practice, none of Bell\u2019s competitors made use of them.\n[6] According to some of the respondents to this motion, the disaggregated access option for FTTP was unfeasible because it was too expensive for them on the terms that the CRTC mandated in 2015.\n[7] On February 9, 2023, the Governor in Council issued an order under section 8 of the Telecommunications Act, S.C. 1993, c 38, entitled the Order Issuing a Direction to the CRTC on a Renewed Approach to Telecommunications Policy, SOR\/2023-23, registered February 10, 2023 (P.C. 2023-110 February 9, 2023) (the Policy Direction).\n[8] Section 10 of the Policy Direction provided as follows:\nAggregated wholesale high-speed access service\nService d\u2019acc\u00e8s haute vitesse de gros group\u00e9\n10 The Commission must mandate the provision of an aggregated wholesale high-speed access service \u2014 that is additional to any other types of wholesale high-speed access services that are mandated \u2014 until it determines that broad, sustainable and meaningful competition will persist even if the provision of an aggregated service is no longer mandated.\n10 Le Conseil doit rendre obligatoire la fourniture de services d\u2019acc\u00e8s haute vitesse de gros group\u00e9 \u2014 qui s\u2019ajoutent \u00e0 tout autre type de service d\u2019acc\u00e8s de gros \u00e0 haut d\u00e9bit dont la fourniture est obligatoire \u2014 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il d\u00e9termine qu\u2019une concurrence vaste, durable et significative perdurera m\u00eame si la fourniture d\u2019un service group\u00e9 n\u2019est plus obligatoire.\n[9] On March 7, 2023, the CRTC issued Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2023-56. In it, the CRTC stated that it was going to review the existing framework for wholesale high-speed access (HSA) \u201c\u2026 in light of changing market conditions, the significant challenges in implementing the framework, and the importance to Canadians of having access to greater choice and more affordable services\u201d. The CRTC also set out its preliminary views that:\n(i) the provision of aggregated wholesale HSA services should be mandated; (ii) access to fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) facilities should be provided over these services; and (iii) the provision of FTTP facilities over aggregated wholesale HSA services should be mandated on a temporary and expedited basis, until the Commission reaches a decision as to whether such access is to be provided indefinitely.\n[10] In its Notice of Consultation, the CRTC invited comments from interested parties. Over 300 companies and individuals intervened before the CRTC to provide their views. Among them were Bell and the respondents who have filed submissions on this motion, namely TekSavvy Solutions Inc. (TekSavvy), Qu\u00e9becor Media Inc., on behalf of Vid\u00e9otron Ltd. (QMI), and Competitive Network Operators of Canada (CNOC).\n[11] In the Decision, the CRTC confirmed, in part, its preliminary views on the temporary relief it was considering to impose. As a result, the CRTC mandated that Bell and TCI were to provide reseller competitors access to Bell and TCI\u2019s FTTP facilities over aggregated wholesale HSA, within Ontario and Quebec, by no later than May, 7, 2024, on a temporary basis pending the outcome of the CRTC\u2019s overall review of the framework for HSA services.\n[12] In reaching this conclusion, the CRTC noted that, in recent years, many additional subscribers have subscribed to Bell\u2019s FTTP service and that the competitive intensity in the sector has declined. The CRTC determined that the temporary aggregated FTTP access that it mandated would help stabilize competition. The CRTC also noted that it was its view that \u201c\u2026 competitors\u2019 inability to practically provide services over FTTP networks has severely affected their ability to effectively compete\u201d. The CRTC continued by stating that it was \u201c\u2026 concerned that this negative impact on wholesale-based competition will become even more severe over time [and that absent] regulatory intervention, meaningful wholesale-based competition will continue to decline\u201d (Decision at para. 57).\n[13] The CRTC limited the scope of the temporary mandated FTTP access to Ontario and Quebec, finding that these were the two areas \u201cwhere wholesale based competition [was] most clearly declining\u201d (Decision at paras. 59 and 68).\n[14] In the Decision, the CRTC addressed Bell\u2019s concerns that it might not be able to recover the implementation costs associated with providing temporary access to its FTTP facilities over aggregated wholesale HSA, if such access were not permanently mandated. The CRTC considered that such issues, should they arise, were \u201c... not insurmountable from a regulatory perspective\u201d. The CRTC continued by stating that it was \u201c... prepared to deal with these matters at a later date should this be required\u201d (Decision at para. 67).\n[15] With this background in mind, I turn to now assess the merits of this motion.\n[16] As noted, Bell seeks to stay the Decision until the disposition of its application for leave to appeal the Decision, and if, leave is granted, until the appeal is decided. If Bell\u2019s motion is granted, Bell would not be required to provide its competitors with temporary access to its FTTP facilities over aggregated wholesale HSA within Ontario and Quebec until this Court rules on Bell\u2019s motion for leave to appeal the Decision, and if, leave is granted, until the appeal is decided.\n[17] TekSavvy, QMI, and CNOC oppose the motion.\n[18] The test for the granting a stay in a case like this is well-known and requires the moving party to establish that: (1) their appeal raises a serious issue; (2) they would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; and (3) the balance of convenience favours granting the stay: RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 1994 CanLII 117 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311 at 334 (RJR-MacDonald); Canada v. Canadian Council for Refugees, 2008 FCA 40, 2008 CarswellNat 150 at para. 18 (Canadian Council for Refugees). All three of the foregoing criteria must be met for a stay to be issued by a court.\n[19] The threshold for establishing the first criterion of a serious issue is generally a low one. It will be met in a case, like the present, if the issues raised in the Notice of Appeal are not frivolous or vexatious: RJR-MacDonald at 348; Canadian Council for Refugees at paras. 18, 22. Here, I am prepared to accept, for purposes of this motion, that Bell\u2019s Notice of Appeal raises at least one such issue.\n[20] However, I find that it has not established that it will suffer irreparable harm if the stay is not granted. Thus, the second criterion for the issuance of the requested stay is not met.\n[21] Irreparable harm refers to the nature, as opposed to the extent, of the harm that a party will suffer if a stay is not granted. There must be \u201ca real probability that unavoidable irreparable harm will result unless a stay is granted\u201d: see Arctic Cat, Inc. v. Bombardier Recreational Products Inc., 2020 FCA 116, 176 C.P.R. (4th) 323 at para. 20, citing Glooscap Heritage Society v. Canada (National Revenue), 2012 FCA 255, [2012] F.C.J. No. 1661 (QL) at para. 31 (Glooscap); see also Dywidag Systems International, Canada, Ltd. v. Garford Pty Ltd., 2010 FCA 232, 406 N.R. 304 at para. 14 (Dywidag); Canada (Attorney General) v. Canada (Information Commissioner), 2001 FCA 25, 268 N.R. 328, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 28584 (13 September 2001) at para. 12 (Canada (Information Commissioner)); Laperri\u00e8re v. D. & A. MacLeod Company Ltd., 2010 FCA 84, 402 N.R. 341 at para. 17 (Laperri\u00e8re); Janssen Inc. v. AbbVie Corporation, 2014 FCA 176, 242 A.C.W.S. (3d) 11 at para. 46.\n[22] Irreparable harm is harm that either cannot be quantified in monetary terms or that cannot be compensated: RJR-MacDonald at 341. Irreparable harm is also harm that is unavoidable: Janssen Inc. v. AbbVie Corporation, 2014 FCA 112, 2014 CarswellNat 1434 at para. 24 (Janssen). As this Court explained at paragraph 24 of Janssen, \u201cit would be strange if a litigant complaining of harm it caused itself, harm it could have avoided or repaired, or harm it can still avoid or repair could get such serious relief [as a stay would afford]\u201d.\n[23] In RJR-MacDonald, the Supreme Court of Canada gave examples of the types of harm that may be irreparable because it cannot be quantified. These include instances where the party seeking the stay will be put out of business or will suffer permanent market loss or irreversible damage to its business reputation: see RJR-MacDonald at 341, citing R.L. Crain Inc. v. Hendry, (1988) 48 D.L.R. (4th) 228 (Sask. Q.B.); American Cyanamid Co. v. Ethicon Ltd., [1975] A.C. 396 (UKHL).\n[24] This Court has held that the probability of such irreparable harm occurring must be established by the party seeking the stay through \u201c\u2026 evidence at a convincing level of particularity \u2026. Assumptions, speculations, hypotheticals and arguable assertions, unsupported by evidence, carry no weight\u201d: Glooscap at para. 31, citing to Dywidag at para. 14; Stoney First Nation v. Shotclose, 2011 FCA 232, 2011 CarswellNat 3639 at para. 48 (Shotclose); Canada (Information Commissioner) at para. 12; Laperri\u00e8re at para. 17; see also, to similar effect, Gateway City Church v. Canada (National Revenue), 2013 FCA 126, 2013 CarswellNat 1314 at paras. 14-16 (Gateway City Church).\n[25] As my colleague Stratas J.A. aptly put it in Gateway City Church, \u201c[g]eneral assertions cannot establish irreparable harm. They essentially prove nothing\u201d (see para. 15). This is because, as Stratas J.A. found in Shotclose at paragraph 48:\nIt is all too easy for those seeking a stay in a case like this to enumerate problems, call them serious, and then, when describing the harm that might result, to use broad, expressive terms that essentially just assert \u2013 not demonstrate to the Court\u2019s satisfaction \u2013 that the harm is irreparable.\n[26] Bell notes that the Court has recognized irreparable harm in the context of orders that it has granted to stay certain CRTC decisions pending an appeal. More specifically, in Aboriginal Voices Radio Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 FCA 172, 2015 CarswellNat 12195, this Court stayed a CRTC decision when the decision mandated the closure of a radio station. Further, in North American Gateway Inc. v. Canadian Radio-Television & Telecommunications Commission, [1997] F.C.J. No. 628, 1997 CarswellNat 1268, this Court stayed a CRTC decision when the evidence established that the effect of the CRTC decision was to put those seeking the stay \u201cout of business within days\u201d at para. 13. Finally, in CKLN Radio Incorporated v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FCA 56, 2011 CarswellNat 316, this Court stayed a CRTC decision that would have resulted in the loss of a sought-after radio frequency in a hotly contested market, with the consequence that a campus radio station was likely to be imperilled.\n[27] As will soon become apparent, the foregoing cases are very different from the present one.\n[28] Bell also points to two unreported speaking orders, issued in 2019 by this Court in 19-A-59. However, due to their brevity, neither order provides any indication of the relevant circumstances that led to its issuance beyond the notation that the Court was satisfied that the stay orders were required to prevent market distortion: see Bell\u2019s Motion Record, Tab 4, Exhibits H and I of the Sonia Atwell Affidavit. On the other hand, in the present case, the CRTC made the Decision with a view to correcting such distortion and preserving competition in the high speed internet market in Ontario and Quebec.\n[29] In the present case, Bell puts forward only general assertions of the harm that it says it will suffer if the stay is not granted, as opposed to evidence at a convincing level of particularity that demonstrates a real probability that unavoidable irreparable harm will result unless a stay is granted.\n[30] Bell says that it will suffer three types of harm that it submits are irreparable if it complies with the Decision, including: (1) it will lose customers and revenue; (2) it will incur unrecoverable implementation costs; and (3) it will have to delay or cancel other projects. However, Bell has failed to substantiate that these harms are irreparable with the necessary degree of convincing particularity.\n[31] In support of its allegations of irreparable harm, Bell relies on an affidavit from its Senior Vice President of Technology Services, Ms. Anuja Sheth (Sheth affidavit), that is speculative and lacks supporting evidence for the harm that Bell alleges it will suffer if a stay is refused. Bell also relies on an affidavit from a law clerk that attaches, among other things, certain filings made in the present case before the CRTC, as well as a decision and other filings made in the case before the Competition Tribunal involving the Rogers-Shaw merger, namely Canada (Commissioner of Competition) v. Rogers Communications Inc. and Shaw Communications Inc., 2023 Comp Trib 1, aff\u2019d 2023 FCA 16, 477 D.L.R. (4th) 553 (Rogers Shaw Merger).\n[32] Most of the harms alleged in the Sheth affidavit are premised on the assumption that the CRTC will not permanently order similar access to Bell\u2019s FTTP facilities over aggregated wholesale HSA at the end of its broad policy review. At this point, this is pure speculation.\n[33] Dealing more specifically with each of the alleged harms, Bell provides no evidence, documentary or otherwise, detailing how or why it is likely to permanently lose customers or revenue. Although the Sheth affidavit refers in passing to estimated and hypothetical losses, the affiant provides little, if any, basis to support the amounts or effects alleged.\n[34] Bell\u2019s estimates also lack necessary nuance. For example, as TekSavvy points out, Bell\u2019s figures fail to distinguish between different types of customers. There is no distinction between customers who may migrate from a wholesale-based competitor using Bell\u2019s dedicated-subscriber line services to a wholesale-based competitor using Bell\u2019s FTTP services; customers who may migrate to a wholesale-based competitor that also uses Bell\u2019s FTTP service; or non-customers who might still subscribe to a wholesale-based competitor that accesses Bell\u2019s FTTP services. In all of these examples, Bell would still gain wholesale revenue in relation to these customers, yet the generalizations in the Sheth affidavit would not account for them.\n[35] In my view, the evidence on alleged market loss tendered by Bell in the Sheth affidavit is comparable to the evidence in Gateway City Church. It is not \u201cevidence at a convincing level of particularity that demonstrates a real probability that unavoidable irreparable harm will result unless a stay is granted\u201d: Gateway City Church at para. 16. It includes several assumptions, speculations, and hypotheticals that are unsupported by evidence and \u201ccarry no weight\u201d: see Glooscap at para. 31.\n[36] Bell also premises its arguments relating to loss of market share and revenue on certain filings made in this case before the CRTC by TekSavvy and CNOC, the Decision, and on the Competition Tribunal\u2019s decision in Rogers Shaw Merger and related filings. Yet, none of the foregoing establishes a real probability that Bell will irreparably lose market share or revenues. While the CRTC intends, via the Decision, to increase competition in the sector, and TekSavvy and CNOC indicated in their submissions to the CRTC that they believed that the temporary access the CRTC contemplated was required, this does not establish a real probability that Bell will permanently lose market share or revenues. As the respondents convincingly point out in their responding materials, the fact that competition might increase does not necessarily translate into a loss of market share for Bell. Further, Bell has offered no details that substantiate how the interim wholesale rates the CRTC has mandated compare to the discounted prices Bell is already offering certain customers.\n[37] As for the Competition Tribunal\u2019s decision in Rogers Shaw Merger and related filings, namely the Responding Witness Statement from Mr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lescadres, I fail to see how they prove much, if anything, of relevance when that case dealt with at least somewhat different services, markets, and issues. While the Competition Tribunal did recognize that Videotron\u2019s acquisition of VMedia, a reseller, was indicative of Videotron\u2019s plans to expand into Ontario, Bell has not offered any evidence linking such an expansion to any permanent loss of its market share or revenues.\n[38] Turning to the alleged unrecoverable implementation costs, the CTRC\u2019s assurance that it can address these concerns, if necessary, is a complete answer to this argument, given that Bell has provided no evidence that shows how or why the CRTC cannot do so. The Sheth affidavit does not convincingly establish that the CRTC could not mandate new rates that would allow Bell to recapture costs expended to institute temporary access in the event the CRTC were to decide not to permanently order similar access to Bell\u2019s FTTP facilities over aggregated wholesale HSA at the end of its broad policy review.\n[39] Finally, Bell\u2019s own choices to redirect or cut its investment dollars do not constitute irreparable harm, but rather a business choice that it appears that it has chosen to make in light of the Decision. In the absence of evidence showing how implementing the temporary mandated access would imperil Bell\u2019s continued existence, I fail to see how making the investments required to implement the Decision instead of others could constitute irreparable harm.\n[40] For all of these reasons, Bell has not demonstrated, to the Court\u2019s satisfaction, \u201cthe actual existence or real probability of harm that can not be repaired later\u201d: Shotclose at para. 48. Its assertions lack the necessary particularity to succeed on part two of the RJR-MacDonald test.\n[41] Given that the RJR-MacDonald test is conjunctive, Bell\u2019s inability to establish that it will suffer irreparable harm means that its motion for stay must be dismissed. It is therefore unnecessary for me to comment on the third factor in the RJR-MacDonald test, being that of the balance of convenience.\n[42] I will accordingly dismiss this motion with a single set of costs, payable by Bell in equal parts to each of the respondents, TekSavvy, QMI, and CNOC.\n\u201cMary J.L.

VIATRIS CANADA and BIOSIMILAR COLLABORATIONS IRELAND LIMITED\nRespondents\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\n(Delivered from the Bench at Ottawa, Ontario, on February 13, 2024).\nBOIVIN J.A.\n[1] The appellants appeal from the judgment of Furlanetto J. of the Federal Court (the judge) rendered on October 3, 2023 (2023 FC 1325), which dismissed the appellants\u2019 application for judicial review of a decision of the Minister of Health (the Minister). The Minister\u2019s decision held that the respondent, Biosimilar Collaborations Ireland Limited, should obtain the benefits of section 5 of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations, SOR\/93-133 (Regulations), in particular, prior service of the Notice of Allegation. The judge found that the Minister\u2019s decision should be reviewed under the reasonableness standard and concluded that the decision was reasonable.\n[2] When seized of an appeal from an application for judicial review disposed of by the Federal Court, this Court must step into the shoes of the Federal Court and concentrate on the administrative decision in question (Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559 at para. 46).\n[3] We are all of the view that this appeal cannot succeed.\n[4] Firstly, with respect to the standard of review, the judge did not err in refusing to apply the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. Entertainment Software Association, 2022 SCC 30, 471 D.L.R. (4th) 391, exception to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. As observed by the judge, our Court in Teva Canada Limited v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2016 FCA 248, [2017] 3 F.C.R. 80 at paras 56\u201357 found that this Court\u2019s role as first instance decision-maker arises only when a proceeding is initiated under section 6 of the Regulations (see also AbbVie Corporation v. Canada (Health), 2022 FC 1209). Hence, contrary to the appellants\u2019 contention, there is no concurrent jurisdiction between the Federal Court and the Minister in terms of the administration of section 5 of the Regulations: it squarely falls within the purview of the Minister. As such, the standard of review in this case is reasonableness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653 (Vavilov)).\n[5] Secondly, the appellants have submitted a number of arguments alleging that the Minister\u2019s decision is both incorrect and unreasonable. However, we see no errors in the Minister\u2019s reasoning that would warrant our intervention. The Minister\u2019s interpretation is consistent with the purpose and scheme of the Regulations (Janssen Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2023 FCA 253; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 26, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 533) and his decision is both justifiable and justified and bears the hallmarks of reasonableness as required by Vavilov.\n[6] As stated above, the judge correctly identified the standard of review and properly applied it. Specifically, the judge\u2019s reasons are thorough and we can do no better than to adopt them as our own. Our intervention is not required.\n[7] The appeal will be dismissed with costs to the respondents.\n\"Richard Boivin\"\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-283-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nBAYER INC. and, REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. v.

Introduction [1] In 1996, Falconbridge Limited (Falconbridge) offered to acquire publicly-traded shares of Diamond Fields Resources Inc. (Diamond Fields) for consideration valued at approximately $4.1 billion. A bidding auction took place and Falconbridge lost to its competitor, Inco Ltd. (Inco). In connection with its offer, Falconbridge received fees (Fees) from Diamond Fields totalling $101,541,987.\n[2] The appellant, Glencore Canada Corporation (Glencore), is a successor to Falconbridge. Pursuant to the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (Act), Glencore received a reassessment for Falconbridge\u2019s 1996 taxation year in which the Fees, less related expenses, were included in income. The Tax Court of Canada (per Favreau J.) upheld the reassessment for reasons (TC Reasons) cited as 2021 TCC 63. Glencore appeals from this judgment to this Court.\n[3] As explained below, I would dismiss the appeal but for different reasons than the Tax Court. The Tax Court determined that the Fees constituted income from a business in accordance with s. 9(1) of the Act. I also conclude that the Fees were income from a business, and income from property, but pursuant to s. 12(1)(x) of the Act.\nB. Background The auction [4] The target of the bidding auction (Diamond Fields) and the bidders (Falconbridge and Inco) were all Canadian mining companies. The auction unfolded over a 2-month period early in 1996.\n[5] At the relevant time, Falconbridge was an established public corporation whose operations were described by the Tax Court as exploring, developing, mining, processing, marketing and selling metals and minerals (TC Reasons at para. 4). The business was conducted by Falconbridge directly and through subsidiary corporations (TC Reasons at para. 9).\n[6] Diamond Fields was also a public corporation. Its primary asset was a nickel-copper-cobalt deposit (Deposit) at Voisey\u2019s Bay, Labrador which it acquired in February 1995. At all material times, the Deposit was owned by a Diamond Fields\u2019 subsidiary, Voisey\u2019s Bay Nickel Company (Voisey\u2019s Bay Co.).\n[7] Inco was also a public corporation and was a major competitor of Falconbridge.\n[8] The sequence of events below is based mainly on the parties\u2019 agreed statement of facts:\n(i) On June 8, 1995, Diamond Fields and Inco entered into an agreement regarding the Deposit. Under its terms:\n(a)Inco acquired 25 percent of the shares of Voisey\u2019s Bay Co.;\n(b)Inco agreed to market all nickel and cobalt production from the Deposit for the first 5 years of production and agreed to market a minimum amount of nickel production for the following 15 years; and\n(c)In the event that Diamond Fields received a takeover offer from a third party, it agreed to notify Inco of the offer and provide Inco with a reasonable opportunity to discuss it.\n(ii) Also on June 8, 1995, Inco announced that it had acquired 2 million of the outstanding Diamond Fields common shares.\n(iii) Early in 1995, Falconbridge held discussions with Diamond Fields to acquire an interest in the Deposit. These discussions failed.\n(iv) Early in 1996, Diamond Fields contacted Falconbridge about a possible sale of its 75 percent interest in Voisey\u2019s Bay Co.\n(v) On February 9, 1996, Falconbridge and Diamond Fields agreed to arrangements to merge under which Falconbridge would offer to acquire the outstanding common shares of Diamond Fields by way of a plan of arrangement. The consideration to be received by the Diamond Fields shareholders was to be a combination of Falconbridge shares, cash and exchangeable notes for a total value of approximately $4.1 billion. These arrangements acknowledged that Diamond Fields would discuss the Falconbridge offer with Inco pursuant to the agreement mentioned above.\n(vi) On March 26, 1996, Inco also made an offer to acquire Diamond Fields\u2019 outstanding common shares. The consideration was to consist of Inco shares, cash and exchangeable notes with a total value of approximately $4.3 billion.\n(vii) On April 2, 1996, Falconbridge made a counter-offer.\n(viii) On April 3, 1996, the Diamond Fields board of directors recommended that its shareholders reject the Falconbridge counter-offer and accept Inco\u2019s offer.\n(ix) On April 9, 1996, Falconbridge dropped out of the bidding.\n(x) Diamond Fields\u2019 shareholders eventually accepted Inco\u2019s offer and the merger was completed in August 1996.\nThe Falconbridge merger arrangements [9] The merger arrangements between Falconbridge and Diamond Fields contemplated the Fees that are at issue in this appeal. There were two fees, which were called a Commitment Fee and a Non-Completion Fee.\n[10] A Commitment Fee in the amount of $28,206,106 was payable by Diamond Fields to Falconbridge upon entering into the merger arrangements. This occurred on February 9, 1996.\n[11] A Non-Completion Fee in the amount of $73,335,881 was payable by Diamond Fields to Falconbridge upon certain conditions being satisfied. One of these was that a competing offer was completed. This fee is described in greater detail below.\n[12] The Fees were both paid in 1996.\n[13] The merger arrangements included an Arrangement Agreement. It set out the terms and conditions on which the merger would be carried out.\n[14] The Arrangement Agreement provided that Falconbridge and Diamond Fields were each required to use reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary approvals to complete the merger. This included approvals from the corporations\u2019 respective shareholders. In addition, Diamond Fields agreed that it would not facilitate discussions with others concerning a competing bid. This obligation only took effect after Diamond Fields had an opportunity to discuss Falconbridge\u2019s offer with Inco.\n[15] The Arrangement Agreement also specified that the terms and conditions were subject to the fiduciary duties of Diamond Fields\u2019 board of directors. This meant that throughout the bidding process another bidder (including Inco) could make an offer that the board of directors might decide to support instead. This is in fact what occurred.\nC. Tax Court decision [16] The Tax Court stated that the appeal raised two issues: (1) whether the Fees were properly included in Glencore\u2019s income; and (2) in the alternative, whether the Fees gave rise to a capital gain.\n[17] With respect to the first issue, the Tax Court divided this into two sub-issues: (1) whether the Fees were income from a source pursuant to s. 3 of the Act; and (2) whether the Fees were taxable under s. 12(1)(x) of the Act.\n[18] The Tax Court concluded that the first sub-issue was dispositive of the appeal. It determined that the Fees were income from a source since they were income from a business pursuant to s. 9(1) of the Act. The Tax Court declined to discuss the other issues.\n[19] The Tax Court\u2019s analysis of s. 9(1) of the Act is discussed below.\nD. Issues and Standard of Review [20] This appeal gives rise to three issues:\n(i) Did the Tax Court err in concluding that the Fees were business income pursuant to s. 9(1) of the Act?\n(ii) Did the Non-Completion Fee give rise to a capital gain?\n(iii) Should the Fees be included in computing income from a business or property pursuant to s. 12(1)(x) of the Act?\n[21] The Tax Court judgment is subject to appellate standards of review as set out in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. Determinations of fact and mixed fact and law are entitled to deference and attract the palpable and overriding error standard of review. Determinations of law (including extricable legal questions) are subject to correctness review.\n[22] Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada commented on the application of these standards of review in circumstances where the overall conclusion is based on an extricable error of law (Deans Knight Income Corp. v. Canada, 2023 SCC 16 at para. 121). The reasons of the majority state that no deference is owed to the overall conclusion, but that deference continues to apply to factual findings. However, it cautions that \u201cfacts which were decisive when answering the wrong legal question are not necessarily as salient when answering the right one.\u201d\nE. Issue 1 \u2013 Did the Tax Court err in concluding that the Fees were business income pursuant to s. 9(1)? [23] The Tax Court applied the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Ikea Ltd. v. Canada, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 196, 155 D.L.R. (4th) 295 [Ikea]. As I explain below, the principles from Ikea were misinterpreted by the Tax Court and this resulted in an extricable error of law.\n[24] Ikea, the well-known furniture retailer, received a tenant inducement payment (TIP) from the West Edmonton Mall in connection with entering into a long-term lease. The issue was whether the TIP was received on income or capital account. The Supreme Court noted that s. 12(1)(x) of the Act could not apply because the provision was not in force at the relevant time (Ikea at para. 20).\n[25] In the Supreme Court, Iacobucci J. concluded that the TIP was received on income account based on the factual finding that the TIP was made to reimburse rent or other obligations on revenue account. The Court stated that since \u201cthe TIP was made to reimburse an expense on income account [it] was clearly itself income\u201d (Ikea at para. 29).\n[26] The conclusion was summarized at paragraph 33 of Ikea. This is reproduced below, with emphasis on the passage that was relied on by the Tax Court.\n[33] In my view, Bowman J. was entirely correct in finding that the TIP received by Ikea was on revenue account and should have been included in income for tax purposes. The payment was clearly received as part of ordinary business operations and was, in fact, inextricably linked to such operations. On the evidence, no question of linkage to a capital purpose can seriously be entertained. Had Ikea wished, it could have requested that the TIP be advanced expressly for the specific purpose of fixturing, or to defray some other capital cost. It did not do so, however, and the payment was in fact made free of any conditions for or stipulations as to its use. Therefore, whether the TIP represented a reduction in rent or a payment in consideration of Ikea\u2019s assumption of its various obligations under the lease, it clearly cannot be treated as a capital receipt and should have been included in Ikea\u2019s income. . . .\n[Emphasis added]\n[27] The passage that was relied on by the Tax Court is broadly worded. It needs to be read in context. The Tax Court failed to do this, as demonstrated in the following excerpt from its reasons, and in particular the underlined passage:\n[74] The potential acquisition of DFR was a means to acquiring the Voisey\u2019s Bay deposit and the evidence clearly establishes that the Falconbridge\u2019s business included the acquisition of mineral deposits.\n[75] The Break Fees received by Falconbridge were inextricably linked to Falconbridge\u2019s ordinary business operations as a nickel mining company. Falconbridge pursued the Voisey\u2019s Bay deposit for the purpose of making a profit. As a public company, all of Falconbridge\u2019s activities were directed to that end i.e. to increase shareholder value. The potential acquisition of the Voisey\u2019s Bay deposit was part of Falconbridge\u2019s strategy for earning income from its business.\n[76] Falconbridge was carrying on its business when it negotiated the Merger Offer Delivery Agreement and the Arrangement Agreement, both of which provided for the fees in dispute. Falconbridge\u2019s strategy in attempting to acquire the Voisey\u2019s Bay deposit was to maximize shareholder value by maintaining and bolstering its ore reserves and by containing its production costs. These goals were inextricable [sic] interwoven with Falconbridge\u2019s business. The Break Fees were ancillary business income received by Falconbridge in the course of earning income from business.\n[Emphasis added]\n[28] The Court\u2019s interpretation of Ikea, and its application to the facts, essentially ignores the distinction between capital and revenue receipts. This was the very issue in Ikea.\n[29] When Ikea is read as a whole, it is evident that Iacobucci J.\u2019s reference to ordinary business operations in paragraph 33 is referring to something on revenue account. The very next sentence in Ikea states that there is no link to a capital purpose.\n[30] The necessary linkage to something on revenue account is also made clear at paragraph 30 of Ikea:\n[30] As for the second contention, Ikea argued that if the payment were to be characterized as consideration for its continued obligation to carry on business in the premises during the term of the lease, it should be considered a capital receipt because such a payment goes to the \u201cstructure of the business\u201d. With respect, however, I believe this submission misses the mark. An accurate characterization of the receipt requires an assessment of the nature of the specific obligations in question. In this case, as Bowman J. correctly found, Ikea\u2019s obligations under the lease essentially consisted of the payment of rent and the operation of its business in the leased premises. These were clearly expenses incurred in the day\u2011to\u2011day operation of the business and were therefore on revenue account.\n[31] The Tax Court\u2019s misinterpretation of Ikea is an extricable error of law. It should have considered whether the Fees were linked to something on revenue account. Accordingly, the outcome in the Tax Court is not entitled to deference.\n[32] As explained below, in my view the Fees have no linkage to revenue.\n[33] The Tax Court made factual findings that the Fees were linked to \u201cpursuing the Voisey\u2019s Bay deposit for the purpose of making a profit. As a public company, all of Falconbridge\u2019s activities were directed to that end\u201d (TC Reasons at para. 75). However, the Fees were actually linked to pursuing shares, not the Deposit itself. Either way, the linkage is to a capital purpose. The fact that the goal was to make a profit does not transform the linkage to a revenue item. The clear linkage was to capital.\n[34] In this Court, the Crown submitted that the application of Ikea in this case is supported by the decision of this Court in Morguard Corporation v. Canada, 2012 FCA 306 [Morguard]. In Morguard, this Court upheld a decision of the Tax Court which applied Ikea to a break fee received as part of a failed takeover bid.\n[35] However, the facts in Morguard are materially different from the facts in this case. For example, in Morguard the Tax Court determined that Morguard Corporation was in the business of acquiring companies. In this case, the Tax Court found that Falconbridge was not in the business of acquiring or selling companies (TC Reasons at para. 73). It is not surprising that the Tax Court did not rely on Morguard.\n[36] The Crown urged us to apply Morguard despite this difference. Essentially, it seeks to extend Morguard beyond its particular facts. In my view, an extension to the facts of this case is not warranted because it would erode the well-entrenched principles as to the distinction between items on capital and revenue account. I am not aware of any facts in this case which would provide a sufficient link between the Fees and something on revenue account. I conclude that the Fees were received on capital account because the linkage was to a proposed acquisition of a capital asset.\nF. Issue 2 \u2013 Did the Non-Completion Fee give rise to a capital gain? [37] Glencore submits that the $73 million Non-Completion Fee is compensation to Falconbridge for disposing of its right to merge with Diamond Fields. As such, the receipt of the Non-Completion Fee gave rise to a capital gain. This argument was not discussed by the Tax Court.\n[38] For clarity, this submission does not apply to the Commitment Fee.\n[39] A capital gain is generally a gain from the disposition of property, unless the gain is otherwise included in computing income. The capital gain is calculated as the compensation received for the disposition, less the cost of the property disposed of and expenses incurred in the disposition.\n[40] Whether the Non-Completion Fee gave rise to a capital gain depends in large part on the bid terms set out in the Arrangement Agreement. It required that Falconbridge and Diamond Fields each facilitate the completion of the merger. This required approvals from the shareholders of both companies. The Arrangement Agreement also provided that nothing in that agreement restricted Diamond Fields\u2019 board of directors from supporting or facilitating a competing bid in fulfilment of its fiduciary duties.\n[41] The Arrangement Agreement also set out the different circumstances in which the Non-Completion Fee would be payable. In all cases, the Non-Completion Fee was not payable unless a competing offer was made and completed. The circumstances which triggered Diamond Fields\u2019 obligation to pay the Non-Completion Fee were: (1) a competing offer was made before August 31, 1996; (2) the Arrangement Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms when Falconbridge dropped out of the bidding; and (3) the transaction contemplated by the competing offer was completed.\n[42] To qualify as a capital gain, the Non-Completion Fee must be received as compensation for the disposition of property. Glencore submits that the Non-Completion Fee was received as compensation for the disposition of Falconbridge\u2019s right to merge.\n[43] I reject this submission. Neither the Arrangement Agreement nor any other agreement provided Falconbridge with a right to merge. Diamond Fields did not promise that the merger with Falconbridge would be completed. It could not make that promise for two reasons. First, Falconbridge\u2019s offer was directed to Diamond Fields shareholders. Diamond Fields could not promise their acceptance of the offer. Second, Diamond Fields\u2019 board of directors was not obligated to support Falconbridge\u2019s bid if there was a competing bid that, by virtue of their fiduciary duties, the directors were required to support.\n[44] I conclude that the Non-Completion Fee was not paid as compensation for the disposition of the right to merge. The receipt of this fee did not give rise to a capital gain.\nG. Issue 3 \u2013 Should the Fees be included in computing income pursuant to s. 12(1)(x)? [45] The main position of the Crown in this appeal is that the Fees are income from a business pursuant to Ikea. In the alternative, the Crown submits that the Fees are income pursuant to s. 12(1)(x) of the Act either as an inducement or a reimbursement. This alternative argument was not discussed by the Tax Court.\n[46] Paragraph 12(1)(x) was enacted pursuant to a proposal in the federal budget of May 22, 1985. The proposal is described in the budgetary supplementary information:\nIt is a generally accepted commercial principle that the cost of an asset or the amount of an expense should be reduced by any reimbursement or similar payment received that relates to the acquisition of the asset or the incurring of the expense. For example, a commercial tenant who was reimbursed by a landlord for part or all of the cost of making leasehold improvements would subtract the payment in computing the cost of such property. A similar result would arise with respect to manufacturers\u2019 rebates.\nRecent court decisions have indicated that this principle may not apply for income tax purposes.\nThe budget proposes to require that all payments in the nature of reimbursements or inducements in respect of the acquisition of an asset or the incurring of a deductible expense be included in income for tax purposes unless the recipient elects to reduce the cost basis of the related property or the amount of related expense. This would apply to payments received after May 22, 1985 other than payments received under an agreement in writing made on or before that date. The law already specifically requires similar treatment for certain payments received as government assistance for the acquisition of property.\n[47] The current version of s. 12(1)(x) is reproduced below in relevant part. There are no material changes from the version applicable to this appeal.\n12(1) There shall be included in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year as income from a business or property such of the following amounts as are applicable\n12(1) Sont \u00e0 inclure dans le calcul du revenu tir\u00e9 par un contribuable d\u2019une entreprise ou d\u2019un bien, au cours d\u2019une

issues:\n(i) Do the exclusions in s. 12(1)(x)(v) or (vii) apply to the Fees?\n(ii) Is the payer requirement in s. 12(1)(x)(i) or (ii) satisfied?\n(iii) Is it reasonable to consider that the Fees were received as an inducement or reimbursement for the purposes of s. 12(1)(x)(iii) or (iv)?\n(iv) Were the Fees received in the course of earning income from a business or property?\nSubparagraphs 12(1)(x)(v) and (vii) - Exclusions [49] Paragraph 12(1)(x) contains several exclusions. The potentially relevant ones in this case are ss. 12(1)(x)(v) and (vii).\n[50] Subparagraph 12(1)(x)(v) excludes, among other things, an amount that would otherwise be included in computing income. The parties provided no submissions which would give the Court a basis to apply this exclusion.\n[51] As for s. 12(1)(x)(vii), this provision (in combination with related provisions), permits a taxpayer to reduce a s. 12(1)(x) income inclusion to the extent that the receipt relates to an outlay or expense that is not deducted in computing income. The parties agree that this provision applies in respect of Falconbridge\u2019s expenses related to the bid. Accordingly, the amount of the Fees that are potentially subject to s. 12(1)(x) is reduced by the amount of the bid expenses.\nSubparagraph 12(1)(x)(i) or (ii) \u2013 The payer requirement [52] Paragraph 12(1)(x) requires that the payer satisfy one of the criteria set out in s. 12(1)(x)(i) and (ii). This is not at issue because Glencore concedes that the requirement is satisfied.\nSubparagraph 12(1)(x)(iii) or (iv) \u2013 Type of receipts [53] Subparagraphs 12(1)(x)(iii) and (iv) set out the type of receipts that s. 12(1)(x) applies to. They include amounts that \u201ccan reasonably be considered to have been received\u201d (1) as a reimbursement in respect of the cost of property or an outlay or expense, or (2) as an inducement. As explained below, I conclude that the Fees were received as an inducement.\n[54] The inducement provision in s. 12(1)(x)(iii) is broad. First, the dictionary definition of the word \u201cinducement\u201d suggests that it applies in a variety of circumstances. In the Oxford English Dictionary (Online: https:\/\/www.oed.com), the meaning includes \u201cthat which induces; something attractive by which a person is led on or persuaded to action.\u201d\n[55] Second, the text of s. 12(1)(x)(iii) suggests that the term \u201cinducement\u201d is intended to be all encompassing. Indeed, the provision in both English and French versions specifies certain types of receipts and then adds \u201cany other form of inducement\u201d in English and \u201cou sous toute autre forme\u201d in French.\n[56] I also note that s. 12(1)(x)(iii) applies to inducements generally. This contrasts with the reimbursement provision in s. 12(1)(x)(iv) which requires that the receipt is in respect of the cost of property or an outlay or expense. The difference in wording appears to be a change from the supplementary budget information reproduced above.\n[57] In this case, the Fees satisfy the inducement requirement in s. 12(1)(x)(iii). It is reasonable to consider that the Commitment Fee and the Non-Completion Fee were received by Falconbridge as an inducement to entice Falconbridge to commit to make an offer for the shares of Diamond Fields in accordance with the merger arrangements.\n[58] The nature of the Commitment Fee is clear from its name, and also from the fact that it is payable simply by Falconbridge committing to make the offer. Accordingly, the Commitment Fee induces Falconbridge to make the commitment.\n[59] The Non-Completion Fee is a type of fee commonly referred to as a break fee. The general nature of a break fee was recently discussed by the Alberta Securities Commission in Re Bison Acquisition Corp., 2021 ABASC 188 at paras. 231-232, which refers to CW Shareholdings Inc. v. WIC Western International Communications Ltd. (1998), 39 O.R. (3d) 755 (Ontario Court (General Division)):\n[231] Break fees are intended to entice bidders to participate in an auction. As alluded to in the previous section of this decision, they compensate a party for its wasted time, resources, and lost opportunity costs should a proposed transaction fail (CW Shareholdings (Ont. Gen. Div.) at para. 50). They can offset various potential risks, including disclosure risk and reputational risk. From the target\u2019s perspective, agreeing to a break fee may assist it in its goal of generating the best bid to maximize shareholder value. From the bidder\u2019s perspective, a break fee protects against \u201cthe price being shopped and the transaction being abandoned in favour of a marginally better deal\u201d (Pacifica at para. 49).\n[232] CW Shareholdings (Ont. Gen. Div.) is a leading case on the subject of break fees in Canada. In its reasons, the Ontario Court accepted that a break fee is appropriate where (at para. 51):\n(i) it is needed to induce a competing bid;\n(ii) the bid represents better value for shareholders; and\n(iii) the fee reflects \u201ca reasonable commercial balance between its potential negative effect as an auction inhibitor and its potential positive effect as an auction stimulator\u201d (the CW Shareholdings Test).\n[Emphasis added]\n[60] The first sentence in the passage above clearly describes the nature of the Non-Completion Fee in this case. It was an inducement. This is amply supported by the record:\n(i)The Management Information Circular dated March 8, 1996 provided by Diamond Fields to shareholders states that \u201cDiamond Fields believes that Falconbridge would not have entered into the Arrangement Agreement without Diamond Fields\u2019 agreement to pay [the Fees].\u201d\n(ii)At a Falconbridge board meeting held the day before Falconbridge committed to make the offer, Don Lindsay, the lead negotiator on behalf of Falconbridge, reported that Inco would not table an offer unless Diamond Fields first obtained an offer from Falconbridge.\n(iii)Jack Cockwell, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Falconbridge, was asked on cross-examination whether Mr. Friedland, the CEO of Diamond Fields, was trying to get an auction going. Mr. Cockwell\u2019s answer was \u201cNo question.\u201d\n(iv) Don Lindsay testified that \u201cwe were firm that it had to be at least a $100 million break fee.\u201d\n[61] I conclude that Diamond Fields paid the Fees in order to entice Falconbridge to make an offer pursuant to the merger arrangements. Accordingly, it is reasonable to consider that the Fees were received by Falconbridge as an inducement for the purposes of s. 12(1)(x).\n[62] It does not make any difference that the payment of the Non-Completion Fee was conditional on the bid failing. Subparagraph 12(1)(x)(iii) focusses on the reason for the payment. Diamond Fields agreed to make the payment in order to entice Falconbridge to make the offer.\n[63] In addition, the evidence as to Falconbridge\u2019s motivation to negotiate a fee (i.e., to deter another bidder and to earn a profit if the bid failed) is not relevant to this issue. Subparagraph 12(1)(x)(iii) asks the question whether Diamond Fields made the payment as an inducement. Whether Falconbridge had different motivations is not relevant.\n[64] Finally, an inducement for the purpose of s. 12(1)(x) can include a payment made to entice a party to enter into a commercial arrangement. The wording is certainly broad enough, and the Tax Court decision of Bowman J. in Everett\u2019s Truck Stop Ltd. v. Canada, 93 D.T.C. 965 is an example of this application.\n[65] I conclude that it is reasonable to consider that the Fees were received as an inducement for the purposes of s. 12(1)(x)(iii).\nGeneral requirement \u2013 Received in the course of earning income from a business or property [66] The opening language of paragraph 12(1)(x) provides that it only applies to an amount that is: \u201creceived in the course of earning income from a business or property.\u201d\n[67] Since s. 12(1)(x) does not apply to amounts that would otherwise be included in computing income, this requirement only applies to amounts that are not business or property income in accordance with s. 9(1) of the Act. Accordingly, this test is broader than the test for ordinary business and property income under s. 9(1).\n[68] The meaning of the phrase \u201cin the course of\u201d is central to understanding this requirement. It is a phrase that is commonly used in the Act and has generally been given the meaning ascribed to it by Thurlow J. in M.N.R. v. Yonge Eglinton Building Ltd., [1974] 1 F.C. 637; 74 D.T.C. 6180 (FC-AD): \u201cin connection with\u201d; \u201cincidental to\u201d; or \u201carising from\u201d. The French version, \u201cpendant qu\u2019il tirait un revenue d\u2019une enterprise ou d\u2019un bien,\u201d is similarly broad and supports, reinforces and strengthens this interpretation. The question is whether this describes the relationship between the Fees and Falconbridge\u2019s business or property income-earning activity.\n[69] Falconbridge is an integrated nickel mining company that is involved in exploring, developing, mining, processing, marketing and selling metals and minerals. Its operations are carried out directly and through subsidiaries. (TC Reasons at paras. 4, 9).\n[70] The Fees were linked to Falconbridge\u2019s operations as a nickel mining company. These operations required access to ore deposits. (TC Reasons at paras. 74-75). Accordingly, the Fees were received \u201cin connection with\u201d, or \u201cin the course of\u201d, these activities. It is sufficient for the purpose of this test that Falconbridge carries on these operations directly. It is not relevant that Falconbridge also has mining subsidiaries.\n[71] In addition, the Fees were linked to an acquisition of shares that had the capacity to produce property income. Accordingly, the Fees were also received in the course of earning income from property.\n[72] I conclude that the Fees were received by Falconbridge in the course of earning income from a business and property.\nParagraph 12(1)(x) applies\n[73] I conclude that the necessary conditions for the application of s. 12(1)(x) are satisfied in this case. The Fees, less the bid-related expenses, are required to be included in computing income from a business or property.\nH. Disposition [74] The judgment of the Tax Court dismissed Glencore\u2019s appeal from a reassessment for the 1996 taxation year. The conclusion that I have reached does not disturb this result.\n[75] Therefore, I would dismiss this appeal with costs fixed in the amount of $3,000 in accordance with the agreement of the parties.\n\u201cJudith Woods\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nRichard Boivin J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nJ.B.

ENTERTAINMENT INC.\nRespondents\nREASONS FOR ORDER\nLOCKE J.A.\n[1] The individual appellants, Marshall and Antonio Macciacchera, seek leave under Rule 120 of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106, to represent the corporate appellants in this appeal of which they are officers.\n[2] Though the notice of motion indicates that it is a motion in writing, Messrs. Macciacchera have requested in a separate letter that a hearing be scheduled to hear oral submissions. Per Rule 369.2, motions before this Court are generally decided on the basis of written submissions. A request that a motion be heard orally should include reasons. Messrs. Macciacchera\u2019s request for an oral hearing does not include reasons. Further, I see no need for an oral hearing. Accordingly, I will decide this motion on the basis of the written submissions.\n[3] Rule 120 provides that \u201c[a] corporation \u2026 shall be represented by a solicitor in all proceedings, unless the Court in special circumstances grants leave to it to be represented by an officer\u2026\u201d. Messrs. Macciacchera recognize that they bear the onus of showing \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d. They also recognize that this onus generally requires that they demonstrate that (i) they cannot afford a lawyer, (ii) they will not be required to be both advocate and witness; (iii) the issues are not so complex as to be beyond their capabilities; and (iv) the appeal can proceed in an expeditious manner: Glycobiosciences Inc. v. L\u2019Oreal Canada, 2022 FC 1517 at para. 25 (Glycobiosciences); UBS Group AG v Yones, 2022 FC 487 at paras. 7-10.\n[4] The Glycobiosciences decision cited by Messrs. Macciacchera goes on at paragraph 27 to state as follows:\nThe onus on the moving party to establish special circumstances is a high one. The moving party must provide clear and unambiguous evidence establishing special circumstances, and these circumstances must be unusual, uncommon and exceptional, and the result of external forces as distinct from the voluntary acts of the plaintiff (Alpha Marathon Technologies Inc v Dual Spiral Systems Inc, 2005 FC 1582 at para 4 (\u201cAlpha\u201d)).\n[5] Having carefully reviewed the submissions of Messrs. Macciacchera, I have concluded that their motion should be denied because they have failed to demonstrate that they cannot afford a lawyer, and hence they have not convinced me that special circumstances exist.\n[6] As stated in Alpha at paragraph 5, \u201c[t]he ability of [the moving party] to pay for legal representation is without a doubt the most important factor for the Court to consider.\u201d\n[7] As stated in El Mocambo Rocks Inc. v. Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN), 2012 FCA 98 at para. 4, \u201c[t]he demonstration that a corporation cannot afford a solicitor should usually be made by submitting complete and clear financial information concerning the corporation, preferably by means of financial statements.\u201d\n[8] Messrs. Macciacchera address the requirement that they cannot afford a lawyer at paragraph 11 of their written representations. Though they argue that they are committed to pursuing this appeal, and that many steps leading to a hearing have been completed, they do not allege that they cannot afford a lawyer. They provide no financial information whatsoever.\n[9] I recognize that the respondents do not oppose Messrs. Macciacchera\u2019s motion. However, though that may be a relevant factor in addressing a motion under Rule 120, it is not determinative. In this case, it does not outweigh the absence of evidence that Messrs. Macciacchera cannot afford a lawyer.\n[10] The dismissal of Messrs. Macciacchera\u2019s motion has implications for the progress of the present appeal. Without representation, the corporate appellants cannot act. Accordingly, I will order, just as Justice Donald J. Rennie did in his Order dated December 8, 2023, that they appoint new solicitors of record in accordance with Rule 124 within 30 days.\n[11] I note also that a requisition for hearing was filed on January 8, 2024. Though that document indicates that it is on behalf of all of the appellants, it cannot have been on behalf of the corporate appellants because they were not duly represented. Accordingly, I will order, just as Justice Rennie did in his Order dated December 8, 2023, that a fresh requisition for hearing under Rule 347 be filed within 30 days following retainer of new counsel.\n\"George R.

OVERVIEW [1] These reasons address the appeals of two decisions of the Federal Court (per Zinn J.) dismissing the appellant\u2019s motions for permanent stays of proceedings: a decision reported at 2023 FC 35 [Hudson Reasons] dismissing the appellant\u2019s motion for a permanent stay of the proposed class proceeding in Hudson v. Canada and a decision reported at 2023 FC 36 [Pierrot Reasons] dismissing the appellant\u2019s motion for a permanent stay of the proposed class proceeding in Pierrot v. Canada. All references to \u201cReasons\u201d in this decision are to the Hudson Reasons, unless otherwise indicated.\n[2] The appellant brought the motions on the basis that both Hudson and Pierrot are duplicative of already certified class proceedings, Greenwood v. Canada [Greenwood] and Association des membres de la police mont\u00e9e du Qu\u00e9bec v. Canada [AMPMQ]. All four proceedings involve allegations of workplace harassment and discrimination by RCMP management and employees, and claim damages.\n[3] The motion judge dismissed the Hudson motion, having determined that the focus of the proceedings in Hudson differed from those in Greenwood and AMPMQ. In Pierrot, the motion judge dismissed the motion for the reasons given in Hudson but ordered a temporary stay pending a final determination in Hudson: Pierrot Reasons at paras. 6-8.\n[4] The Greenwood plaintiffs intervened in the appeal of the Hudson motion decision to request that the appeal be allowed on the basis that Hudson is duplicative of Greenwood.\n[5] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeals.\nII. THE PARTIES AND THE PROCEEDINGS [6] As a central issue in these appeals is the scope of the class proceedings in Greenwood, AMPMQ, Hudson, and Pierrot, I briefly describe each of them.\nGreenwood [7] The Greenwood action was commenced in 2018. In January 2020, the Federal Court certified Greenwood as a class proceeding: 2020 FC 119. The Crown appealed to this Court, which upheld the certification but modified the class definition and the class period: 2021 FCA 186. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was refused: 2022 CanLII 19060 (S.C.C.). The modified certification order is reported at 2022 FC 1317 [Greenwood Certification Order]. A further amendment to the certification order, concerning the family class (2023 FC 397), was recently appealed to this Court, which allowed the appeal and remitted the matter to the certification judge: 2024 FCA 22.\n[8] Greenwood involves a claim in systemic negligence, including allegations that the RCMP failed to provide its employees \u201cwith a work environment free from bullying, intimidation, and harassment\u201d: Greenwood Certification Order at paras. 4-6.\n[9] The class includes: \u201cAll current or former RCMP Members (ie. Regular, Civilian, and Special Constable Members) and Reservists who worked for the RCMP between January 1, 1995 and the date a collective agreement becomes or became applicable to a bargaining unit to which they belong\u201d: Greenwood Certification Order at para. 2.\n[10] Greenwood excludes claims covered by Merlo v. Her Majesty the Queen [Merlo], Ross et al v. Her Majesty the Queen, and Tiller v. Her Majesty the Queen [Tiller], class proceedings that were settled. Claims covered by AMPMQ are also excluded.\nAMPMQ [11] The AMPMQ action was commenced in 2016. In August 2018, the Superior Court of Quebec certified (or, to use the language of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure, C.Q.L.R. c. C-25.01, \u201cauthorized\u201d) AMPMQ as a class proceeding in Delisle et al. c. Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine, 2018 QCCS 3855 [AMPMQ QCCS Decision]. The Quebec Court of Appeal upheld the certification: 2018 QCCA 1993.\n[12] AMPMQ involves allegations that the RCMP failed to provide a workplace free from \u201cabus de pouvoir\u201d (defined to include physical harassment, psychological harassment, retaliation, discrimination and all other forms of abuse of power), particularly in relation to French speakers and individuals who exercised their freedom of association and right to unionize: AMPMQ QCCS Decision at paras. 234-235.\n[13] The main class includes all members and civilian members of the RCMP that were victims of \u201cabus de pouvoir\u201d by a member of the RCMP Staff (as defined) and on the condition of fulfilling one of the following requirements: \u201chaving suffered the injury in Qu\u00e9bec; having suffered Injury resulting from a Fault committed by a Staff member then situated in Qu\u00e9bec; having to perform their duties for the RCMP in Qu\u00e9bec, at the time when the Injury was committed; or having their domicile or their residence in Qu\u00e9bec when they suffered the Injury\u201d: AMPMQ QCCS Decision at para. 234.\n[14] The AMPMQ class has two subclasses: (1) members of the main group who suffered the injury by reason of belonging to the language group of French speakers; and (2) members of the main group who suffered the injury by reason of their activities related to freedom of association and the right to unionize.\n[15] The class also excludes class members in Merlo: AMPMQ QCCS Decision at para. 234.\nHudson [16] Ms. Hudson was an RCMP member from 1979 to 2009. She commenced the Hudson action in the Federal Court, in July 2020. Ms. Hudson claims that she and other potential class members were subject to racism and racist acts by the RCMP, including demeaning comments, unequal access to benefits, and unequal opportunities for career progression. She says that she and other potential class members suffered career limitations, loss of income, and physical and psychological damage.\n[17] Ms. Hudson alleges that the RCMP breached the proposed class members\u2019 rights to equality under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11 and Quebec Charter of human rights and freedoms, C.Q.L.R., c. C-12; was systemically negligent; failed to apply the provisions of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. R-10, its regulations, and the Code of Conduct promulgated under the RCMP Act in a fair manner; and failed to act honourably and in good faith when dealing with Indigenous class members.\n[18] The proposed class consists of racialized individuals who worked for the RCMP between April 17, 1985 and the date of certification. The proposed class excludes any claims class members have that were resolved in Merlo, Tiller, Copland and Roach v. HMTQ, and Toss, Roy and Satalic v. HMTQ. The claim also excludes claims that class members have in Greenwood (unless that proceeding is decertified) and in AMPMQ (unless that proceeding is de-authorized).\n[19] The parties have filed their materials for the certification motion and await a hearing. In August 2022, the appellant served a notice of motion to strike Hudson on jurisdictional grounds, which it will seek to have heard at the same time as the certification hearing if unsuccessful in having Hudson stayed.\nPierrot [20] The Pierrot action was commenced in the Federal Court, in January 2022. Mr. Pierrot makes similar allegations to those in Hudson but is focused on Indigenous RCMP employees: Pierrot Reasons at para. 4.\n[21] Mr. Pierrot\u2019s counsel have agreed to work with Ms. Hudson\u2019s counsel. Mr. Pierrot has agreed to hold his action in abeyance if Hudson proceeds. Given this agreement between the plaintiffs, the motion judge ordered a stay \u201cpending a final determination in Hudson\u201d: Pierrot Reasons at para. 8.\nNo Carriage Motion [22] When two or more proposed class actions are commenced with respect to the same alleged wrongdoing and counsel are unable to agree on how to proceed, a plaintiff may bring a carriage motion. In a carriage motion, the court is asked to determine which counsel or group of counsel will have \u201ccarriage\u201d of the class action, while the other competing class actions are stayed: LaLiberte v. Day, 2020 FCA 119 at para. 1 [LaLiberte FCA Decision].\n[23] While the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106 [Rules] do not specifically provide for carriage motions, section 50 of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 and paragraph 105(b) of the Rules, read in light of rule 3, give the Federal Courts authority to stay duplicative class actions: LaLiberte v. Day, 2019 FC 766 at para. 36 [LaLiberte FC Decision]; LaLiberte FCA Decision at para. 10.\n[24] According to the interveners, no carriage motion was brought because when the Hudson and Pierrot actions were commenced, Greenwood and AMPMQ had been certified. Instead, the appellant brought motions to indefinitely stay Hudson and Pierrot.\nIII. THE MOTION DECISIONS [25] The motion judge confirmed the Federal Court\u2019s jurisdiction to grant the relief requested pursuant to section 50 of the Federal Courts Act and the Court\u2019s plenary jurisdiction to manage its own proceedings: Reasons at para. 9. The burden was on the moving party to demonstrate that granting a stay of Hudson would serve the interests of justice: Reasons at para. 11.\n[26] The motion judge accepted that if the factual foundation and issues raised in Hudson were duplicative of those in Greenwood and AMPMQ, a stay would likely prevent the costly duplication of judicial and legal resources, lessen the risk of inconsistent decisions, and reduce any prejudice to the appellant in having to defend against the same allegations in different proceedings: Reasons at para. 13.\n[27] In order to determine the extent of overlap, the motion judge considered the \u201cfocus\u201d of each proceeding, relying on the certification orders and decisions in Greenwood and AMPMQ and the pleadings in all of the proceedings.\n[28] The motion judge concluded that Hudson addressed different factual situations and legal issues than Greenwood and AMPMQ. The focus of the former was the impact of systemic racism and implicit misconduct, while the focus of Greenwood was bullying, intimidation, harassment, and explicit misconduct: Reasons at paras. 17, 19, and 27. The focus of AMPMQ was abuse of power based on discrimination resulting in injury because of harassment, psychological harassment, or retaliation: Reasons at para. 18. The motion judge found that there was little mention of racism and no mention of systemic racism in Greenwood or AMPMQ: Reasons at para. 24.\n[29] While acknowledging overlap between the proceedings, the motion judge determined that it would be unfair to Ms. Hudson to break her claim into pieces and require her to litigate them in different actions: Reasons at para. 31. Allowing Hudson to proceed was in the interests of justice. The motion was dismissed.\n[30] For the reasons issued in the Hudson motion, the motion to stay Pierrot was also dismissed: Pierrot Reasons at para. 6. As counsel for Mr. Pierrot agreed to hold the action in abeyance pending a final determination in Hudson, a temporary stay order was issued on that basis.\nIV. ISSUES [31] The central issue is whether the motion judge, in exercising the discretion under paragraph 50(1)(b) of the Federal Courts Act and refusing to stay Hudson and Pierrot, committed an error warranting this Court\u2019s intervention.\n[32] The appellant and the interveners submit that the motion judge made errors in law and in fact. They say that the motion judge erred in (a) failing to take into account the goals of class proceedings; (b) characterizing the legal claims in the various proceedings; and (c) characterizing the factual foundation of the claims.\nV. ANALYSIS (1) Legislation: paragraph 50(1)(b) of the Federal Courts Act\n[33] Part 5.1 of the Rules does not specifically provide for stays of class proceedings (whether proposed or certified, multi-jurisdictional or in the same jurisdiction). The motion judge\u2019s decision was rendered pursuant to paragraph 50(1)(b) of the Federal Courts Act, which applies to all proceedings. It provides:\n50 (1) The Federal Court of Appeal or the Federal Court may, in its discretion, stay proceedings in any cause or matter\n\u2026\n(b) where for any other reason it is in the interest of justice that the proceedings be stayed.\n50 (1) La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ont le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de suspendre les proc\u00e9dures dans toute affaire :\n[\u2026]\n(b) lorsque, pour quelque autre raison, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice l\u2019exige.\n[34] Support for the application of paragraph 50(1)(b) to a stay of class proceedings is found in LaLiberte where, in the context of a carriage motion, the Federal Court ordered the stay of proposed class proceedings under the authority of section 50 of the Federal Courts Act and paragraph 105(b) of the Rules: LaLiberte FC Decision at para. 85.\n(2) Standard of Review [35] The motion judge\u2019s decisions were discretionary. The standards of review are correctness for questions of law; palpable and overriding error for questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law \u2014 unless there is an extricable error of law, in which case correctness applies: Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, 2016 FCA 215 at para. 79; Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 [Housen].\n(3) Did the motion judge err by failing to give due weight to the goals of class proceedings? [36] The appellant submits that a court must consider the goals of class proceedings in exercising the discretion under paragraph 50(1)(b) in the context of class proceedings. The goals of class proceedings are access to justice, judicial economy, and behaviour modification: Hollick v. Toronto (City), 2001 SCC 68 at para. 15 [Hollick]; L\u2019Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal v. J.J., 2019 SCC 35 at para. 6.\n[37] The failure to identify or consider the legal criteria that govern the exercise of discretion may constitute an error of law: Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748 at para. 39, 144 D.L.R. (4th) 1; British Columbia (Minister of Forests) v. Okanagan Indian Band, 2003 SCC 71 at para. 43. Here, the appellant appears not to take issue with the motion judge\u2019s statement of the test for a stay of proceedings under paragraph 50(1)(b) but says that the failure to give due weight to the goals of class proceedings was a palpable and overriding error.\n[38] For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the motion judge considered the goals of class proceedings as part of the contextual analysis. It is not for this Court to reweigh the factors considered by the motion judge. There is no reversible error.\n[39] A stay ordered under paragraph 50(1)(b) is a matter of broad discretion: Mylan Pharmaceuticals ULC v. AstraZeneca Canada, Inc., 2011 FCA 312 at para. 5 [Mylan]; Clayton v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 1 at para. 24 [Clayton].\n[40] In Mylan, this Court distinguished between situations where a court is asked to enjoin another body from exercising its jurisdiction and those where the court is asked not to exercise its own jurisdiction until later. For the former, the tripartite test established in RJR-Macdonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311, 111 D.L.R. (4th) 385 applies. For the latter, the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d test governs: Mylan at para. 5; Clayton at para. 24. Here, as Hudson and Pierrot were commenced in the Federal Court, the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d test applies.\n[41] Under the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d test, there is no exhaustive list of factors that must be considered. The relevant factors will be determined by the context in which the stay request arises: Mylan at para. 5; Coote v. Lawyers\u2019 Professional Indemnity Company, 2013 FCA 143 at para. 10 [Coote]; Clayton at para. 26.\n[42] This approach is consistent with decisions of other appellate courts concerning the stay of class proceedings. The exercise of discretion should not be curtailed by rigid criteria: Herold v. Wassermann, 2022 SKCA 103 at para. 98, citing Leier v. Shumiatcher (No. 2), 1962 CanLII 330 (S.K. C.A.) at para. 2, 39 W.W.R. (N.S.) 446; Hamm v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 ABCA 329 at para. 11.\n[43] While there are no \u201chard and fast rules\u201d applicable to the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d test (Richards v. Canada, 2021 FC 231 at para. 10), certain guiding principles are to be taken into account, including the overarching objective of securing the \u201cjust, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every proceeding on the merits\u201d: Rules, rule 3. This reflects the public interest in proceedings moving in an efficient, timely, and fair manner, and avoiding the wasteful use of judicial resources: Mylan at para. 5; Coote at para. 13; Clayton at para. 28.\n[44] Although a court need not apply the RJR-Macdonald test, it may take into account some of the same considerations: Clayton at paras. 26-28; Viterra Inc. v. Grain Workers\u2019 Union (International Longshoreman\u2019s Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Local 333), 2021 FCA 41 at para. 23. Ultimately, the motion judge must protect against unfair prejudice to either party: Coote at para. 13. This necessarily involves a balancing of the prejudice to the moving party if the stay is not granted and prejudice to the opposing party if the action is stayed.\n[45] I am satisfied that the motion judge took these principles into account. The motion judge acknowledged many of these authorities and cited others for guidance on the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d test: Reasons at para. 10. The principles were applied with due consideration to Hudson and Pierrot being proposed class actions and Greenwood and AMPMQ already being certified.\n[46] A presumption of prejudice arises where overlap of class proceedings in the same jurisdiction is established \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201cintra-jurisdictional multiplicity\u201d of proceedings. There is no need to separately prove prejudice, although the presumption can be displaced with evidence to the contrary: Reid v. Google LLC, 2022 BCSC 158 at para. 140 [Google BCSC Decision], aff\u2019d Kett v. Google LLC, 2023 BCCA 350 [Google BCCA Decision] (this point was not challenged on appeal).\n[47] The motion judge correctly identified that the appellant\u2019s submissions rested on its view that Hudson and Pierrot were duplicative of Greenwood and AMPMQ. Multiple proceedings, whether individual actions or class proceedings, that litigate the same issue are inefficient and expensive, cause delay in the administration of justice, and waste scarce judicial and other resources: Vaeth v. North American Palladium Ltd., 2016 ONSC 5015 at para. 37; Apotex Inc. v. Bayer Inc., 2020 FCA 86 at para. 45. They entail the possibility of inconsistent results and can be prejudicial to a defendant, forced to defend the same allegations on multiple fronts. The need to avoid a multiplicity of class proceedings must, however, always be balanced with the objective of access to justice: Jensen v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., 2019 FC 373 at para. 22.\n[48] The motion judge conducted a balancing exercise, reviewing the potential prejudice to each party. More particularly, the motion judge considered judicial economy, acknowledging that a stay could prevent unnecessary costly duplication of judicial and legal resources: Reasons at para. 13. The motion judge also took into account access to justice and potential prejudice to the plaintiffs, noting that a stay would potentially require Ms. Hudson to litigate her claims in a piecemeal fashion: Reasons at paras. 30-31. The motion judge considered the potential prejudice to the defendant in having to potentially defend the same allegations on different fronts: Reasons at para. 13. Contrary to the appellant\u2019s submission, the motion judge did consider the class action goals of judicial economy and access to justice.\n[49] This was appropriate in the circumstances. It is not for this Court to review the weight given to those class action goals or engage in a rebalancing of the factors considered by the motion judge.\n[50] The motion judge made no error in identifying and considering the relevant principles governing the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d test.\n(4) Did the motion judge err in characterizing the claims and conducting the duplication analysis? [51] Having identified the test for granting a stay, the motion judge proceeded to consider the key issue \u2014 whether the proceedings were duplicative.\n[52] The essence of the appellant\u2019s submissions was that the factual foundation and the issues in Hudson and Pierrot are duplicative of those in Greenwood and AMPMQ: Reasons at para. 13. The motion judge analyzed the degree of overlap between the proceedings, relying on the record, including the pleadings in all of the proceedings and the certification orders and decisions in Greenwood and AMPMQ.\n[53] The appellant and the interveners submit that the motion judge committed several errors in the duplication analysis, in the legal and factual characterization of the claims. For the reasons that follow, I disagree.\n[54] I pause to briefly address the challenges that underlie the duplication analysis. There are no indications in the Federal Courts Act or Rules of criteria to be considered in determining the overlap in class proceedings (whether proposed or certified, multi-jurisdictional or in the same jurisdiction). By contrast, section 1.1 of the Ontario Class Proceedings Act, 1992, S.O. 1992, c. 6 [OCPA] provides:\n1.1 A determination under this Act as to whether two or more proceedings involve the same or similar subject matter shall include consideration of whether the proceedings involve the same or similar causes of action and the same or affiliated defendants.\n1.1 Toute d\u00e9cision rendue en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi sur la question de savoir si deux instances ou plus concernent le m\u00eame objet ou un objet similaire tient compte de la question de savoir si les instances concernent les m\u00eames causes d\u2019action ou des causes d\u2019action similaires et les m\u00eames d\u00e9fendeurs ou des d\u00e9fendeurs associ\u00e9s.\n[55] Here, the issue is the potential overlap between two proposed class proceedings (Hudson and Pierrot) and two already certified class proceedings (Greenwood and AMPMQ). Although AMPMQ is a Quebec proceeding, the issue of competing class proceedings in multiple jurisdictions, and the related issue of which claim or forum should be preferred, do not arise. Other considerations apply where a court is asked to stay one class proceeding in favour of a class proceeding in another Canadian jurisdiction: for example, OCPA, subsections 5(6) and (7); Class Proceedings Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 50, subsections 4(3) and (4).\n[56] A recent decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal addressed a situation, analogous to this case, in which multiple claims against the same defendant making similar allegations were commenced in the same jurisdiction. The Court confirmed the correct test to be whether the proceedings are about \u201cthe same dispute or subject matter\u201d: Google BCCA Decision at para. 61. This approach centres on the overlap in the legal issues \/ causes of action and damages claimed, and the factual foundations of the proceedings (e.g., whether the claims involve the same or similar events or transactions). Put differently, do the proceedings \u201ctraverse the same factual ground, allege the same wrongdoing and claim for the same loss\u201d?: Google BCSC Decision at para. 156.\n[57] The motion judge\u2019s approach was consistent with this guidance \u2014 relying on the \u201cfocus\u201d of each proceeding to capture both the relevant legal issues \/ causes of action and the facts supporting the claims.\n[58] Additional factors to consider in the duplication analysis may include whether the proceedings have some or all of the same class members, class periods, and the same (or affiliated) defendants. Here, the defendants are the same. The motion judge determined that the proceedings were sufficiently different without considering the potential for overlap in class membership or class periods. The motion judge concluded that these class issues should be left for the certification judge: Reasons at para. 28.\n[59] The critical part of the duplication assessment lies in determining how much overlap can be tolerated in allowing multiple actions to proceed, keeping in mind other procedural tools to coordinate the prosecution of claims. A Venn diagram depicting shaded areas of intersection springs to mind.\n[60] One can readily accept the proposition that \u201c[t]here cannot be two or more certified class actions in the same jurisdiction representing the same class in relation to the same claim\u201d: Mancinelli v. Barrick Gold Corporation, 2016 ONCA 571 at para. 11; Workman Optometry et al. v. Aviva Insurance et al., 2021 ONSC 142 at para. 33. However, it will rarely be this straightforward.\n[61] The analysis will invariably be highly case-specific, involving a characterization of pleadings and factual determinations. Determining the essential nature of claims is a question of mixed fact and law, reviewable on the highly deferential standard of palpable and overriding error, absent an extricable error of law: Apotex Inc. v. Canada (Health), 2012 FCA 322 at para. 9, citing Housen; Buffalo v. Canada, 2016 FCA 223 at para. 42; Canada (Attorney General) v. Scow, 2022 BCCA 275 at para. 76 [Scow]. A motion judge is to be afforded a wide berth in the duplication analysis, given the context-specific nature of the inquiry.\n(a) Alleged error in law: conflating implicit with systemic discrimination [62] The appellant and the interveners claim that the motion judge erred in characterizing the claims in Hudson and Greenwood by incorrectly conflating \u201cimplicit\u201d with \u201csystemic\u201d discrimination and relying on a bright line distinction between implicit \/ systemic discrimination on the one hand and explicit acts of discrimination on the other. They say that this was an error in law warranting this Court\u2019s intervention. I disagree.\n[63] Read fairly, the motion judge\u2019s reasons do not conflate systemic discrimination with implicit discrimination. At paragraph 22, the motion judge concludes that \u201cthe factual basis of systemic racism in Hudson is based on implicit misconduct, policies, and procedures that do not require explicit actions in order to be discriminatory.\u201d The comment in paragraph 24 that the focus of Hudson is \u201csystemic racism, an implicit misconduct\u201d must be understood in light of that earlier finding and should be read as \u201csystemic racism, in this case, an implicit misconduct.\u201d\n[64] The motion judge determined that Hudson, at its core, focuses on systemic racism. The misconduct alleged was not being considered for promotion and receiving lower remuneration and worse training, education and mentorship than non-racialized colleagues. Although there were allegations of explicitly discriminatory conduct directed at Ms. Hudson, the focus was on implicit misconduct \u2014 the discriminatory impact resulting from a failure to have or enforce adequate procedures, policies and guidelines to protect against racism: Reasons at paras. 19, 22, 24, and 27. \u201cIn Hudson, the Plaintiff merely had to exist and have certain immutable characteristics to suffer the alleged discrimination\u201d: Reasons at para. 27.\n[65] The motion judge determined that this made Hudson distinct from Greenwood, which focuses on \u201cbullying, intimidation, and harassment\u201d, and AMPMQ, which focuses on \u201cabuse[s] of power\u201d \u2014 particularly in relation to French-speaking employees and those who exercised their freedom of association and right to unionize: Reasons at paras. 17-18. The motion judge concluded that Greenwood involved unwanted physical touching, retaliation for complaining and demeaning and belittling comments. \u201cThe misconducts complained of in Greenwood were because an individual committed an act, such as filing a complaint or report\u201d: Reasons at para. 27. The motion judge concluded that there was no indication that systemic racism would be dealt with in Greenwood: Reasons at para. 29.\n[66] The motion judge used the terms \u201cexplicit\u201d and \u201cimplicit\u201d to differentiate between the types of misconduct alleged in Hudson and Pierrot on the one hand and Greenwood and AMPMQ on the other. This was part of an analysis of the factual foundation \u2014 the types of events giving rise to the claims in each proceeding. The terms were not used to underpin the motion judge\u2019s conclusion about the legal basis for the claims. The motion judge determined that the focuses of the claims were different \u2014 systemic racism or discrimination in Hudson and Pierrot, bullying, intimidation and harassment in Greenwood, and abuses of power in AMPMQ.\n[67] There is no error warranting this Court\u2019s intervention.\n(b) Alleged error in law: characterizing Greenwood and AMPMQ too narrowly [68] The appellant and the interveners acknowledge that the characterization of pleadings is usually a question of mixed fact and law. However, they submit that the motion judge erred in law by characterizing the claims in Greenwood and AMPMQ more narrowly than in the certification orders and decisions rendered by this Court and the Federal Court in Greenwood and by the Superior Court of Quebec in AMPMQ. They say that the impugned behaviour of the RCMP in each of Hudson, Pierrot, Greenwood, and AMPMQ stems from systemic negligence; the causes of action are the same. I disagree.\n[69] First, I do not accept that there is an extricable question of law. It is well-established that certification is not a determination of the merits of claims in a class proceeding: Hollick at para. 16; Pro\u2011Sys Consultants Ltd. v. Microsoft Corporation, 2013 SCC 57 at para. 99; Bowman v. Ontario, 2022 ONCA 477 at para. 37. Certification simply means that the action is appropriately prosecuted as a class proceeding: Hollick at para. 16.\n[70] The fact that the certification decisions or orders in Greenwood and AMPMQ contain descriptions of the claims in those proceedings does not change the nature of the characterization process undertaken by the motion judge. That remains a determination of mixed fact and law, based on the record.\n[71] Second, I do not accept the appellant and interveners\u2019 characterization of all four proceedings as being about \u201csystemic negligence\u201d or breaches of \u201ca duty of care to provide a non-injurious environment.\u201d This overly broad characterization ignores important differences that the motion judge identified and that find support in the statements of claim and the certification orders and decisions in Greenwood and AMPMQ.\n[72] The motion judge referred to the certification orders in Greenwood and AMPMQ. The motion judge cited the description of claims in the Greenwood certification order and then elaborated, based on a review of the pleadings, why the allegations in Hudson and Pierrot were not covered by Greenwood and AMPMQ: Reasons at paras. 3-8 and 16-19. There was ample support for this conclusion.\n[73] The Hudson amended statement of claim states that the action concerns systemic racism, and under the heading \u201cSystemic Negligence\u201d claims that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff and class members to ensure that they could work in an environment free of racism. Each particularized aspect of the duty of care is about racism and measures to protect or mitigate against the harmful effects of racism.\n[74] In contrast, the Greenwood statement of claim states that the action concerns systemic bullying, intimidation and harassment. The pleading refers to the statutory and institutional barriers, including the \u201cparamilitary structure\u201d of the RCMP that prevented collective bargaining and other means of obtaining meaningful redress for grievances. The particulars of the bullying, intimidation and harassment include sexually explicit comments; unwanted physical and\/or sexual exposure or touching; demeaning or belittling comments made about sexual orientation and to or about First Nations individuals, other non-Caucasian individuals, and those suffering from mental health issues; and retaliation against those who complained or reported bullying, intimidation or harassment.\n[75] While not mentioned in the motion judge\u2019s reasons, the common issues in the certification orders for Greenwood and AMPMQ and those proposed in Hudson further support the motion judge\u2019s determination. In Greenwood, the first common issue is: \u201cDid the RCMP \u2026 owe a duty of care to take reasonable steps in the operation or management of the Force to provide [class members] with a work environment free from bullying, intimidation and harassment?\u201d\n[76] In AMPMQ, the first common issue is: \u201cWere the RCMP and its staff obligated to respect the rights of the members under the Charters and to provide a workplace exempt from Abuse of power, including protection on the basis of belonging to the language group of French locutors or of their militancy in favour of freedom of association or the right to unionize?\u201d\n[77] In Hudson, a proposed common issue is: \u201cWas the \u2026 RCMP obligated to respect the Plaintiff and Class Members\u2019 rights under [the Charters] and to provide a workplace free from discrimination on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, colour and religion?\u201d\n[78] I find no error in the motion judge\u2019s approach to assessing the overlap in claims based on the \u201cfocus\u201d of each proceeding, as this included a consideration of both the causes of action and the underlying factual foundation in each of the proceedings. This approach finds support in the class actions context, where the issue has been described as whether proceedings involve the \u201csame dispute or subject matter\u201d: Google BCCA Decision at paras. 61-62. The approach also finds support in other contexts, where in characterizing claims, courts have determined that what matters is the \u201cessential character\u201d, based on realistic appreciation of the practical result sought by the plaintiff: JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc. v. Canada (National Revenue), 2013 FCA 250 at para. 50; Scow at para. 75; Weber v. Ontario Hydro, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 929 at para. 49, 24 O.R. (3d) 358; Roitman v. Canada, 2006 FCA 266 at para. 16 (all concerning jurisdiction); and Manuge v. Canada, 2010 SCC 67 at para. 19 (whether a proceeding should be brought as a judicial review application rather than an action).\n[79] The fact that the claims in Hudson and Greenwood both plead systemic negligence is not an answer to the duplication analysis. Two claims may plead systemic negligence in respect of the same organization, yet nonetheless be legally and factually distinct based on the different duties and standards of care and alleged breaches. As the motion judge concluded, Greenwood alleges a duty to provide a workplace free from bullying, intimidation and harassment; Hudson and Pierrot allege a duty to provide a workplace free from systemic racism.\n[80] It was open to the motion judge to conclude that the focus of the claims in Hudson and Pierrot differed from the focus of the claims in Greenwood and AMPMQ. There was no error in law in characterizing the claims.\n(c) Alleged error in the factual characterization of the pleadings [81] The appellant submits that the motion judge erred in distinguishing the factual basis for Hudson (and Pierrot) from the factual bases for Greenwood and AMPMQ. It says that Hudson (and Pierrot), like Greenwood and AMPMQ, involves allegations of explicit or overt acts of discrimination based on race. It also says that Greenwood and AMPMQ encompass workplace discrimination allegations, including systemic acts and omissions based on race. The appellant submits that the motion judge\u2019s errors were palpable and overriding.\n[82] Under the highly deferential standard of palpable and overriding error, appellate intervention is warranted only where an error is both obvious and determinative of the outcome: Salomon v. Matte-Thompson, 2019 SCC 14 at para. 33 [Salomon]; Mahjoub v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FCA 157 at paras. 61-75 [Mahjoub]. An appellate court must not reweigh the evidence that was before the motion judge and exercise discretion afresh: Salomon at para. 40; Mahjoub at paras. 70-79.\n[83] In my view, the appellant and the interveners have not identified an error that is obvious and \u201cgoes to the very core of the outcome of the case\u201d: Benhaim v. St\u2011Germain, 2016 SCC 48 at para. 38, citing Canada v. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 FCA 165. The motion judge\u2019s reasons, although brief, address the key differences between the factual foundations in Greenwood, AMPMQ, and Hudson and Pierrot and are supported by the record.\n[84] As discussed earlier in these reasons, the motion judge concluded that the factual foundation in Greenwood was explicit misconduct \u2014 bullying, intimidation and harassment in the form of unwanted touching, sexual exposure, belittling and demeaning comments. These misconducts occurred in retaliation for action taken by an individual, such as filing a complaint or report: Reasons at paras. 17 and 27. Although the allegations of harassment in Greenwood might include situations of race-based discrimination, the motion judge concluded that this was not the focus of the Greenwood proceeding; there was little mention of racism and no mention of systemic racism in Greenwood: Reasons at para. 24.\n[85] The motion judge acknowledged that Hudson included allegations of explicit misconduct but concluded that the factual foundation in Hudson was implicit misconduct \u2014 the failure to have or enforce adequate policies, procedures and guidelines to minimize the risk of being subjected to racism. The plaintiff suffered the consequences because she had \u201ccertain immutable characteristics\u201d that resulted in the discrimination: Reasons at paras. 19 and 27.\n[86] The motion judge\u2019s determination of the factual foundation of the proceedings and the areas of overlap are owed deference. No palpable and overriding error has been established. There is no basis for this Court to intervene.\n(5) Conclusion [87] There are potential areas of intersection between the proceedings \u2014 for example, between the claims in Hudson \/ Pierrot and Greenwood, for certain class members and periods, in the area of harassment based on race, and between Hudson \/ Pierrot and AMPMQ, in the area of harassment and discrimination based on race towards individuals with a connection to Quebec.\n[88] The motion judge recognized that the claims in Hudson \/ Pierrot and those in Greenwood \/ AMPMQ were not completely distinct: Reasons at paras. 16 and 30-31. However, the motion judge concluded that the areas of overlap did not outweigh the differences and declined to exercise the discretion to permanently stay Hudson and Pierrot. I see no error in that decision.\n[89] Greenwood and AMPMQ have been certified, but Hudson and Pierrot have not. The identifiable class and common questions remain to be determined in the latter proceedings. The motion judge made a discretionary decision in this context and, appropriately, exercised caution.\n[90] The motion judge observed that some of the duplication arguments made by the appellant were better left to the certification judge: Reasons at para. 28. At a certification hearing for Hudson, the Court will be required to address the concerns raised by the appellant in these appeals, including whether Hudson would involve claims that are the subject of any other proceeding: Rules, subsection 334.16(2).\n[91] In the context of a certification hearing, with additional information about the identifiable class(es), representative plaintiffs and common questions, the Court will be in a better position to assess the degree of overlap in the proceedings. At that time, the Court could consider whether a stay is warranted, if sought by the appellant, and other procedural tools available to limit potentially adverse consequences arising from the overlap.\n[92] As acknowledged at the hearing, there may be alternatives less draconian than a stay, including case management, that preserve a role for all of the plaintiffs, allowing the actions to advance without duplication. The Hudson claim already explicitly excludes any claims class members have in Greenwood (unless Greenwood is decertified) and in Delisle (AMPMQ) (unless Delisle (AMPMQ) is de-authorized), addressing the intersection of the Hudson claims with each of the Greenwood and AMPMQ claims. At or prior to a certification hearing in Hudson, these alternatives could be further pursued.\nVI.

(PCS) was entitled, in computing its income for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (the Act) for its taxation years 1999 to 2002, to deduct base payments paid to the province of Saskatchewan under The Mineral Taxation Act, 1983, S.S. 1983-84, c. M-17.1 (MTA) and The Potash Production Tax Schedule (PPTS) to the MTA.\n[2] The Tax Court of Canada (per Justice Owen, 2022 TCC 75) found that PCS was not entitled to deduct these base payments in computing its income for the taxation years under appeal.\n[3] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss this appeal.\nI. Background [4] The PPTS imposed a tax on potash produced from any lands in Saskatchewan that was sold or otherwise disposed of. There were two components of the tax: a base payment and a profit tax. Only the base payment is in issue in this appeal.\n[5] Section 5 of the PPTS set out the formula used to determine the amount of the base payment. The base payment was the rate of tax determined in accordance with the PPTS multiplied by the number of tonnes of potash sold or otherwise disposed of, minus certain permitted deductions (subsection 5(2) of the PPTS).\n[6] The rate of tax was based on a prescribed percentage of the profits for a particular year divided by the number of tonnes of potash sold or otherwise disposed of in that year (subsection 5(3) of the PPTS). The PPTS prescribed a maximum and a minimum rate of tax (subsections 5(4) and 5(5) of the PPTS). To determine whether the rate of tax for PCS for a particular year fell within or outside the range between the minimum and maximum rate of tax, PCS determined the prescribed percentage of its profits for that year and then divided this amount by the number of tonnes of potash that it sold in that year. The rate of tax for PCS as calculated in accordance with the formula for each year under appeal exceeded the maximum rate of tax as prescribed. Therefore, the maximum rate of tax prescribed by the PPTS was used as the rate of tax for each year.\n[7] PCS paid the following base payments for the years under appeal:\nTaxation Year\nBase Payment\n1999\n$14,643,226\n2000\n$16,454,834\n2001\n$14,673,344\n2002\n$13,655,538\n[8] PCS did not claim a deduction for the base payments in filing its tax returns for the years under appeal. Following the decision of the Tax Court in Cogema Resources Inc. v The Queen, 2004 TCC 750 (Cogema) (which was affirmed on appeal (2005 FCA 316)), PCS requested a reduction in its income to reflect the base payments. This request was refused by the Minister of National Revenue (the Minister), which resulted in the appeal that was heard by the Tax Court.\nII. Decision of the Tax Court [9] PCS argued before the Tax Court that it was entitled to deduct the base payments in computing its profit for the purposes of subsection 9(1) of the Act and that neither paragraph 18(1)(a) nor paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act applied to deny this deduction. If either paragraph 18(1)(a) or paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act applied to deny this deduction, that would have been sufficient to dismiss PCS\u2019 appeal.\n[10] Paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act is a general prohibition on claiming a deduction for an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made for the purpose of earning income:\n18 (1) In computing the income of a taxpayer from a business or property no deduction shall be made in respect of\n18 (1) Dans le calcul du revenu du contribuable tir\u00e9 d\u2019une entreprise ou d\u2019un bien, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants ne sont pas d\u00e9ductibles :\n(a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from the business or property;\na) les d\u00e9penses, sauf dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es ou effectu\u00e9es par le contribuable en vue de tirer un revenu de l\u2019entreprise ou du bien;\n[11] The Tax Court Judge found that the deduction of the base payments was denied pursuant to paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act because either:\n(a)the base payment was a tax \u201con the income of a producer from sales or other dispositions of potash mined in Saskatchewan\u201d (paragraph 72 of his reasons); or\n(b)\u201cthe base payment is not incurred by [PCS] for the purpose of gaining or producing income from its potash mining business; rather, it is a tax that is applied only after the conclusion of the process of earning income from that business\u201d (paragraph 73 of his reasons).\n[12] Paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act was repealed in 2003, effective for taxation years that began after 2007. For the purposes of this appeal, paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act would have prohibited the deduction by PCS of the base payment if the base payment could reasonably have been considered to be in relation to the production of potash by PCS. Paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act was amended during the taxation years under appeal. The full text of the two versions of paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act that were applicable during the taxation years under appeal are set out in paragraphs 75 and 76 of the Tax Court Judge\u2019s reasons.\n[13] Although it was not necessary to consider whether paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act applied, the Tax Court Judge summarizes his conclusion that the base payment was made in relation to the production of potash:\n[86] I similarly have no difficulty concluding that a \u201csale or other disposition of\u201d potash is an activity that relates to the production of that potash. There is a direct and immediate connection between the production of potash and the subsequent sale or disposition of that potash. To find otherwise would be to ignore the commercial objective of any mining venture, which is to mine and produce minerals to obtain the value of those minerals through sale, consumption, or use. The fact that the base payment arises after a sale or other disposition of potash does not preclude it being in relation to the production of that potash.\n[14] As a result, the Tax Court dismissed the appeal of PCS.\nIII. Issue and Standard of Review [15] The issues raised by PCS in this appeal are:\n(a)whether paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act precluded PCS from deducting the base payments in computing its income; and\n(b)whether paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act precluded PCS from deducting the base payments in computing its income.\n[16] PCS is not challenging any findings of fact made by the Tax Court Judge. The only issue is the interpretation of these provisions of the Act. As a result, the standard of review is correctness (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33).\nIV. Analysis [17] In order for PCS to be successful in this appeal, it would be necessary to find that neither paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act nor paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act prohibited the deduction of the base payments by PCS.\n[18] As noted above, paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act is a general limitation that restricts a deduction for an outlay or expense to the amount thereof that was made or incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income from a business or property. If the base payments were not made or incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income from the business being carried on by PCS, then they cannot be deducted in computing the income of PCS.\n[19] The formula to calculate the base payment was the rate of tax multiplied by the quantity of potash sold or otherwise disposed of (subsection 5(2) of the PPTS). While the PPTS prescribed a minimum rate of tax (and therefore, even if there was no profit, there would still be a rate of tax), there was no prescribed minimum quantity of potash sold or otherwise disposed of. If no potash was sold or otherwise disposed of in a particular year, there would be no base payment for that year.\n[20] Therefore, in order to incur the base payment, PCS had to sell or otherwise dispose of potash. As noted by the Tax Court Judge (at paragraph 6 of his reasons), PCS only produced potash for sale. The witness for PCS at the Tax Court hearing also confirmed that the base payment was calculated based on the quantity of potash that was sold. As a result, the base payment was only incurred by PCS as a result of a sale of potash by PCS. There was no \u201cother disposition\u201d of potash by PCS.\n[21] Since the issue in this appeal is whether PCS can deduct the base payment in determining its income for the purposes of the Act, what resulted in the base payment being incurred by PCS is relevant. The application of the base payment to a different taxpayer, who may have incurred the base payment as a result of some other event that would be considered to be a disposition for the purposes of the PPTS, is not relevant in determining whether PCS is entitled to the deduction. The tax consequences to PCS are to be determined based on what PCS did that resulted in it incurring the base payment. As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Shell Canada Ltd. v. Canada, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 622, 4 C.T.C. 313, at paragraph 45:\nUnless the Act provides otherwise, a taxpayer is entitled to be taxed based on what it actually did, not based on what it could have done, and certainly not based on what a less sophisticated taxpayer might have done.\n[22] PCS labels as \u201cred herrings\u201d the Tax Court Judge\u2019s focus on the base payment only being incurred on a sale of potash and the requirement to use the profit of PCS to determine if the rate of tax would be the minimum tax rate, the maximum tax rate or somewhere in between. PCS argues that it could not carry on business if it did not pay the base payment.\n[23] However, the argument that not paying the base payment could result in PCS not being able to continue to carry on its business is based on the consequences of not paying the base payment, and not on whether the base payment was incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income. The same argument concerning the consequences of failing to pay the base payment could also be made with respect to provincial income taxes. If a person were to not pay provincial income taxes incurred as a result of carrying on a business, the particular province may well commence collection actions, which could result in the closure of the business.\n[24] However, there is no dispute that provincial income taxes are not deductible in computing income for the purposes of the Act. In Roenisch v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue - M.N.R.) (1930), [1931] Ex.C.R. 1, at page 4, [1931] 2 D.L.R. 90, (Roenisch) Justice Audette stated:\nIt is self-evident that the amount of the income tax paid to the province is not an expense for the purpose of earning the income, within the meaning of 6a [now paragraph 18(1)(a)]. When such payment of taxes is made to the province, it is not so made to earn the income, it is paid because there is an income showing gain and profit.\n[25] This argument that the failure to pay a tax that could lead to the possible consequence of losing a business is not sufficient, in and of itself, to establish that the base payment was incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income.\n[26] PCS, in paragraph 47 of its memorandum, submits that the Tax Court should have considered the following paragraph from Roenisch, [1931] Ex.C.R. 1, at page 5:\nAs was said, in the case of The Crown v. D. and W. Murray Ltd. [(1909) 11 W.A. Law Reports 92, at p. 95], the remarks made by Sir Henry James, when Attorney-General, in the case of Last v. London Assurance Corporation [(1885) 10 A.C. 438], apply to the present case. He says:\nThe test is this \u2015 if there is an expenditure which would be made in any case, from which profits may accrue, the expenditure may be deducted; but an expenditure which will not be incurred unless there is a profit is not an expenditure in order to earn a profit.\n[emphasis was added by PCS in its memorandum]\n[27] PCS, in addressing this test in its memorandum, does not refer to the first part of the test which described \u201can expenditure which would be made in any case, from which profits may accrue\u201d. Therefore, PCS does not address how income or profits could accrue from making the base payment.\n[28] Instead, PCS focuses on the obligation to pay the base payment even if PCS did not realize a profit (because the PPTS prescribed a minimum rate of tax). There are two responses to this argument.\n[29] First, this argument does not take into account the second component of the formula to determine the amount of the base payment. The base payment is the rate of tax multiplied by the number of tonnes of potash sold or otherwise disposed of. PCS only incurred the base payment because it sold potash, which resulted in income being gained. If PCS did not sell any potash, then no base payment would be incurred.\n[30] The second response to PCS\u2019 argument related to Roenisch is that the argument appears to equate income with profit for the purposes of paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act. However, paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act refers to income. The word profit does not appear in this paragraph. The test under paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act is whether the base payment was made or incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income. Therefore, the meaning of \u201cincome\u201d for the purposes of paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act is relevant.\n[31] In Ludco Enterprises Ltd. v. Canada, 2001 SCC 62, the Supreme Court noted that the Act does not define \u201cincome\u201d:\n[57] The Income Tax Act does not define the term \u201cincome\u201d. The Act speaks of \u201cnet income\u201d, \u201ctaxable income\u201d, and income from different sources, but it neither identifies nor describes the legal characteristics of \u201cincome\u201d; it only speaks of what is to be included or excluded from income. Similarly, tax theorists have proposed many different definitions of \u201cincome\u201d distinguishable by their varying degrees of inclusiveness. The common feature of all the definitions of income, whether derived from tax law, economic theory or the dictionary, is that \u201cincome\u201d is a measure of gain: see V. Krishna, The Fundamentals of Canadian Income Tax (6th ed. 2000), at pp. 97-100.\n[32] The Supreme Court concluded, at paragraph 61, that \u201cincome\u201d, for the purposes of paragraph 20(1)(c) of the Act, \u201cdoes not refer to net income, but to income subject to tax. In this light, it is clear that \u2018income\u2019 in s. 20(1)(c)(i) refers to income generally, that is, an amount that would come into income for taxation purposes, not just net income\u201d.\n[33] In Novopharm Ltd. v. Canada, 2003 FCA 112, Justice Rothstein, writing on behalf of this Court, concluded that the comments of the Supreme Court in Ludco applied equally to the meaning of \u201cincome\u201d in paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act:\n[20] The Minister submits that paragraph 18(1)(a) is generally aimed at deductions of outlays which are not profit motivated. However, I think the rationale outlined by Iacobucci J. in Ludco, as to why income in subparagraph 20(1)(c)(i) is not equivalent to profit or net income, is equally applicable to paragraph 18(1)(a). Nowhere in the language of paragraph 18(1)(a) is a quantitative test suggested. Nor is there any support in the words of paragraph 18(1)(a) that suggests a judicial assessment of the sufficiency of income. And, as with subparagraph 20(1)(c)(i), such an assessment would be too subjective where certainty is to be preferred. For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the view of Pigeon J. in Lipson, supra, to the extent that it may have been applied to paragraph 18(1)(a), must now be considered to have been superseded by the rationale in Ludco.\n[34] Therefore, \u201cincome\u201d, for the purposes of paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act, does not mean \u201cprofit\u201d or \u201cnet income\u201d. Rather, \u201cincome\u201d, for the purposes of paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act, means an amount that would be included in computing income for the purposes of the Act. As a result, in applying the test adopted by the Exchequer Court in Roenisch (\u201can expenditure which will not be incurred unless there is a profit is not an expenditure in order to earn a profit\u201d) to paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act, the references to \u201cprofit\u201d must be read as \u201cincome\u201d. The test would then be:\n\u2026 if there is an expenditure which would be made in any case, from which [income] may accrue, the expenditure may be deducted; but an expenditure which will not be incurred unless there is [income] is not an expenditure in order to earn [income].\n[35] For PCS, the base payment was an expenditure that would not have been incurred unless it sold potash, which produced income. The base payment was therefore not an expenditure in order to earn income.\n[36] PCS refers to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Harrods (Buenos Aires), Ltd. v. Taylor-Gooby (Inspector of Taxes) (1964), 41 T.C. 450, 43 A.T.C. 6 (CA). In that case, Harrods (Buenos Aires), Ltd. (Harrods) was incorporated in the United Kingdom and carried on business in Argentina. Argentina imposed a tax on the capital of corporations that carried on business in Argentina through an \u201cempresa estable\u201d. The premises where Harrods carried on its business was an \u201cempresa estable\u201d. The tax was paid regardless of whether the corporation earned a profit.\n[37] All three judges of the Court of Appeal, in separate reasons, agreed that the tax was deductible by Harrods in computing its income for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (UK), 1952, 15 & 16 Geo VI & I Eliz II, c. 10. Wilmer, L.J., stated at page 466:\nIt was the establishment of the \u201cempresa estable\u201d which attracted the tax, which was payable regardless of whether profits were, in fact, made \u2026 Liability to the tax in the present case was an incident to the establishment of the Company's \u201cempresa estable\u201d, and as such it was a liability incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade carried on there.\n[38] Harrods\u2019 liability to pay the tax did not arise on the sale of any products, but rather simply by having the establishment in Argentina. Diplock, L.J. confirmed the significance of the imposition of the tax in Argentina as a result of Harrods having an establishment there (at page 469):\nLiability to the tax does not depend upon whether profits are made or not. It is a payment which the company is compelled to make if it has a business establishment in the Argentine at all, and it must have a business establishment if it is to carry on its trade.\n[39] The tax was imposed in Argentina as a result of Harrods simply having an establishment in that country. Therefore, there is a significant distinction between the tax under consideration in Harrods (Buenos Aires), Ltd. v. Taylor-Gooby (Inspector of Taxes) and the base payment imposed by the Province of Saskatchewan. While in both cases the tax is imposed regardless of whether the taxpayer has a profit, the triggering event for the imposition of the tax in Argentina was the establishment of a store in Argentina by Harrods. In this appeal, the triggering event is not the establishment of a mine in Saskatchewan, but the sale of potash. PCS gained or produced its income by selling potash. The base payment was not incurred for the purpose of making the sale of potash; rather, it was incurred as a consequence of the sale of potash.\n[40] PCS also argues that Cogema confirms that a tax on the value of potash sold is deductible. In Cogema, the amounts in issue were paid under The Corporation Capital Tax Act (Saskatchewan), S.S. 1979-80 c. C-38.1 (the surcharge). The surcharge in Cogema was imposed on the value of the sales of uranium yellowcake. As noted by the Tax Court Judge, at paragraph 6, \u201c[t]he surcharge was not paid at the time of production of the ore or of the yellowcake. It was paid at the time of sale of that yellowcake\u201d.\n[41] The only provision of the Act that was in issue in Cogema was paragraph 18(1)(m). In particular, the issue was whether the surcharge was paid in relation to the production of minerals. The Tax Court Judge found that the surcharge was in relation to the sale of minerals and not the production of minerals:\n[15] \u2026 the surcharge related to Cogema\u2019s actual sale of the mineral and not its right to remove the mineral from the ground. The surcharge was a sales tax and was in relation to the sale of minerals, not the production of minerals.\n[42] Paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act was not considered by the Tax Court in Cogema. The Tax Court Judge simply referred the matter back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment. The Tax Court Judge did not state that the amounts in issue were deductible in computing Cogema\u2019s income:\n[16] The appeals are allowed and these matters are referred back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment pursuant to these Reasons.\n[43] In dismissing the appeal in Cogema, this Court provided brief reasons supporting the conclusion that the surcharge was a tax in relation to the sale of minerals and not the production of minerals:\n[1] We have not been persuaded that the amounts paid by the respondent pursuant to the Corporation Capital Tax Act of Saskatchewan (the Saskatchewan Act) in respect of which the respondent sought a deduction under the Income Tax Act constitute amounts that may reasonably be regarded as being in relation to the production in Canada of minerals.\n[2] Rather, we agree with Beaubier J., that the amounts paid by the respondent to the Province of Saskatchewan under the Saskatchewan Act were taxes in relation to sales of minerals and not the production of minerals.\n[44] Since in Cogema neither the Tax Court nor this Court considered paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act, Cogema does not assist in determining whether a tax in relation to the sale of minerals was incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income.\n[45] In this appeal, PCS gained or produced income by selling potash. The base payments were imposed based on the quantity of potash sold by PCS in a particular year. The base payments were not made or incurred for the purpose of making any sale of potash, but rather as a consequence of making such sale. Hence, the base payments were not made or incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income but rather as a result of PCS gaining or producing income by selling potash.\n[46] Since paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act results in a denial of the deduction in issue, there is no need to consider whether paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act would also have denied such deduction.\n[47] As a result, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\u201cWyman W.

The undertaking applies automatically and until the information is used in open court or is otherwise made public: Juman v. Doucette, 2008 SCC 8; Fibrogen, Inc. v. Akebia Therapeutics, Inc., 2022 FCA 135. However, the Court may relieve against the undertaking if the applicant demonstrates that the interests of justice served by doing so outweigh the values the implied undertaking is intended to protect: Juman at paras. 32-34.\n[2] The appellant, Iris Technologies Inc., commenced an appeal in the Tax Court of Canada. The Tax Court appointed a case management judge before whom the appellant brought a motion seeking confirmation that the implied undertaking did not apply to seven documents the respondent provided. If it did apply, the appellant sought relief from it.\n[3] The Tax Court judge dismissed the motion for reasons delivered orally on November 18, 2022. The appellant appeals that decision asserting that the judge erred in concluding that the implied undertaking applied. If he did not so err, says the appellant, he erred in failing to grant the appellant relief.\n[4] As it did before the Tax Court judge, the appellant argues here that the respondent was not compelled to produce the documents. The Tax Court judge disagreed, finding the respondent provided them \u201cpursuant to the Appellant\u2019s Notice to Attend served under the rules\u201d which \u201cplaced an obligation on the Respondent to produce the seven documents\u201d such that they were produced \u201cin the course of the Discovery process\u201d. The Tax Court judge found no exception applied. The record fully supports these conclusions. See also Fibrogen at paras. 53-59.\n[5] We see no merit to the appellant\u2019s submission that the Tax Court judge\u2019s findings \u2013 regarding the appellant\u2019s purpose in requesting the documents \u2013 were made without evidence. There is ample evidence in the record to support those findings.\n[6] Finally, the appellant submits the Tax Court judge erred in law in not granting it relief from the implied undertaking. The error, says the appellant, is not a failure to balance the required interests, but a failure to follow jurisprudence the appellant describes as \u201cdispositive\u201d of the interest that prevails in this case.\n[7] We cannot agree with the appellant\u2019s characterization of that jurisprudence which, as the Tax Court judge observed, was not binding on the Tax Court. Moreover, a court must always balance the relevant interests in context with reference to the particular facts: Juman at para. 32; Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of the Province of British Columbia v. Engineer X, 2023 BCCA 211 at paras. 27-28. Accordingly, the result of the balancing exercise in another case is not determinative.\n[8] We add that the appellant has not established a present need for the information covered by the implied undertaking in another proceeding that is actively being prosecuted.\n[9] We agree with the parties that the appellate standard of review applies to this appeal: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33. Having regard to that standard, and having carefully reviewed the record and considered the appellant\u2019s submissions, we see no error warranting our intervention. Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal with costs in the all-inclusive agreed amount of $3,000.\n\"K.A.

RAFIQUE\nAppellant\nand\nMINISTER OF NATIONAL REVENUE\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\n(Delivered from the Bench at Toronto, Ontario, on February 28, 2024).\nBIRINGER J.A.\n[1] The appellant, Ehtesham Rafique, appeals an interlocutory order of the Tax Court (per Rossiter C.J.). The appellant brought a motion to strike the Minister\u2019s reply and have the income tax assessments for his 1994 and 1995 years vacated. The Tax Court dismissed the motion, providing oral reasons.\n[2] The standards of review for the Tax Court\u2019s decision are those in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33: correctness for questions of law, and palpable and overriding error for questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law where there is no extricable legal error: Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, 2016 FCA 215 at para. 79; Canada v. Preston, 2023 FCA 178 at para. 12. A palpable and overriding error is an error that is obvious and determinative of the outcome: Salomon v. Matte-Thompson, 2019 SCC 14 at para. 33; Mahjoub v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FCA 157 at paras. 61-75.\n[3] On the motion, the appellant asked for a writ of mandamus, a remedy that the Tax Court correctly determined it had no jurisdiction to grant: Canada v. Dow Chemical Canada ULC, 2022 FCA 70 at para. 89; Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, subsection 18(1). However, the Tax Court judge appropriately looked beyond that request to consider the substance of the appellant\u2019s motion, which was to have the assessments vacated. The Tax Court concluded that there was no basis to do so.\n[4] The appellant submits that the Tax Court judge made errors in law in rendering the decision, by failing to admit certain evidence on the motion, by relying on certain cases regarding rule 170.1 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure), SOR\/90-688a, which the appellant views as distinguishable, and by refusing to decide on the motion the substantive issues in the tax appeal. We find these submissions to be without merit.\n[5] The Tax Court judge considered whether rule 170.1 applied. As this Court explained in Georgeson Shareholder Communications Canada Inc. v. Canada, 2020 FCA 139 at para. 9, rule 170.1 allows a party to apply for judgment at any stage in a proceeding where \u201cthere is nothing in controversy, either regarding the facts or a fairly arguable legal issue.\u201d It may apply, for example, where there has been an admission in the pleadings.\n[6] The appellant had argued that the Minister\u2019s alleged admission of failing to reconsider the appellant\u2019s assessment \u201cwith all due dispatch\u201d following a notice of objection (as required by subsection 165(3) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.)) warranted the assessments being vacated. The Tax Court judge disagreed, relying on applicable case law.\n[7] We agree with this conclusion. As this Court has confirmed, the Minister\u2019s failure to act \u201cwith all due dispatch\u201d is not a basis for overturning an assessment; the taxpayer\u2019s remedy is to appeal directly to the Tax Court under paragraph 169(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act: Ford v. Canada, 2014 FCA 257 at para. 19, citing Bolton v. The Queen, [1996] 3 C.T.C 3, 200 N.R. 303.\n[8] The Tax Court judge rejected the appellant\u2019s other arguments to have the assessments vacated, finding that there were still several issues in controversy in the tax appeal with respect to the deductibility of expenses and the imposition of late filing penalties. While commenting on the appellant\u2019s arguments on the latter, the Tax Court judge determined that these factual and legal issues were not to be determined on an interlocutory motion but at trial. There, the relevant evidence can be weighed, the Minister\u2019s assumptions challenged, and the legal issues resolved. We see no reviewable error in this conclusion.\n[9] The appellant\u2019s reliance in this Court on rules 167 and 169 as authority for the Tax Court judge to rule on the substantive issues is entirely misplaced. Those rules address the process by which judgments of the Tax Court are issued and do not provide for the disposition of an appeal on an interlocutory motion.\n[10] We find no error warranting this Court\u2019s intervention. Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal, with costs.\n\u201cMonica Biringer\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nEHTESHAM A RAFIQUE v.

The Federal Court dismissed the appellants\u2019 motion for injunctive relief and for an order extending earlier orders of the Federal Court that imposed confidentiality and a publication ban.\n[2] These matters stem from preliminary findings and recommendations made by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c. 5 concerning the appellants\u2019 handling of personal information. These preliminary findings and recommendations were expressed in the Commissioner\u2019s preliminary report and a later letter revising some aspects of the report and advising of his decision to publish the final report.\n[3] The appellants have applied for judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The appellants brought the motion, now before us, within that judicial review. The appellants argued that the Commissioner needed to be enjoined from publishing his findings and recommendations. They argued that without injunctive relief, their reputation would be irreparably harmed and their judicial review would be rendered moot.\n[4] Applying the classic test for injunctive relief in RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311, the Federal Court found that the appellants had failed to establish irreparable harm with the evidence they adduced. The evidence was general, broad, unparticularized, unspecific, and relatively sparse\u2014in short, insufficient and inadequate and, thus, well short of the mark. The Federal Court added that the appellants \u201cdid not offer any evidence to establish that such public exposure [as a result of the disclosure of the Commissioner\u2019s final report would have]\u2026 an impact on their business in a manner that would take it outside the normal impact of the Commissioner\u2019s proceedings\u201d (at para. 48). In other words, there was evidence of harm but the evidence was of such generality and non-specificity that it was not possible to infer or conclude that the harm would be irreparable.\n[5] From that, the Federal Court concluded that the appellants failed to establish harm of sufficient quality or weight to show that the balance of convenience was in their favour. The Federal Court added that the pursuit of the Commissioner\u2019s mandate was very much in the public interest and that weighed heavily against the appellants in any assessment of the balance of convenience.\n[6] Applying the standards governing court openness in Sierra Club of Canada v. Canada (Minister of Finance), 2002 SCC 41, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 522 and Sherman Estate v. Donovan, 2021 SCC 25, the Federal Court issued a restricted confidentiality order largely to protect the strong privacy interests of the complainant before the Privacy Commissioner. It also discontinued an earlier publication ban.\n[7] In this Court, the appellants successfully obtained a stay of the Federal Court\u2019s order pending this appeal. As will be discussed, portions of this file and the hearing of this appeal have been subject to confidentiality and publication orders and other orders and directions, largely to ensure that the appellants\u2019 appeal, aimed at preventing disclosure, did not become moot through disclosure.\n[8] We will dismiss this appeal.\n[9] The Federal Court did not err in law in making the order it did. It properly identified and applied the applicable law.\n[10] The appellants have failed to show that the Federal Court\u2019s application of the law to the evidence was tainted by a reviewable error within the meaning of Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. Under Housen, the Federal Court\u2019s assessment of the weight of evidence is reviewable only for palpable and overriding error. The appellants have demonstrated no such error. This Court does not reweigh the evidence before the Federal Court, nor does it substitute its view of the facts for that of the Federal Court.\n[11] We do not accept the appellant\u2019s submission that the Federal Court\u2019s evidentiary findings were affected by a misunderstanding and misapplication of Newbould v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FCA 106, [2018] 1 F.C.R. 590 and Glooscap Heritage Society v. Canada (National Revenue), 2012 FCA 255.\n[12] We add that even if the standard of review on evidentiary findings were more favourable to the appellants and we could reweigh and reassess the evidence, in our view, substantially for the reasons given by the Federal Court, the evidence was indeed deficient, insufficient, and inadequate to establish irreparable harm. From evidence of this quality, it was not possible for the Federal Court nor would it be possible for us to infer that the harm would be irreparable. To attempt to do so would put the courts in the realm of speculation, assumption or guesswork about the quality of the harm the appellants would suffer and, thus, whether it is irreparable. Whether the Commissioner could redact portions of any report to eliminate irreparable harm pending legal challenge could affect the assessment of irreparable harm. As well, further affecting that assessment is the fact that some of the information the appellants seek to keep confidential is already public in media reports. The overall result is evidentiary uncertainty.\n[13] We are also not persuaded that if this appeal is dismissed the judicial review pending in the Federal Court would become moot.\n[14] Both the appellants and the respondent filed motions to admit fresh evidence in the appeal. The appellants\u2019 motion was said to be dependent on the respondent\u2019s motion. As we are dismissing this appeal, both motions are now moot.\n[15] This is sufficient to determine this appeal and the motions. However, a few words need to be said about the challenges posed by the open court principle in appeals such as this. Our words are not specifically directed to the counsel in this case but rather to courts and the legal profession at large.\n[16] The open court principle is of constitutional force, essential in a democratic state, and has been described as the \u201cvery soul of justice\u201d: Sierra Club at paras. 36, 52 and 86; Sherman Estate at para. 1; Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 480 at para. 22. The guidance in these cases is firm, binding and clear, a prescription for all participants in the justice system to follow.\n[17] This appeal presented an unusual challenge. Before us was a difficult chicken-and-egg situation: under appeal was an order denying parties\u2019 request for confidentiality based on evidence that itself was said to be confidential. But undue openness and disclosure in the appeal would render moot the appellants\u2019 appeal seeking confidentiality. Despite this, in the end, after eight directions and orders issued by this Court in the last month, much openness was achieved, making it possible for public observers to appreciate the nature of what was taking place.\n[18] As for the hearing in this case, we emphasized the need to keep it as open as possible and the closed session as short as possible. To this end, only a five-minute portion was held in closed session.\n[19] In cases like this, all in the justice system must keep the open court principle front of mind. For example, counsel must remember that they are officers of the court, ethically bound to further the administration of justice and the public\u2019s confidence in it. Counsel must work with the Court to ensure that the Court\u2019s proceedings are as open as possible.\n[20] In particular, all must follow strictly the guidelines\u2014open to interpretation and occasional difficulties of application\u2014as they are set out in Sierra Club and Sherman Estate. Among other things, in exceptional cases\u2014and truly exceptional they must be\u2014where the need for confidentiality has an important public dimension as explained in these cases, confidentiality must nevertheless be minimized. In this regard, where possible\u2014and it almost always is\u2014public versions of confidential material must be filed alongside confidential material and the redactions in the confidential material must be minimized in accordance with a strict reading of the governing confidentiality order.\n[21] This Court regularly reviews its practices in cases involving confidential evidence\u2014especially in particularly challenging cases such as this\u2014to ensure that our proceedings are as open as possible, in accordance with Sierra Club, Sherman Estate and the fundamental constitutional imperatives that underlie them.\n[22] For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss the motions and the appeal, all with costs to the respondent, fixed by agreement at $10,000 all inclusive.\n\u201cDavid Stratas\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-297-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\n9219-1568 QUEBEC INC.

The appellant alleged various intentional torts and breaches of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11 (the Charter) by his employer, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and certain employees. The Federal Court (Ebadi v. Canada, 2022 FC 834 per Brown J.) struck the action, holding that it was barred by the combined operation of sections 236 and 208 of the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 2 (FPSLRA). Together, these provisions bar any civil recourse for \u201cany dispute relating to\u2026 terms or conditions of employment\u201d which can be addressed through a grievance procedure.\n[2] I would dismiss the appeal. The Federal Court correctly understood and applied paragraph 208(1)(b) and section 236 of the FPSLRA, and did not err in refusing to exercise its residual discretion to allow the claim to proceed.\nThe Federal Court decision\n[3] The appellant, a Canadian citizen and practicing Muslim, has been employed with CSIS since 2000 in the Prairie Regional office in Edmonton. He has been on sick leave since January of 2018 because of an alleged pattern of discrimination, humiliation, harassment and psychological abuse in the workplace. He commenced an action in the Federal Court against CSIS alleging the intentional torts of mental suffering, assault and battery, as well as breaches of his Charter rights under sections 2, 7, and 15. The appellant sought damages in tort and under subsection 24(1) of the Charter.\n[4] Applying the \u201cplain and obvious\u201d test from R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45 (Federal Court decision at paras. 26-29), the Federal Court granted the respondents\u2019 motion to strike the claim. After examining the allegations in the claim in light of the jurisprudence, the Federal Court held that section 236 of the FPSLRA barred all of the appellant\u2019s claims.\n[5] The Federal Court judge acknowledged that the bar in section 236 of the FPSLRA only applies to disputes that may be grieved under section 208 of the FPSLRA. However, the judge found that the appellant\u2019s allegations relating to threats, harassment, and discrimination could be grieved under paragraph 208(1)(b) of the FPSLRA, noting that prior case law had applied this provision to a wide range of workplace-related disputes, including allegations of discrimination and harassment (Federal Court decision at paras. 38-41). Also, in the Federal Court\u2019s view, the fact that the appellant requested Charter remedies (Federal Court decision at paras. 43-44) did not place the claims outside the scope of section 208. These conclusions were described as the \u201ccomplete answer to his submissions\u201d (Federal Court decision at para. 48).\n[6] In reaching his decision the judge noted that the harassment allegations fell within the scope of the CSIS Safe, Healthy and Respectful Workplace Policy, as well as the corresponding CSIS policy dealing with the resolution of harassment complaints (collectively, the Harassment Policy). While article 5.19 of the Harassment Policy precluded a grievance in respect of a harassment investigators\u2019 report, the judge noted that this only precluded grievances in respect of the conclusions of an investigator in a harassment claim; a complainant would still be able to grieve the manner in which the investigation was conducted, management\u2019s decision to accept or reject the investigator\u2019s report and management\u2019s decision with respect to a remedy (Federal Court decision at para. 58).\n[7] Finally, the Federal Court held that the circumstances of the case did not warrant the exercise of any residual discretion that the Court might retain in light of the statutory scheme. In this regard, the Court noted that the appellant had never filed a complaint under the Harassment Policy in the course of his 20-year career at CSIS nor had he engaged the CSIS grievance procedure (Federal Court decision at para. 47). The Federal Court also did not find the appellant\u2019s evidence in support of the assertion that the harassment and grievance procedures at CSIS were \u201cfutile\u201d or \u201cbroken\u201d to be convincing (Federal Court decision at para. 61).\nThe appellant\u2019s case\n[8] The core of the appellant\u2019s appeal is that the Federal Court erred in concluding that the Charter breaches and intentional torts alleged by the appellant were grievable under paragraph 208(1)(b) of the FPSLRA, as this brings too broad an interpretation to the language of \u201cterms and conditions of employment\u201d. He argues that employees do not forgo civil remedies they might have against their employer in respect of intentional torts. In this regard, the appellant emphasizes that he could not have grieved his claims of harassment, given the existence of article 5.19 of CSIS\u2019s Harassment Policy, which channels harassment complaints away from the grievance procedure.\n[9] His second ground of appeal is that the Federal Court erred in declining to exercise its residual discretion to hear the appellant\u2019s action. The appellant emphasizes that the judge overlooked key facts that were relevant to the exercise of residual discretion. Those included that the appellant does not belong to a union, that the remedies sought are not available through existing CSIS procedures, that CSIS\u2019s harassment procedures provide limited procedural rights and avenues of review and that there was systemic discrimination, harassment, and a fear of reprisal for complaints within CSIS.\n[10] The appellant also raises a new argument before this Court. He challenges the constitutional validity of section 236 of the FPSLRA, arguing that section 236 of the FPSLRA is unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibits a court from hearing claims under the Charter.\n[11] I will deal briefly with this argument now.\n[12] The appellant did not raise this issue at first instance, and did not serve a notice of constitutional question in accordance with section 57 of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-7 until one month after the respondents raised the issue in their submissions.\n[13] The decision whether to hear a constitutional challenge for the first time on appeal is discretionary, albeit one governed by specific considerations including the state of the record, fairness to all parties, the importance of having the issue resolved, the issue\u2019s suitability for decision, and more broadly, the fair and efficient administration of justice. The burden is on the challenging party to show that hearing the issue would be appropriate and non-prejudicial (Guindon v. Canada, 2015 SCC 41, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 3 at para. 23).\n[14] The test is strict, and, as a general premise, courts are hesitant to address the constitutional validity of a provision without a sufficient factual context (Smith v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 122, 2023 A.C.W.S. 2306 at para. 52; Filion v. Canada., 2017 FCA 67, 77 A.C.W.S. (3d) 211 at para. 14). A constitutional challenge raised for the first time on appeal may rest on an inadequate and potentially prejudicial evidentiary foundation and the appellate court is deprived of a trial judge\u2019s reasoning and analysis (Luk\u00e1cs v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 FCA 36, 2023 A.C.W.S. 639 at paras. 73-74).\n[15] I would not exercise my discretion to hear the constitutional argument raised by the appellant. The arguments were not developed before us in either memorandum and the Court does not have the benefit of the Federal Court\u2019s consideration of the issues. It would be premature for us to offer an opinion on the constitutionality of an important statutory provision in these circumstances.\n[16] I return to the substance of this appeal and note that the appellate standards from Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, i.e. correctness for questions of law, and palpable and overriding error for questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law, apply. There are extricable questions of law raised by this appeal: whether the appellant\u2019s claims of Charter breaches and intentional torts could have been grieved under paragraph 208(1)(b) of the FPSLRA, and whether, even if the appellant\u2019s claims could have been so grieved, the Federal Court has a residual discretion to hear the matter in light of the grievance scheme. Assuming that it did have this discretion, the question of whether the judge erred in the exercise of that discretion is assessed against a standard of palpable and overriding error.\nThe statutory scheme\n[17] I begin with the central issue on this appeal\u2014whether the judge erred in finding that the appellant could have grieved his allegations of intentional torts and Charter breaches under paragraph 208(1)(b) of the FPSLRA. Sections 208 and 236 are set forth in their entirety in the appendix at the end of these reasons. I have however extracted the two key provisions in issue in this appeal:\n208(1) Subject to subsections (2) to (7), an employee is entitled to present an individual grievance if he or she feels aggrieved\n(a) by the interpretation or application, in respect of the employee, of\n(i) a provision of a statute or regulation, or of a direction or other instrument made or issued by the employer, that deals with terms and conditions of employment, or\n(ii) a provision of a collective agreement or an arbitral award; or\n(b) as a result of any occurrence or matter affecting his or her terms and conditions of employment.\n208 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (2) \u00e0 (7), le fonctionnaire a le droit de pr\u00e9senter un grief individuel lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019estime l\u00e9s\u00e9 :\na) par l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ou l\u2019application \u00e0 son \u00e9gard :\n(i) soit de toute disposition d\u2019une loi ou d\u2019un r\u00e8glement, ou de toute directive ou de tout autre document de l\u2019employeur concernant les conditions d\u2019emploi,\n(ii) soit de toute disposition d\u2019une convention collective ou d\u2019une d\u00e9cision arbitrale;\nb) par suite de tout fait portant atteinte \u00e0 ses conditions d\u2019emploi.\n236(1) The right of an employee to seek redress by way of grievance for any dispute relating to his or her terms or conditions of employment is in lieu of any right of action that the employee may have in relation to any act or omission giving rise to the dispute.\n(2) Subsection (1) applies whether or not the employee avails himself or herself of the right to present a grievance in any particular case and whether or not the grievance could be referred to adjudication.\n236 (1) Le droit de recours du fonctionnaire par voie de grief relativement \u00e0 tout diff\u00e9rend li\u00e9 \u00e0 ses conditions d\u2019emploi remplace ses droits d\u2019action en justice relativement aux faits \u2014 actions ou omissions \u2014 \u00e0 l\u2019origine du diff\u00e9rend.\n(2) Le paragraphe (1) s\u2019applique que le fonctionnaire se pr\u00e9vale ou non de son droit de pr\u00e9senter un grief et qu\u2019il soit possible ou non de soumettre le grief \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage.\n[18] It is instructive to begin with the decisions of the Supreme Court in Weber v. Ontario Hydro, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 929, 1995 CanLII 108 [Weber] and Vaughan v. Canada, 2005 SCC 11, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 146 [Vaughan]. These decisions provide critical guidance in considering the issues raised by this appeal.\n[19] In Weber the employer sent a private investigator to the employee\u2019s home to investigate the employee\u2019s entitlement to the sick leave benefits he had been claiming. The investigator entered the employee\u2019s home under false pretenses. The employee filed grievances against his employer and concurrently brought an action in the provincial court based on various torts and breaches of the Charter. The Supreme Court held that the employee\u2019s action was barred by subsection 45(1) of Ontario\u2019s Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.2, which provided that all collective agreements \u201cshall provide for the final and binding settlement by arbitration\u2026 of all differences between the parties arising from the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the agreement\u201d.\n[20] The Court held that the arbitrator was to have exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes arising out of the collective agreement. The Court rejected that there could be overlapping jurisdiction between courts and labour arbitrators where issues extended to the common law, the Charter, or matters outside of the traditional subject matter of labour law. This approach would undercut not only the clear statutory language at issue, but the purpose of the exclusive arbitration regime that is \u201cat the heart of all Canadian labour statutes\u201d, which provides for quick, economic resolution of claims (Weber at paras. 39-50).\n[21] In determining whether a dispute arises out of a collective agreement, the Court held that decision-makers must look to the \u201cessential character\u201d of the dispute. This involves assessing the facts of the dispute. The place at which the dispute arose and the parties to the dispute may be relevant, but are not determinative (Weber at paras. 43 and 51-52).\n[22] Importantly, for the purposes of the issues before us, the Supreme Court was clear that it is the facts that govern, and not the legal characterization that counsel give to those facts. This has implications for the appellant\u2019s argument that intentional torts can never have a connection to the workplace, as it can never be within the terms and conditions of employment that an employee foregoes a right to sue for compensation for an intentional tort in the workplace. Weber teaches that the inquiry must remain focused on the facts that gave rise to the dispute.\n[23] The Supreme Court also confirmed the ability of labour adjudicators to consider torts and Charter breaches, as well as to award Charter remedies (paras. 55-56 and 66). While arbitrators may not have the same expertise as courts, they are still subject to judicial review. If there is a remedy required that an arbitrator cannot grant, courts of inherent jurisdiction can take jurisdiction\u2014though there must be a \u201creal deprivation of the ultimate remedy\u201d sought (Weber at para. 57).\n[24] The dispute in Weber was, in fact, related to the employee\u2019s collective agreement. The Court acknowledged that \u201c[i]solated from the collective agreement, the conduct complained of in this case might well be argued to fall outside the normal scope of employer-employee relations\u201d (Weber at para. 71). However, the collective agreement provided that the grievance procedure applied to \u201c[a]ny allegation that an employee has been subjected to unfair treatment or any dispute arising out of the content of this Agreement\u201d (Weber at para. 72).\n[25] A decade after Weber came Vaughan. In Vaughan, the employee, a federal public servant, was denied early retirement benefits. The denial was grievable, but not arbitrable. The employee did not grieve the denial of benefits, but instead brought an action in the Federal Court based in negligence, alleging that his employer ought to have known that he was eligible for the benefits. The employee argued that Weber was distinguishable since there was no independent third-party adjudication available to him. (I add, parenthetically, that the appellant in this appeal also has no recourse to adjudication.)\n[26] The Supreme Court held that the employee\u2019s action was barred by what are now sections 208 and 209 of the FPSLRA. While these provisions did not explicitly oust the court\u2019s jurisdiction, the comprehensive nature of the scheme and the rationale behind it signalled that courts should defer to grievance processes. The lack of third-party adjudication did not, in and of itself, allow a court to exercise its residual discretion to hear a claim. Courts exercise their residual discretion, for example, in circumstances where a whistle-blowing claim is brought or where the integrity of the grievance process or the effectiveness of available remedies is called into question. However, courts should generally decline to get involved in such disputes, except via judicial review (Vaughan at paras. 13, 16-17, 22, and 39).\n[27] The Court, echoing Weber, noted that permitting parallel access to the courts would jeopardize the comprehensive scheme for labour disputes meant to provide specialized, expedient resolutions. The Court also cautioned litigants against \u201cdressing [] up\u201d grievable disputes as negligence actions, guidance which is particularly apposite to this appeal (Vaughan at paras. 37, 40, and 42).\n[28] Following Vaughan, Parliament added section 236 to the FPSLRA, which provides that the court\u2019s jurisdiction is ousted by grievance processes even where there is no third-party adjudication. The Ontario Court of Appeal in Bron v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 ONCA 71, [2010] O.J. No. 340 [Bron] noted that this effectively patched the \u201cwhistle-blower exception\u201d coming out of Vaughan, leaving courts with residual discretion to hear grievable claims only where the grievance process cannot provide an appropriate remedy (Bron at paras. 27-30).\n[29] Since Weber and Vaughan, conflicts related to the \u201cterms and conditions of employment\u201d referred to in paragraph 208(1)(b) of the FPSLRA have been considered to encompass allegations of defamation, discrimination, harassment, malice and bad faith, Charter breaches, and intentional torts, including intentional infliction of mental suffering (see, for example: Nosistel v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FC 618, [2018] CarswellNat 10225 (WL Can) at para. 66; Price v. Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 649, 268 A.C.W.S. (3d) 866 at paras. 26-31; Green v. Canada (Border Services Agency), 2018 FC 414, 291 A.C.W.S. (3d) 402 at para. 16; Bron at paras. 14-15; Thompson v. Kolotinsky, 2023 ONSC 1588 (Div. Ct.), 2023 A.C.W.S. 2518 at paras. 37-39).\n[30] In Hudson v. Canada, 2022 FC 694, 2022 C.L.L.C. 220-053 [Hudson] the Federal Court held that allegations of sexual assault in the workplace were grievable. The Court noted that given the breadth of section 208, the plaintiffs could not escape the operation of section 236 of the FPSLRA simply by alleging that their claims were not \u201cordinary workplace disputes\u201d. The Federal Court pointed to Jane Doe v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 183, 428 D.L.R. (4th) 374, in which this Court found that an adjudicating board had unreasonably denied compensation for pain and suffering to an employee who had been subject to a sexual assault by her co-worker\u2014demonstrating that sexual assault claims have been, at least implicitly, recognized as grievable (Hudson at paras. 102-103).\n[31] Two cases are helpful in fleshing out the contours of the required nexus to the workplace\/employment.\n[32] In Martell v. AG of Canada & Ors., 2016 PECA 8, 376 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 91 [Martell], the claimant brought an action against her employer alleging harassment and a hostile work environment, as well as harassment by individual defendants that occurred after her resignation. The Court held that the claims covering occurrences during her employment were grievable, as they arose in the workplace, during the course of her employment and by perpetrators in the performance of their duties (Martell at paras. 11-13). The claims that arose post-resignation, though, were not grievable, as \u201c[c]laims of abuse, threats, and harassment which occurred long after the employment relationship ended cannot be considered matters in which the essential character of the dispute is rooted in the appellant\u2019s term of employment\u201d (Martell at para. 37).\n[33] Similarly, in Joseph v. Canada School of Public Service et al., 2022 ONSC 6734, 2022 CarswellOnt 17461 [Joseph], the claimant was terminated following a security investigation at her workplace, during which her employer involved the police. The claimant alleged the torts of breach of privacy, negligence, and defamation. The Court held that the portions of the claim dealing with the employer\u2019s involving of the police and the consequent alleged breaches of privacy were not grievable, since their essential character did not relate to the employee\u2019s collective agreement, but rather to \u201cpotential resort to the criminal process\u201d (Joseph at para. 29). The balance of the claims (negligence and defamation, in association with the suspensions and investigation) were grievable, as they related to the managerial duties of discipline (Joseph at para. 31).\n[34] The appellant contends that the words \u201caffecting\u2026 terms and conditions of employment\u201d must be given a more restrictive meaning than that accorded to them by the Federal Court, or indeed, by much of the jurisprudence. I do not agree.\n[35] Each word in a statute must be given meaning; it is presumed that the legislature does not speak in vain. Courts should therefore \u201cavoid, as much as possible, adopting interpretations that would render any portion of a statute meaningless\u201d (Ruth Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes, 7th ed. (Toronto, ON: LexisNexis Canada, 2022) at \u00a78.03). Every word has a specific role to play in advancing the legislative purpose, and in this case the word \u201caffecting\u201d is integral to understanding the meaning of the section. Parliament chose a word with a broad sweep; it did not say \u201cin the terms and conditions of employment\u201d. As observed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Bron at paragraph 15, \u201c[a]lmost all employment-related disputes can be grieved under s[ection] 208\u201d.\n[36] This interpretation aligns with the object of the FPSLRA, which was to establish a comprehensive and exclusive scheme for the resolution of labour disputes (Vaughan at para. 39). To allow large categories of claims\u2014such as any claim involving an intentional tort or Charter breach\u2014to escape the operation of the FPSLRA would undermine Parliament\u2019s intent. Many if not all workplace grievances could, through artful pleading, be cast as intentional torts: for example, a manager speaking harshly to an employee could be said to be intentionally inflicting mental harm, or the failure to be promoted an act of discrimination. To exempt these claims from the grievance process could effectively gut the scheme, reducing it to the most mechanical and administrative elements of employment relationships, such as hours of work, overtime, classification and pay.\n[37] The application of section 208 cannot be driven by the label that a party assigns to the behaviour or conduct. This would divert from the true inquiry, which is the degree of connectedness between the complaint and the workplace. Here, the essential character of the appellant\u2019s allegations is that CSIS failed to provide the appellant that which it committed to provide by its policies\u2014a safe and harassment-free workplace. A safe and harassment-free workplace, manifested by managerial practices and co-worker behaviour, must at the very least be impliedly part of any employee\u2019s terms and conditions.\nWhether CSIS policy bars grievance\n[38] The appellant argues that, in any event, he could not grieve the allegations in the statement of claim in light of article 5.19 of the Harassment Policy and thus the grievance process could not provide him with an effective remedy:\n5.19: The investigator\u2019s conclusion(s) cannot be subject to a grievance.\n[39] The Federal Court held that while the appellant could not have grieved the conclusions of an investigator, other key elements of a harassment claim could be grieved, including the manner in which an investigation was conducted, management\u2019s decision to accept or reject the investigator\u2019s report and any decision with respect to remedy or discipline (Federal Court decision at para. 58).\n[40] I agree with the Federal Court that the harassment investigation process, and what management did with the report, including any remedy, could have been grieved; but I would go further. While inelegantly framed, article 5.19 does not constitute a dead-end for the employee; rather it simply means that the report itself does not trigger a new, independent grievance, separate and apart from the conduct that sparked the filing of the harassment complaint. Article 5.19 confirms that the investigation report itself is a preliminary step, with no direct consequence unless and until accepted by management. The effect of article 5.19 is to ensure that the harassment inquiry is not diverted from the true focus\u2014the conduct in question. Management\u2019s decision to accept or reject the report is therefore grievable. It is then that the substantive right to grieve arises; acceptance of the report makes it a management decision.\n[41] This result accords with Kane J.\u2019s holding in Thomas v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 FC 292, 430 F.T.R. 1 [Thomas]. There, the Court held that there was no procedural unfairness in a harassment complainant not being provided with a copy of the investigator\u2019s final report for comment prior to its submission to the responsible manager. The Court pointed out that such an approach would be inefficient and contrary to the set-up of the scheme: the investigation itself is delegated, with the manager making the ultimate decision based on the final report of the investigator (Thomas at para. 89). While Thomas dealt with a different workplace and therefore a different investigatory scheme, the case stands for the proposition that the ultimate conclusion of a manager, though based on an investigation, is purposefully separate from the conclusion of the investigator. This reasoning, when applied to the CSIS Harassment Policy, leaves the conduct complained of grievable.\n[42] In addition, subsection 208(5) of the FPSLRA does not assist the appellant. Subsection 208(5) provides that \u201c[a]n employee who, in respect of any matter, avails himself or herself of a complaint procedure established by a policy of the employer may not present an individual grievance in respect of that matter if the policy expressly provides that an employee who avails himself or herself of the complaint procedure is precluded from presenting an individual grievance under this Act\u201d.\n[43] For the provision to apply, two conditions must be met: the employee must avail himself or herself of a complaint procedure established by a policy of the employer, and that policy must expressly provide that the employee is precluded from grieving the matter.\n[44] As explained below, the appellant did not avail himself of the complaint procedure under the Harassment Policy. In any event, as I have concluded, article 5.19 of the Harassment Policy does not preclude an employee from presenting an individual grievance under the FPSLRA. Subsection 208(5) does not affect the appellant\u2019s right to grieve.\n[45] I would therefore dismiss this argument.\nWhether the Court should have exercised its residual discretion\n[46] The Federal Court did not err in declining to exercise its residual discretion to hear the appellant\u2019s action.\n[47] In Canada v. Greenwood, 2021 FCA 186, [2021] 4 F.C.R. 635, this Court confirmed the existence of a residual discretion but confined its exercise to circumstances where \u201cthe internal mechanisms are incapable of providing effective redress\u201d (at para. 130). Similarly, the New Brunswick Court of Appeal has confined the discretion to circumstances where the grievance process itself is entirely \u201ccorrupt\u201d (Attorney General of Canada, on behalf of Correctional Service of Canada v. Robichaud and MacKinnon, 2013 NBCA 3, 398 N.B.R. (2d) 259 at para. 10). Therefore, the Court\u2019s residual discretion arises where the available mechanisms cannot provide effective redress, either because the legislative scheme does not cover the circumstances, or because the existing processes are demonstrably ineffective (see, for example, Weber at para. 67; Bron at para. 29).\n[48] The Federal Court determined, and I agree, that the interpretation or application of CSIS policies, including the Harassment Policy, could be grieved under subparagraph 208(1)(a)(i) (Federal Court decision at paras. 48-49). I agree that this would encompass various claims of the appellant, with the broader paragraph 208(1)(b) capturing the balance of his claims. There is no legislative gap.\n[49] The Federal Court also found that the evidence put forward by the appellant did not support the conclusion that the CSIS grievance process was \u201cbroken\u201d or \u201cfutile\u201d or \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d (Federal Court decision at para. 61). The Federal Court considered both a statement of the Director of CSIS as to the existence of systemic racism and the assertion in an expert report of a culture of fear of reprisal. The Federal Court was not persuaded by this evidence and gave thoughtful reasons in support of its conclusion. I see no reviewable error in its assessment of this evidence.\n[50] I turn to the argument that the judge erred in finding that a harassment complaint had not been filed, and that this coloured his approach to the exercise of his discretion.\n[51] The appellant alleges that he filed a harassment complaint pursuant to the Harassment Policy, but that it was ignored. To this end, he points to two emails he sent to management in 2017 as constituting his filing of a complaint. He says that they are sufficient to put management on notice of his concerns and that the Federal Court judge erred in concluding that the Harassment Policy had not been invoked.\n[52] In the first email the appellant alleged that he was disturbed during prayer by a co-worker, causing stress and anxiety. The appellant stated that he \u201cneed[s]\u2026 help\u201d as he did not know what would be \u201cthe next plot to harm [him]\u201d (Appeal Book at p. 109). This email resulted in the appellant\u2019s manager meeting with one of the appellant\u2019s alleged harassers to hear her side of the story and to set certain behavioural boundaries with her. The appellant emailed his manager approximately one week later, alleging that his co-workers continued to bother him by \u201cwalking back and forth in front of [his] office and trying to take a peek into [his] office\u201d (Appeal Book at p. 121). The appellant\u2019s manager acknowledged his email and stated that further action would be taken. It does not appear that there was any further follow-up by either party.\n[53] The appellant also relies on an email sent to management in 2013 in which he alleges an unreasonable workload and mistreatment at work, including subjection to \u201chumiliation, abuse and harassment\u201d (Appeal Book at p. 152). This email resulted in some action by management, including supervision of the appellant, referral to health supports, other employee support programs and to CSIS\u2019s Internal Conflict Management Service.\n[54] I am not convinced that the judge made a palpable and overriding error in his conclusion that a harassment complaint had not been filed. The judge considered this evidence and concluded that a complaint had not been filed. His decision has an evidentiary foundation. The judge noted that the appellant never engaged the formal Harassment Policy procedures, never asked that his emails be treated as a harassment complaint and never followed up on them, as one would reasonably expect. The appellant also reluctantly conceded under cross-examination that while he was aware of CSIS\u2019s Harassment Policy as early as 2008 or 2009, he never filed a formal complaint (Appeal Book at pp. 814-816 and 820).\n[55] The filing of a harassment complaint has consequences for the organization and certainly for the person alleged to have breached departmental standards of conduct. Complaints, whether memorialized or not, about disputes or misbehaviour are insufficient to inferentially trigger the policy. There must be sufficient precision in the complaint, identifying when, whom and what conduct or behaviour, and, importantly, a clear stated intention on the part of the employee to commence a harassment complaint in order for management to begin an investigation.\n[56] Finally, the appellant contends that the lack of civil damages and Charter remedies available warrants a favourable exercise of discretion to allow his action to proceed to trial.\n[57] I do not agree.\n[58] At no time during his twenty-year career did the appellant file a complaint under the Harassment Policy or the grievance procedure. As Brown J. rightly concluded, \u201c[h]e cannot now litigate in this Court the adequacy of procedures he himself chose never to follow\u201d (Federal Court decision at para. 47). This is consistent with what Binnie J. noted in Vaughan: courts should generally decline to exercise their jurisdiction where the claimant\u2019s legal position would be improved by a failure to engage with available grievance procedures. To allow the appellant to come to the courts without having used the workplace harassment procedures available would undermine efficient labour relations, as it would put the courts in competition with existing labour schemes, clogging up a system designed to streamline dispute resolution (Vaughan at para. 37). I note again that a lack of third-party adjudication does not itself make a scheme less worthy of deference, and does not itself allow a court to exercise its residual discretion (Vaughan at para. 38).\n[59] Further, the absence of remedies argument was based on the assumption that article 5.19 of the Harassment Policy precluded access to grievance procedures. This assumption is, for the reasons I have explained, incorrect. The conduct in issue can be grieved and the final level grievance decision is subject to judicial review.\n[60] Nor did this Court hear argument on the scope of remedies available to the appellant should his grievance be successful. We did not hear, for example, of any possibility of compensation under the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. G-5 (GECA). The Federal Court has cited the GECA as a possible source of compensation in lieu of an action for workplace injuries\u2014including injuries to mental health (Hudson at para. 61). Additionally, remedial schemes like the GECA are to be interpreted so as to achieve coherence with related legislation, which would include the FPSLRA (R. v. Ulybel Enterprises Ltd., 2001 SCC 56, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 867 at paras. 50-52; see also L\u00e9vis (City) v. Fraternit\u00e9 des policiers de L\u00e9vis Inc., 2007 SCC 14, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 591 at para. 47). I, of course, make no decision whether the GECA would actually allow the appellant to claim compensation under the circumstances.\n[61] Accordingly, I would sustain the judge\u2019s decision not to exercise his discretion to allow the action to proceed.\n[62] I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\u201cDonald J. Rennie\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nMonica Biringer J.A.\u201d\nWEBB J.A. (Dissenting Reasons)\n[63] I have read my colleagues\u2019 reasons. I would, however, reach a different conclusion with respect to whether the appellant\u2019s statement of claim should be struck in its entirety.\n[64] The appellant filed a statement of claim in the Federal Court. The alleged incidents are summarized in paragraph 11 of the reasons of the Federal Court Judge. In particular, the appellant alleges that:\nJ. He was subjected to insults and assaults from his co-workers while he was praying in his office between 2015 and 2018.\n[65] In paragraph 27 of his statement of claim, the appellant expanded upon the alleged incidents that occurred while he was praying:\n27. Worse still, Jane, Joseph, and others, would enter Sameer\u2019s office by quickly swinging open the door, knowing he was at prayer and located just behind the door, and smash the door into Sameer\u2019s body or head. They would then feign surprise that Sameer was at prayer, but would laugh outside the door afterwards. Jane and Joseph were the individual defendants who took the most pleasure in this \u201cpastime\u201d and did this to Sameer on several occasions between 2015 and 2017, sometimes as often as weekly. Jane also would invite other employees to the attraction for mockery and amusement.\n[66] A further incident is described in paragraph 31 of his statement of claim:\n31. In late January 2018, Sameer returned from a lunch break to discover that someone had obviously spit on his office door while he was away.\n[67] These incidents can generally be characterized as harassment complaints. The alleged causes of action are intentional infliction of mental suffering; assault and battery; and breaches of the appellant\u2019s rights under sections 2, 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982 being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c 11 (Charter).\n[68] The appellant also describes, in his statement of claim, certain interactions with management when he attempted to raise his concerns about harassment and discrimination.\n[69] The motion before the Federal Court was a motion to strike the appellant\u2019s statement of claim. The test for striking a pleading is set out in R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42:\n[17] \u2026 A claim will only be struck if it is plain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action: Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse, 2003 SCC 69, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263, at para. 15; Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959, at p. 980. Another way of putting the test is that the claim has no reasonable prospect of success. Where a reasonable prospect of success exists, the matter should be allowed to proceed to trial: see, generally, Syl Apps Secure Treatment Centre v. B.D., 2007 SCC 38, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 83; Odhavji Estate; Hunt; Attorney General of Canada v. Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 735.\n[70] The key provision in this appeal is subsection 236(1) of the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22 (FPSLRA), which bars an employee from bringing an action with respect to a particular dispute when that employee has a grievance right in relation to the same dispute. In my view, it is important to focus on the specific wording of this provision:\n236 (1) The right of an employee to seek redress by way of grievance for any dispute relating to his or her terms or conditions of employment is in lieu of any right of action that the employee may have in relation to any act or omission giving rise to the dispute.\n236 (1) Le droit de recours du fonctionnaire par voie de grief relativement \u00e0 tout diff\u00e9rend li\u00e9 \u00e0 ses conditions d\u2019emploi remplace ses droits d\u2019action en justice relativement aux faits \u2014 actions ou omissions \u2014 \u00e0 l\u2019origine du diff\u00e9rend.\n[71] This subsection bars \u201cany right of action that the employee may have in relation to any act or omission giving rise to the dispute\u201d. The basis for this bar is that this right of action is replaced by \u201c[t]he right of an employee to seek redress by way of grievance for any dispute relating to his or her terms or conditions of employment\u201d.\n[72] The acts that give rise to the dispute in this case are the acts of certain employees of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). These acts form the basis of the action commenced by the appellant. The reference to \u201cany right of action that the employee may have in relation to any act or omission giving rise to the dispute\u201d (emphasis added) in subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA limits the statutory bar to causes of action that are related to the same acts or omissions for which an employee may seek redress by way of grievance.\n[73] This link between the statutory bar and the right to grieve the same matter is identified by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Bron v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 ONCA 71. In Bron the Ontario Court of Appeal addressed the bar in subsection 236(1) of the Public Service Labour Relations Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 2 (the PSLRA which is now the FPSLRA):\n[29] Parliament can, subject to constitutional limitations that are not raised here, confer exclusive jurisdiction to determine certain disputes on a forum other than the courts. It will take clear language to achieve that result: Pleau [Pleau (Litigation Guardian of) v. Canada (Attorney General), 1999 NSCA 159, 182 D.L.R. (4th) 373, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 27770 (28 September 2000)] at p. 381 [D.L.R.]. Section 236 is clear and unequivocal. Subject to the exception identified in s. 236(3), which has no application here, s. 236(1) declares that the right granted under the legislation to grieve any work related dispute is \u201cin lieu of any right of action\u201d that the employee may have in respect of the same matter. Section 236(2) expressly declares that the exclusivity of the grievance process identified in s. 236(1) operates whether or not the employee actually presents a grievance and \u201cwhether or not the grievance could be referred to adjudication\u201d. The result of the language used in s. 236(1) and (2) is that a court no longer has any residual discretion to entertain a claim that is otherwise grievable under the legislation on the basis of an employee's inability to access third-party adjudication: see Van Duyvenbode v. Canada (Attorney General), [2007] O.J. No. 2716 (S.C.), at para. 17, aff\u2019d without reference to this point, 2009 ONCA 11; Hagal v. Canada (Attorney General), [2009] F.C.J. No. 417, [2009 FC 329] (T.D.), at para. 26, aff\u2019d without reference to this point 2009 FCA 364.\n[emphasis added]\n[74] The Ontario Court of Appeal noted that the bar to bringing an action in relation to a particular dispute applies when an employee has a grievance right with respect to the same matter.\n[75] In Pearce v. Canada (Staff of the Non-Public Funds, Canadian Forces), 2021 ONCA 65, the Ontario Court of Appeal identified the purpose of the FPSLRA:\n[69]The purpose of the FPSLRA is to ensure that the \u201cGovernment of Canada is committed to the fair, credible and efficient resolution of matters arising in respect of terms and conditions of employment.\u201d\n[76] The purpose of having a fair and credible resolution of workplace disputes would be satisfied if an aggrieved employee has a forum in which a particular dispute may be resolved.\n[77] In Vaughan v. Canada, 2005 SCC 11, at paragraph 22, the Supreme Court of Canada stated:\nThe task of the court is still to determine whether, looking at the legislative scheme as a whole, Parliament intended workplace disputes to be decided by the courts or under the grievance procedure established by the PSSRA [Public Service Staff Relations Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-35, which was replaced by the PSLRA and later the FPSLRA].\n[78] Since the Supreme Court only identified two possibilities \u2015 a court procedure or a grievance procedure \u2015 if a grievance procedure is not available then it would fall to the Courts to resolve the dispute. This leads to the question of whether redress by way of grievance is available to the appellant for the same matter that is the subject of the statement of claim.\n[79] Subsection 208(1) of the FPSLRA provides a general right of grievance:\n208 (1) Subject to subsections (2) to (7), an employee is entitled to present an individual grievance if he or she feels aggrieved\n208 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (2) \u00e0 (7), le fonctionnaire a le droit de pr\u00e9senter un grief individuel lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019estime l\u00e9s\u00e9 :\n(a) by the interpretation or application, in respect of the employee, of\na) par l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ou l\u2019application \u00e0 son \u00e9gard :\n(i) a provision of a statute or regulation, or of a direction or other instrument made or issued by the employer, that deals with terms and conditions of employment, or\n(i) soit de toute disposition d\u2019une loi ou d\u2019un r\u00e8glement, ou de toute directive ou de tout autre document de l\u2019employeur concernant les conditions d\u2019emploi,\n(ii) a provision of a collective agreement or an arbitral award; or\n(ii) soit de toute disposition d\u2019une convention collective ou d\u2019une d\u00e9cision arbitrale;\n(b) as a result of any occurrence or matter affecting his or her terms and conditions of employment.\nb) par suite de tout fait portant atteinte \u00e0 ses conditions d\u2019emploi.\n[80] Subsection 208(5) provides that an employee is precluded from presenting a grievance if the employee \u201cavails himself or herself of a complaint procedure established by a policy of the employer\u201d and the applicable policy precludes presenting a grievance:\n(5) An employee who, in respect of any matter, avails himself or herself of a complaint procedure established by a policy of the employer may not present an individual grievance in respect of that matter if the policy expressly provides that an employee who avails himself or herself of the complaint procedure is precluded from presenting an individual grievance under this Act.\n(5) Le fonctionnaire qui choisit, pour une question donn\u00e9e, de se pr\u00e9valoir de la proc\u00e9dure de plainte institu\u00e9e par une ligne directrice de l\u2019employeur ne peut pr\u00e9senter de grief individuel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette question sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi si la ligne directrice pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment cette impossibilit\u00e9.\n[81] Since this provision is conditional on an employee availing himself or herself of a separate complaint procedure, rather than being conditional on such a separate complaint procedure being available, it could raise the question of whether an employee would have the option to choose whether to follow the complaint procedure or present a grievance.\n[82] In this matter, the appellant did not avail himself of \u201cCSIS Procedures: Resolution of Harassment Complaints\u201d (the Harassment Policy). Neither the Federal Court nor the respondent have suggested that since the appellant did not avail himself of the Harassment Policy he would have been able to present a grievance with respect to his complaint of harassment. If he would have attempted to present a grievance with respect to his complaint of harassment, it would appear that article 1.2.2 e) of the Human Resources Policies and Procedures HUM-502 Grievance Resolution (Grievance Policy) and article 5.2 of the Harassment Policy would have been applied and his complaint would have proceeded under the Harassment Policy:\nGrievance Policy\n1.2.2 This policy is not applicable in cases where alternative recourse, through the following policies and procedures, is available:\n\u2026\ne) Resolution of complaints of harassment - refer to \u201cCSIS Procedures \u2013 Resolution of Harassment Complaints\u201d\nHarassment Policy\n5.2 Should an employee file a grievance in which allegations of harassment are raised, the file is first addressed as a harassment complaint. A grievance and a harassment complaint cannot run concurrently for the same situation. If a complaint on the same issue is or has been dealt with through the grievance process, the formal complaint of harassment will not proceed any further and the file will be closed.\n[83] Under the Harassment Policy, if a complaint is found to be admissible (article 5.10), an investigator is appointed by the Assistant Director, Human Resources (ADH) (article 5.12). The Investigation Process is set out in articles 5.15 to 5.19:\n5.15 The ADH must provide the investigator with the Terms of Reference which outline how to proceed with the investigation.\n5.16 A complaint should be investigated and completed within six months. Should there be a requirement to go beyond the six month period, the complainant and respondent must be advised as to the reasons why an extension is required.\n5.17 When the investigation is complete, the investigator must present a final report to the ADH. This report details the allegations, issues and facts provided by the parties and witnesses during the course of the interviews, as well as an analysis and conclusion on whether the allegations of harassment were founded or unfounded.\n5.18 The ADH must review the final report provided by the investigator and make the decision to accept or not to accept the investigator\u2019s conclusion(s). The ADH decision and the findings must be provided to the complainant and the respondent. Where corrective or disciplinary measures may be required, the respondent will be given ten working days to provide comments before a decision is made on the appropriate disciplinary measure. The employee\u2019s DG [Director General], or where applicable the AD [Assistant Director] or DD [Deputy Director] will receive a copy of the final report and determine the measures in consultation with LR [Labour Relations]. Complainants must be notified of any disciplinary measure to be imposed.\n5.19 The investigator\u2019s conclusion(s) cannot be subject to a grievance.\n[emphasis added]\n[84] Under the Harassment Policy, the investigator\u2019s conclusion cannot be the subject of a grievance (article 5.19). This conclusion is the finding that the allegations of harassment were either founded or unfounded (article 5.17). Therefore, there is no right to grieve an investigator\u2019s finding that an allegation of harassment is unfounded.\n[85] The Federal Court found that the appellant would have some grievance rights:\n[57] In addition, as the AGC notes, it is only the investigator's conclusion(s) under the Harassment Policy that may not be subject to a grievance, by virtue of the article 5.19 of the Harassment Policy quoted above. AGC submits and I find that under the Harassment Policy it is up to CSIS management to accept or reject the investigator's conclusions. It is also up to management to determine what if any remedies to impose.\n[58] Therefore, the AGC asserted and I agree that a CSIS employee such as the Plaintiff may grieve (1) the manner in which the investigation was conducted (as the Court found in Shoan v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 1003 per Justice Zinn), (2) management's decision to accept or reject the investigator's report, and (3) management's decision in relation to remedy. This list is not intended to be exhaustive; it deals only with matters arising in the present litigation. In my respectful view, these findings concerning the scope and range of grievable matters in relation to the Harassment Policy answer the Plaintiff's objections to the Defendants' motion to strike.\n[86] What is missing from this list of matters that may be grieved is the right to grieve whether the alleged conduct of the employees constitutes harassment. The appellant\u2019s dispute is in relation to this conduct and whether this conduct is harassment that could support the causes of action raised in his statement of claim.\n[87] The matters that may be grieved, as identified above by the Federal Court, are limited by the ban on grieving the investigator\u2019s conclusion as set out in article 5.19 of the Harassment Policy. A grievance concerning the manner in which the investigation was conducted would do little to address the dispute related to the conduct of the CSIS employees without being able to challenge the investigator\u2019s conclusion.\n[88] Assume the investigator\u2019s conclusion is that the allegations were unfounded. Assume an employee successfully grieves the manner in which the investigation was conducted. Since the investigator\u2019s conclusion cannot be the subject of a grievance, would the conclusion (that the allegations were unfounded) remain in place? If a grievance related to the manner in which the investigation was conducted could result in the investigator\u2019s conclusion being set aside, this would mean that an employee would be able to do indirectly what that employee could not do directly. It is not plain and obvious that this right to grieve the manner in which the investigation was conducted would be a substantive grievance right.\n[89] Likewise, any grievance arising as a result of management\u2019s acceptance of an investigator\u2019s report that concludes that the allegations are unfounded would presumably not include any right to challenge the investigator\u2019s conclusion.\n[90] Furthermore, the list of matters that could be the subject of a grievance (as identified in paragraph 58 of the reasons of the Federal Court) are all matters that arise as a result of the actions of someone other than the employees whose acts are the subject of the statement of claim. They are not the same matters that are the basis for the statement of claim. The acts that are grievable are the acts of the investigator (the manner in which the investigation was conducted) or management (management\u2019s decision to accept or reject the investigator\u2019s report or management\u2019s decision in relation to a remedy). The acts that give rise to the dispute that resulted in the statement of claim being filed are not the acts of the investigator or management. They are the acts of the appellant\u2019s fellow employees of CSIS.\n[91] There is some support in the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal in Pontbriand v. Administration du r\u00e9gime de soins de sant\u00e9 de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, 2011 QCCA 157 for finding that if a particular procedure excludes a right to grieve, the bar in subsection 236 does not apply. The issue in that case was whether a federal civil servant could commence a Court proceeding against the Federal Public Service Health Care Plan Administration Authority for refusing reimbursement of certain medial expenses that the employee had claimed. The Qu\u00e9bec Court of Appeal found that the dispute did not involve a decision of the employer and, therefore, section 236 of the PSLRA did not apply. The Court also noted, however, that the directive governing the PSHCP excluded the grievance procedure and, therefore, that subsection 208(5) would also have resulted in section 236 not applying:\n[25] As argued by the intervener, the essence of the dispute here is the refusal of the PSHCP Administration to reimburse medical expenses; in short, it is a matter related to the administration of the Public Service Health Care Plan. No employer decision is involved. Moreover, the directive governing the PSHCP excludes the grievance procedure under subsection 208(5) PSHCP. It follows that section 236 PSLRA, which provides that the right of an employee to seek redress by way of grievance is in lieu of any right of action in relation to his or her conditions of employment, does not apply\u2026\n[The Qu\u00e9bec Court of Appeal added emphasis to \u201cconditions of employment\u201d and I added the other emphasis]\n[92] The issue in this appeal is not whether the appellant would be successful in his claim. Rather, the issue is whether \u201cit is plain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action\u201d (R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. referred to in paragraph 7 above). Absent a clear right to grieve whether the alleged conduct of the employees constitutes harassment, in my view, it is not plain and obvious that subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA would bar the appellant\u2019s claims based on the causes of action identified in his statement of claim that arise from the same conduct of the appellant\u2019s fellow employees.\n[93] As a result, I would allow the appeal and I would not strike the entire statement of claim.\n[94] The remedy the appellant seeks is setting aside the Federal Court Judgment and dismissing the Respondents\u2019 motion brought under Rule 221 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106.\n[95] The Federal Court Judge, in paragraph 21 of his reasons, noted that, if he had not struck the entire statement of claim, he would nonetheless have struck paragraphs 33 and 34 thereof. These paragraphs related to an alleged breach of the Access to Information Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1. The appellant has not provided any submissions that address this finding by the Federal Court Judge. Therefore, the finding that paragraphs 33 and 34 of the statement of claim are struck from the statement of claim would remain in place.\n\u201cWyman W.

She first applied for CPP benefits in 2013, and has since attempted to convince the General Division (GD) and the Appeal Division (AD) of the Social Security Tribunal (SST) to overturn the initial decision to deny her disability application made by Service Canada on July 16, 2013.\n[2] In file A-178-20, Ms. Milner challenges the decision of the AD confirming the earlier decision of the GD to the effect that she failed to present new material facts that would justify reopening its 2018 determination that she had not become disabled by the end of her minimum qualifying period (MQP). In file A-16-21, Ms. Milner asks this Court to quash the decision of the AD confirming the decision of the GD on the merits, alleging that both divisions of the SST committed various errors when they decided that she was not entitled to the CPP disability pension.\n[3] After having carefully reviewed and considered both parties\u2019 records, as well as their written and oral submissions, I have come to the conclusion that the AD did not commit an error in applying subsection 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act, S.C. 2005, c. 34 (DESDA), and that both applications should be dismissed. While I sincerely empathize with Ms. Milner\u2019s situation, I cannot find in her favour in the absence of errors that are sufficiently central and significant to render the decisions under review unreasonable. Ms. Milner obviously disagrees with the AD\u2019s assessment of the GD\u2019s findings, and this is perfectly understandable, but it is insufficient for this Court to intervene in its role as a reviewing court.\nI. Facts [4] Ms. Milner is a former insurance agent and mediator. She applied for CPP benefits on January 31, 2013, claiming that she was no longer able to work as of January 2003 due to peripheral vascular disease (PVD), ischemic colitis, lower back arthritis, neuropathic pain and premature ventricular contractions of her heart (Questionnaire for Disability Benefits, Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at p. 818). The Minister denied her application twice \u2013 initially, and on reconsideration (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at pp. 789-795 and 800-805).\n[5] Ms. Milner appealed the Minister\u2019s reconsideration decision to the GD. After conducting a hearing by written questions and answers, the GD dismissed her appeal (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at p. 726). However, the AD allowed the appeal on February 22, 2018 and returned the matter to the GD for a new hearing on the merits, due to a violation of procedural fairness resulting from the failure to conduct an oral hearing (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at p. 515).\n[6] On August 22, 2018, a different member of the GD dismissed Ms. Milner\u2019s appeal after holding a hearing by way of videoconference. The GD determined that Ms. Milner had not established that she suffered from a severe disability on or before the end of her MQP, which was December 31, 2003, based on her contributions to the CPP. The GD also found that many of Ms. Milner\u2019s conditions arose after her MQP, that the medical evidence and her testimony did not establish a disability that was severe as of December 31, 2003, and that her personal characteristics did not adversely affect her employability at the time of her MQP (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at p. 411).\n[7] Although Ms. Milner was in a \u201cfair amount of pain\u201d and exhibited symptoms before the MQP (such as leg, back, shoulder and temporomandibular joint pain, an injured left thumb, and grief), the GD dismissed their significance on the basis that there was insufficient medical evidence, particularly from Ms. Milner\u2019s family physician, which was the only evidence that was contemporaneous with the MQP, to prove their severity. The GD also relied on Ms. Milner\u2019s family physician\u2019s evidence to infer that these symptoms before the end of her MQP were not significant contributors to her main disability.\n[8] Further, the GD dismissed the significance of the symptoms before the end of her MQP on the basis that the evidence was insufficient, subjective and unreliable. For example, the GD found general inconsistencies with dates and found that Ms. Milner stopped her work positions at the YMCA and at an insurance company for reasons other than medical. Finally, the GD found that Ms. Milner\u2019s personal characteristics did not adversely affect her employability during the MQP.\n[9] While appealing the August 2018 decision, Ms. Milner filed an application to rescind or amend that decision in August of 2019. She filed with her application 6 documents which she argued established new material facts: (a) a hospital emergency record describing her injuries from a motor vehicle accident in January 2003; (b) a family doctor report from July 2019; (c) prescription records from October 2008 to November 2016; (d) blood test results from 1988 to 2018; (e) a gastroscopy report from October 2018 suggesting a prior infection; and (f) an undated mental health narrative, in which she explained that she was unable to discover the above-mentioned medical documents in time for the hearing because she was suffering from mental health issues at the time leading up to the hearing.\n[10] On October 26, 2019, the GD refused to rescind or amend its earlier decision, because in its view, Ms. Milner did not establish new material facts within the meaning of paragraph 66(1)(b) of the DESDA, as it read at the relevant time (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at p. 278). The GD found that none of the evidence submitted was new information that was not discoverable at the time of the hearing and material in that it could be reasonably expected to affect the outcome of Ms. Milner\u2019s claim.\n[11] Ms. Milner then sought leave to appeal this new GD decision, which the AD granted on the basis that she raised at least two arguments having a reasonable chance of success on appeal (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at p. 248). Specifically, the AD found that Ms. Milner had an arguable case that the GD erred (a) when it found that information about her childhood H. Pylori infection could not have reasonably affected the outcome, and (b) when it suggested that the cost of holding another hearing on the merits was a factor in its decision not to admit new information.\n[12] At the merits stage, the AD dismissed Ms. Milner\u2019s appeal on June 10, 2020, being of the view that there was no basis to intervene because the GD did not commit a reviewable error within the meaning of subsection 58(1) of DESDA (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at p. 17).\n[13] With respect to Ms. Milner\u2019s submission that she was not well enough to obtain medical records documenting her mental health issues at the time of the July 2018 GD hearing, the AD found that Ms. Milner and her lawyer were aware of additional potentially relevant medical records but chose not to request additional time to obtain them. While Ms. Milner may have been unaware that a postponement was possible, her counsel was presumed to be competent and must have known that such requests are routinely made in adjudicative forums. The AD found that the GD did not act unfairly by relying on Ms. Milner\u2019s counsel\u2019s willingness to proceed with the hearing, even if she now claims that her lawyer made that decision against her informed consent. Nor did the GD err by not taking at face value Ms. Milner\u2019s claim that her mental health issues prevented her from realizing the extent of her problems.\n[14] The AD also found that the GD did not err when it determined that Ms. Milner\u2019s prescription records and blood test results, which predated the GD hearing, were discoverable and could have been adduced before the hearing. It also concluded that the emergency room report from 2003 documenting a visit two weeks after a motor vehicle accident and the family doctor report dated 2019 summarizing her earlier medical history were discoverable and contained information that was already before the GD when it determined that she was not disabled at the relevant time. It was reasonable to expect that Ms. Milner would have at least some idea of the treatment she received and where to obtain information; if she did not have the knowledge or capacity to obtain it herself, she had a lawyer who was presumably hired to help her gather the evidence in support of her case.\n[15] The AD further found that the GD did not err in concluding that the report from Ms. Milner\u2019s gastroenterologist, which stated that she was \u201clikely\u201d infected with H. Pylori from childhood, was not material because it saw no evidence that the bacteria caused any disabling symptoms during the MQP. The AD stressed that new facts are material only if they can be reasonably expected to affect the outcome of a decision. Even if the GD may have failed to recognize the link between H. Pylori and PVD, it could nevertheless focus on the fact that Ms. Milner had not shown that her PVD symptoms prevented her from working before the end of the MQP.\n[16] Finally, the AD found that the GD struck the appropriate balance between efficiency and fairness in deciding to bifurcate the new facts hearing. Far from suggesting that the GD\u2019s decision to defer the arguments on the merits to a second hearing was driven by cost considerations, the AD found that the GD was instead concerned with working out the most logical and efficient way to proceed.\n[17] As for the appeal of the August 2018 GD decision on the merits (File A-16-21), the AD dismissed the appeal on December 16, 2020 (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-16-21), at p. 17). The AD first determined that the GD did not breach procedural fairness when it held a videoconference hearing, in accordance with her stated preference for a videoconference hearing. It further found that she was not treated unfairly on the basis that an in-person hearing could have allowed the GD to notice that she was feeling unwell; she was represented by an experienced lawyer who could have asked for a delay or an adjournment.\n[18] The AD also found no error with the GD\u2019s assessment of the testimonies from Ms. Milner\u2019s aunt and from her former employer. It determined that it was not its role to second-guess the GD\u2019s assessment in the absence of an error, and that the GD\u2019s findings were supported by the evidence before it. The AD also found that the GD did not err by giving some weight to Ms. Milner\u2019s volunteer work. Even if she had given up most of her volunteer activities by the end of her MQP, the GD correctly inferred a degree of functionality, among other factors, from Ms. Milner\u2019s \u201cfairly robust volunteer schedule\u201d during a time where she \u201cclaims to have been increasingly debilitated\u201d (AD (A-16-21), Respondent\u2019s Record (A-16-21), at pp. 25-27, at paras. 31-35).\n[19] As for Ms. Milner\u2019s painkiller consumption, the AD further found no error with the GD\u2019s findings that there was no medical evidence that she was taking painkillers for generalized pain before the end of her MQP. Contrary to Ms. Milner\u2019s submissions, the AD saw no indication that the GD mischaracterized her doctor\u2019s notes or selectively considered the material before it. The AD similarly found that it could not overturn the decision of the GD simply because Ms. Milner disagrees with the weight given to her grief following her cousin\u2019s death. To the extent that the GD did not base its decision on a factual error, it was entitled to consider evidence as it saw fit. Finally, the AD found that the GD did not err in relying on Ms. Milner\u2019s family doctor\u2019s notes or drawing inferences from these notes, and saw no indication that it made illogical or unsupportable presumptions along the way.\nII. Issues [20] In her written and oral submissions, Ms. Milner raises many of the same arguments that she made before the AD. They mostly relate to alleged errors of fact and to the weight given to the evidence. In file A-178-20, she also makes new procedural fairness arguments. More particularly, she claims that she was treated unfairly first because the same member decided all three AD decisions, and second because the Minister\u2019s representative was allowed to ask her questions about privileged conversations she had with her lawyer.\n[21] Before grappling with Ms. Milner\u2019s various arguments, I shall first deal with the applicable standard of review. In a case such as this one, it is often the most determinative factor of the analysis. I will then turn to the merits of the two decisions under review, and to the AD\u2019s alleged breaches of procedural fairness.\nIII. Analysis A. The standard of review [22] The first thing to be emphasized is that the role of this Court, on judicial review, is not to assess the decision of the GD. The focus of our enquiry is the decision of the AD. In performing this role, the jurisdiction of the AD must also be kept in mind. Pursuant to subsection 58(1) of the DESDA, the AD is neither a reviewing court in the judicial sense of the word, nor is it conducting a de novo hearing: Glover v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FC 363 at para. 19; Marcia v. Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 1367 at para. 34; Canada (Attorney General) v. Jean, 2015 FCA 242 at para. 19. Specifically, the AD can only intervene if it finds that the GD (1) acted unfairly, (2) erred in law (whether or not the error appears on the face of the record), or (3) \u201cbased its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it\u201d.\n[23] It is by now well established that AD decisions are reviewable on the standard of reasonableness: see, for example, Atkinson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2014 FCA 187 at paras. 24-32; Garvey v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 118 at para. 1 [Garvey]; Sjogren v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 157 at para. 6; Parks v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FCA 91 at para. 8 [Parks]; Stavropoulos v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FCA 109 at para. 11; Riccio v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 108 at para. 5; Mudie v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 239 at para. 18, leave to appeal to the Supreme Court refused, 2022 CanLII 74314 (S.C.C.); Balkanyi v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 164 at paras. 12 and 13; Canada (Attorney General) v. Ibrahim, 2023 FCA 204 at para. 13. The question to be decided, therefore, is not whether Ms. Milner was entitled to a disability pension, but whether the AD\u2019s decision to confirm the GD\u2019s decision on the basis of no unfairness, error in law or erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner, and the reasons for so deciding, are reasonable. As the Supreme Court stated in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at paras. 83 and 84 [Vavilov], the task of a reviewing court is not to decide the issue according to its own yardstick, but to approach the reasons provided by the administrative decision-maker with \u201crespectful attention\u201d, with a view to understanding both the chain of analysis and the conclusion. Needless to say, the threshold is high to show that a decision is unreasonable.\n[24] As for questions of procedural fairness, they must be reviewed on the correctness standard: Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa, 2009 SCC 12 at para. 43; Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 at para. 54. Accordingly, this Court owes no deference to the AD and must determine whether the AD itself breached Ms. Milner\u2019s right to procedural fairness. On the other hand, this Court must also decide whether the AD acted reasonably in refusing to find that the GD acted unfairly.\nB. Are the AD decisions reasonable? (1) A-178-20 [25] Pursuant to paragraph 66(1)(b) of the DESDA, as it read at the relevant time, the SST could rescind or amend a decision if it was presented with a new material fact that was not discoverable at the time of the hearing with the exercise of reasonable diligence. This is a narrow exception to the principle that SST decisions are binding and final, subject only to statutory appeal or judicial review: Canada (Attorney General) v. Jagpal, 2008 FCA 38 at para. 27. A new fact will be \u201cmaterial\u201d if it could reasonably be expected to have affected the outcome of the hearing: Kent v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 FCA 420 at para. 34 [Kent]. This is a question of mixed fact and law (see Mazzotta v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 297 at para. 37 [Mazzotta]), and in the present case, a fact will be material if it is related to Ms. Milner\u2019s capacity as of December 31, 2003 (the end of her MQP). As for discoverability, Ms. Milner must show that the new fact could not have been discovered \u201cwith the exercise of reasonable diligence\u201d at the time of the hearing. This has been characterized as a question of fact (Mazzotta, at para. 37), or as a highly fact-driven question of mixed fact and law (Carepa v. Canada (Minister of Social Development), 2006 FC 1319 at paras. 17 and 18, citing Taylor v. Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development), 2005 FCA 293 at para. 12 [Taylor]). In a case like this one, discoverability will usually involve knowledge of the document, steps taken to discover it, and the justification as to why it was not produced at the hearing.\n[26] After having carefully considered Ms. Milner\u2019s oral and written submissions, I am unable to find in her favour. Ms. Milner\u2019s submissions amount, by and large, to mere disagreements with the AD\u2019s assessment of the GD\u2019s decision. This is not sufficient for a reviewing court to intervene. Before setting aside a decision on the basis that it is unreasonable, the reviewing court must be satisfied that the alleged flaws or shortcomings are not merely peripheral to the merits of the decision but rather, sufficiently significant to strip it of the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility and transparency: Vavilov at para. 100. This is a high threshold to meet, especially in the context of such an exceptional recourse as that set out in paragraph 66(1)(b) of the DESDA.\n[27] I have summarized in considerable detail the decisions of the GD and the AD in this file to show that Ms. Milner\u2019s arguments have already been carefully considered and dealt with. It is not for this Court to make its own assessment of the GD\u2019s decision, nor to reconsider the AD\u2019s decision against its own conclusions: Parks at para. 8. As this Court stated in Kent at para. 35, the test for determining the existence of new facts must be applied in a flexible manner, such that it allows for the balancing of the Minister\u2019s legitimate interest in the finality of decisions and the need to encourage claimants to put their best foot forward, and the equally legitimate interest of claimants in having their claims assessed fairly and reasonably.\n[28] Ms. Milner claims that the AD erred in many respects in concluding that the GD did not commit any errors in finding that she failed to present new material facts that would justify reopening its August 2018 decision. I will now briefly deal with these alleged errors.\n[29] Ms. Milner first submits that her family doctor\u2019s report dated July 15, 2019 did not exist at the time of the initial hearing and should have been allowed as a new fact as it supplements the record with allegedly new findings with respect to her health predicaments that would have predated the end of her MQP. The AD agreed with the GD that the report\u2019s content could have been discovered at the time of the initial hearing before the GD, and that the file already contained many other reports that covered similar information as the family doctor\u2019s post-hearing letter. This finding is consistent with previous decisions of this Court, according to which medical reports that merely reiterate what is already known or has been diagnosed will not be considered evidence of new facts: see, for example, Taylor at para. 13; Canada (Attorney General) v. MacRAE, 2008 FCA 82 at para. 17.\n[30] As for Ms. Milner\u2019s blood test results and prescription records, the GD had found that it was discoverable at the time of the hearing. The AD could reasonably find that there was no basis to intervene in that decision. These reports were clearly discoverable since Ms. Milner must have been aware that she had undergone investigations and taken medications. As noted by the AD, even if she might not have had the knowledge or capacity to obtain that information, she was represented by counsel whose role was to help her obtain and produce relevant documents in advance of the hearing before the GD. The same is true of Ms. Milner\u2019s 2003 emergency room records; not only were these reports discoverable at the time of the initial GD hearing because Ms. Milner and her lawyer knew about the accident, but the information about the motor vehicle accident and her resulting injuries were already before the GD.\n[31] With regard to the letter from Ms. Milner\u2019s gastroenterologist dated November 20, 2018, which provides that she tested positive for H. Pylori and that she likely acquired this infection in childhood, the AD could reasonably conclude that there was no reason to interfere with the GD\u2019s finding that this information was not material. It is an applicant\u2019s capacity to work due to disability that determines whether a disability is severe under the CPP, not the diagnosis of a disease per se: see Klabouch v. Canada (Social Development), 2008 FCA 33 at para. 14. As noted by the AD, even if we accept that Ms. Milner was infected with H. Pylori as a child and that H. Pylori is associated with PVD, a positive test for H. Pylori says nothing about whether PVD produces disabling symptoms and, if so, whether disabling symptoms were present on or before December 31, 2003. Ms. Milner has not convinced me that this finding was unreasonable.\n[32] Ms. Milner also challenged the AD\u2019s finding that the GD did not err in its treatment of her mental health narrative, which she submitted in advance of the second GD hearing. In that statement, Ms. Milner provided her written testimony of her personal experiences with grief and addiction between January 2003 and the second GD hearing, explaining that she was not well enough to obtain medical records documenting her mental health issues. The testimony also stated that she asked her lawyer to postpone the hearing, but her lawyer advised against it. The GD determined that counsel could have requested an adjournment to adduce the missing medical records, and the AD reasonably found no error in that decision. Not only had counsel made requests for medical documents that were not received by the GD at the time of the initial hearing, but counsel is presumed to be competent and to know that she could have requested an adjournment.\n[33] Finally, Ms. Milner argues that the GD erred in determining that it would hold a separate hearing on the merits of her CPP claim only if it found that she established a new material fact, and that the AD unreasonably found no basis to intervene in that decision. Once again, I am of the view that this argument is without merit. It is clear that a decision to reconsider a prior decision based on new material facts involves two distinct decisions: Kent at para. 18. First, a decision-maker must determine whether there are new material facts; if not, the original decision will stand. It is only if new material facts are established that the decision-maker will go on to reassess the applicant\u2019s pension entitlement on the basis of the new material facts and of the existing record. There would be no point in assessing the potential impact of an applicant\u2019s new evidence if it was later to be found that this new evidence does not meet the test for materiality or discoverability. While the GD member alluded to the cost of a second hearing, it is clear that his primary concern was to proceed in the most logical and efficient way.\n[34] Before this Court, Ms. Milner raises two new arguments of procedural fairness. First, she claims that she was treated unfairly on the basis that the same member decided all three appeal decisions. She also raises this argument in her application for judicial review in Court file number A-16-21. Second, she contends that she was treated unfairly because the GD member allowed the Minister\u2019s representative to ask her questions about privileged conversations she had with her lawyer. The GD member did advise her that these conversations were privileged and that she did not need to disclose that information, but only after she provided two preliminary answers and she was put in the difficult position to either answer the questions or be seen to avoid the questions.\n[35] I agree with the respondent that an alleged breach of procedural fairness must be raised at the earliest practicable opportunity: Hennessey v. Canada, 2016 FCA 180 at para. 21; Benitez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 461 at para. 220, aff\u2019d 2007 FCA 199, leave to appeal to the Supreme Court refused, 2007 CanLII 55337 (S.C.C.); Mohammadian v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] 3 F.C. 371 at para. 25 (Fed. T.D.). Ms. Milner knew that the same member presided over her case three times, yet did not raise any concern or object that it was improper for the member to preside until her appeals were dismissed. Similarly, she knew that she had been asked questions about conversations she had with her lawyer during the last GD hearing, yet she did not raise that argument before the AD. Moreover, she was advised by the GD member that the questions about her conversations with her lawyer were privileged, but nevertheless answered the questions and told the member that she did not mind discussing those conversations. It is therefore too late to argue that her right to procedural fairness has been breached.\n(2) A-16-21 [36] The CPP is a compulsory contributory and earnings-related scheme. Three criteria must be satisfied to qualify for a CPP disability pension, pursuant to subsection 42(2), paragraph 44(1)(b), and subsection 44(2) of the Canada Pension Plan, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-8 (CPP Act). An applicant must meet the contributory requirements, be found disabled within the meaning of the CPP Act, and continue to be disabled. In the case at bar, it is the second condition that is at play. It is not in dispute that Ms. Milner meets the contributory requirements, and that the latest date by which she must be found disabled to be entitled to a CPP is December 31, 2003 (MQP).\n[37] To be \u201cdisabled\u201d, Ms. Milner must prove through medical evidence and with due regard to the \u201creal world context\u201d that she was more likely than not to have a disability that was severe and prolonged on or before the end of her MQP: see Warren v. Canada (Attorney General), 2008 FCA 377 at para. 4; Canada (Attorney General) v. Angell, 2020 FC 1093 at para. 40; Bungay v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FCA 47 at para. 8; Villani v. Canada (Attorney General), 2001 FCA 248 at paras. 32 and 38 [Villani]. A disability is severe if it causes Ms. Milner \u201cto be incapable regularly of pursuing any substantially gainful occupation\u201d: CPP Act, subparagraph 42(2)(a)(i); Villani at paras. 44 and 50. Where there is evidence of some capacity for work, disability claimants must show that efforts to obtain and maintain employment have been unsuccessful because of their health conditions. A disability is prolonged if it is \u201clikely to be long, continued and of indefinite duration or likely to result in death\u201d: CPP Act, subparagraph 42(2)(a)(ii); Litke v. Canada (Human Resources and Social Development), 2008 FCA 366 at para. 5.\n[38] Ms. Milner submits that the AD made several errors of fact. She claims, for example, that too much weight was given to her volunteer activities, without taking into account that she eventually had to give them up by the end of her MQP due to her pain. The GD did indeed find that Ms. Milner appeared to have been doing a significant amount of volunteer work in the years 2000 to 2002. However, as reasonably noted by the AD, the GD did not base its decision solely on Ms. Milner\u2019s volunteer involvement, but also on evidence that many of her medical conditions arose after the MQP, the absence of compelling signs of disability in her family doctor\u2019s notes from 2003 to 2004, and inconsistencies that raised questions about the reliability of her testimony. Moreover, the AD could reasonably find that the GD was entitled to consider Ms. Milner\u2019s volunteer work when assessing whether she retained work capacity; while volunteer work cannot be the sole basis to deny benefits, it can be used to infer functionality when considered in combination with other factors. The evidence that Ms. Milner was engaged in volunteer work while she was working for an insurance brokerage in 2001 was considered relevant to assessing her work capacity by the GD, since it contradicted testimony that her job ended because she was medically unable to complete brokerage courses on top of her full-time work. The AD was entitled to find no error in that factual assessment.\n[39] Ms. Milner also complains about the weight given to her biological aunt\u2019s and former employer\u2019s testimonies. Her aunt\u2019s testimony was to the effect that, like her niece, she suffers from PVD and that it took a long time before she was properly diagnosed. As for her former employer, he testified that she often missed work and ultimately, was unable to get through the courses required to become a licensed broker. The GD did not place much weight on Ms. Milner\u2019s aunt\u2019s testimony, because the issue has never been whether and when she had PVD, but rather when she became impaired to the point where she could no longer regularly perform substantially gainful employment. As for her former employer\u2019s testimony, the GD did not deny that Ms. Milner was experiencing pain at the time but found that there were likely other reasons than impairment to explain why she did not become a broker.\n[40] In my view, the AD could reasonably refuse to interfere with the GD\u2019s assessment of the evidence. Paragraph 58(1)(c) of the DESDA provides that only factual errors made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the evidence on which a decision is based constitute errors of fact. This is a high threshold. As this Court stated in Garvey at paragraph 6, a finding will be perverse, capricious or made without regard to the evidence if it squarely contradicts or is unsupported by the evidence. In the case at bar, Ms. Milner\u2019s arguments before the AD amounted to mere disagreement with the GD\u2019s assessment of the testimonies given by her aunt and former employer. The GD\u2019s factual findings were supported by the evidence, and the fact that the AD or, for that matter, this Court, may have decided the case differently is no ground to interfere with the GD\u2019s decision: see Cameron v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 100 at para. 2; Nelson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 222 at para. 17.\n[41] The same is true with respect to Ms. Milner\u2019s argument that the GD did not give enough weight to her grief following her cousin\u2019s death, and erred in the inferences it drew from her family doctor\u2019s office notes. Once again, the AD determined that the GD was fully aware of and considered the evidence that was put forward by Ms. Milner with respect to her grief-related stress, and that it was not its proper role to revisit how the GD chose to weigh that evidence. Similarly, the AD found that the GD did not err in concluding, on the basis of Ms. Milner\u2019s family doctor\u2019s clinical notes, that she was not experiencing generalized pain (which formed the basis of her application for CPP benefits) or that she was not taking pain medication for generalized pain before the end of her MQP, and that Tylenol 3 was prescribed to address only localized pain until May 2004. There was no basis for the AD to set aside these conclusions, which were all supported by fulsome review of the evidence.\n[42] Finally, Ms. Milner submits that the AD incorrectly found that the GD did not breach her right to procedural fairness by holding a videoconference hearing. More specifically, she argues that if the hearing had been in person, the GD could have noticed that she was not well. Once again, this argument is without merit. First of all, as noted by the AD, Ms. Milner never insisted on an in-person hearing before the GD; on the contrary, she indicated in writing that she preferred to proceed either by videoconference or by personal appearance. The AD therefore correctly determined that the GD did nothing more than agree to one of Ms. Milner\u2019s stated preferences. Moreover, there is no indication that Ms. Milner insisted on an in-person hearing before the GD. Finally, the AD was correct in pointing out that she was represented by counsel before the GD; since lawyers are presumed to act in accordance with their client\u2019s instructions and best interests, the GD was justified to assume that she was ready to proceed in the absence of any request for a postponement or adjournment before or during the hearing.\nIV. Conclusion [43] For all the above reasons, I would dismiss these applications for judicial review, without costs. I realize that this is not the conclusion Ms. Milner hoped for. In light of the record that is before us, however, I am unable to find in her favour. As indicated above, I sympathize with her plight. However, I find that the decisions of the AD not to interfere with the GD\u2019s determinations that she failed to present new material facts and that she was not disabled within the meaning of the CPP by her MQP were reasonable.\n\u201cYves de Montigny\u201d\nC.J.\n\u201cI agree.\nGeorge R.

E-15 (the Act) be granted or to commence an appeal to the Tax Court of Canada was dismissed by the Tax Court of Canada (per Visser J., Tax Court File No. 2018-1186(GST)APP).\n[2] This is an appeal from the Order of the Tax Court dismissing the appellant\u2019s application. The issue in this appeal is whether the Tax Court judge erred in dismissing this application.\n[3] The following dates and events are relevant in this matter:\nDate\nEvent\nDecember 14, 2014\nA notice of reassessment was issued following the appellant\u2019s filing of its GST return for the reporting period from January 5, 2010 to December 31, 2010 (the Reporting Period). The GST return was filed in response to an arbitrary assessment issued on November 18, 2011. The Minister had previously requested, on two separate occasions, that the appellant file its GST return. This is the relevant notice of reassessment in this matter.\nNovember 2, 2015\nThe appellant submitted a notice of objection to the Minister.\nNovember 27, 2015\nThe Minister rejected the notice of objection because it was not filed within the time limit set out in subsection 301(1.1) of the Act (within 90 days after the date the notice of reassessment was sent to the appellant). The appellant was informed that it would have to request an extension of time to file the notice of objection. This application would have to be made within one year after the expiration of the time period within which the appellant could have filed an objection without an extension of time.\nJune 25, 2017\nThe appellant wrote to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) requesting that the CRA accept an amended return for the Reporting Period.\nJuly 27, 2017\nThe CRA informed the appellant that it would not be reassessed based on the amended return.\nOctober 23, 2017\nThe appellant submitted, to the Minister, a request for an extension of time to object in response to the letter from the CRA dated July 27, 2017.\nNovember 28, 2017\nThe Minister rejected the application on the basis that the time within which an application could have been made to object to the notice of reassessment (which was issued on December 14, 2014) expired on March 16, 2016 and therefore the request was too late.\nApril 5, 2018\nThe appellant filed the application with the Tax Court referred to in paragraph 1 above.\n[4] Subsection 304(5) of the Act provides that the Tax Court cannot grant an application to extend the time to object to an assessment unless the conditions set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) are satisfied. Paragraph (a) provides that the appellant must have filed its application to the Minister to extend the time to object within one year after the expiration of the time period within which the appellant could have filed an objection without an extension of time. The letter from the CRA dated July 27, 2017 is not an assessment. The relevant reassessment in this matter is dated December 14, 2014. The time period within which the appellant could have requested an extension of time to object to this reassessment expired on March 16, 2016.\n[5] Since the appellant only applied after March 16, 2016 to the Minister to request an extension of time to object to the relevant reassessment, there is no basis on which the Tax Court could have granted an extension of time for the appellant to object to this reassessment. The Tax Court did not err in dismissing this application.\n[6] Filing a valid notice of objection is a condition precedent to commencing an appeal to the Tax Court (Beima v. Canada, 2016 FCA 205, at paragraph 14). Since the appellant did not file a valid notice of objection, the time period to commence an appeal to the Tax Court has not commenced. As noted in Beima, at paragraph 14, \u201c[a]n extension of time is not available if the time period has not commenced\u201d.\n[7] The Act stipulates specific requirements for making an objection to the Minister and filing an appeal to the Tax Court. The appellant did not comply with these requirements. Neither the Tax Court nor this Court has the jurisdiction (either equitable or otherwise) to waive compliance with or modify these statutory requirements.\n[8] The Tax Court Judge did not err in dismissing the appellant\u2019s application for an extension of time to file an appeal to the Tax Court.\n[9] This appeal will be dismissed with costs.\n\"Wyman W.

(Micsau), through its shares in 3295940 Canada Inc. (3295 or the appellant), held an indirect minority stake in a generic drug business. The majority owner began negotiations to sell the business to a third party. Thus, Micsau had to sell its stake in the business.\n[2] Micsau wished to use the high tax cost in its 3295 shares. 3295\u2019s tax cost in the underlying business was much lower, so selling that stake through 3295 would have created a higher capital gain. Therefore, Micsau wished to sell its 3295 shares in order to use its high tax cost. For reasons I will explain below, Micsau could not sell its shares in 3295. Faced with these circumstances, Micsau initiated a series of transactions, which replicated the tax consequences of Micsau selling its 3295 shares.\n[3] To borrow liberally from one author, what should then have been a \u201cplain-vanilla tax\u2011planning opportunity\u201d whereby Micsau used its high cost to be taxed on its true economic gain ended up being, for the Tax Court of Canada, an abusive avoidance transaction by 3295: Eric Hamelin, \u201cGAAR Applicable to the Circular Payment of Capital Dividends\u201d (2023) 71:3 Can Tax J 859 at 868 [Hamelin].\n[4] In light of the true nature and overall result of the series of transactions, there was no abuse of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (the Act). For the following reasons, I would allow the appeal.\nI. Factual Background [5] Shakespeare once wrote that \u201cbrevity is the soul of wit\u201d. Much as I wish to implement this maxim, I must recount the facts in some depth. I omit certain minor details for simplicity. Keen readers may consult an even more fulsome recitation of the facts in the Partial Agreed Statement of Facts (PASOF) attached to the Tax Court\u2019s decision. Unless otherwise specified, the facts are taken from the PASOF.\nA. Initial Situation [6] Before the series of transactions, the corporate structure was as follows.\n[7] As illustrated, Micsau wholly owned 3295, and 3295 owned a minority stake in Holdings. RoundTable, an American investment fund, owned the remaining shares and thus controlled Holdings. Holdings owned an operating company (Sabex 2002), which carried on a generic drug business.\n[8] As also illustrated, Micsau\u2019s shares in 3295 had an adjusted cost base (ACB) of $48.1M and a fair market value (FMV) of $101.8M. 3295\u2019s shares in Holdings had an ACB of $4M and a FMV of $88.5M. The difference between the ACB of the shares in Holdings and those in 3295 is due to a transaction that occurred two years before the relevant period when Micsau bought shares in 3295 from another shareholder and became 3295\u2019s sole shareholder. Micsau paid $47.46M for these additional shares. As for the difference between the FMV of the shares in Holdings and those in 3295, it is attributable to 3295 having $13.3M of cash.\nB. Roundtable Negotiates to Sell Holdings [9] In 2004, RoundTable began negotiations to sell 100% ownership of Holdings to a third party, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (Novartis). One option for executing this sale was for Micsau to sell its shares in 3295 to Novartis. This option would have generated a capital gain of $53.7M ($101.8M \u2013 $48.1M). Comparatively, 3295 selling its shares in Holdings would have been inefficient: these shares\u2019 low ACB would have generated a capital gain of $84.5M ($88.5M \u2013 $4M). With this information in mind, Micsau\u2019s business and tax adviser submitted to RoundTable\u2014which had the exclusive right to negotiate with Novartis and to make decisions regarding the sale to Novartis\u2014the following alternative transactions:\na)Micsau sells its shares in 3295 to Novartis;\nb)3295 merges with Holdings: This merger would create a new, amalgamated corporation (AmalCo). Micsau would have the same ACB in its AmalCo shares as its ACB in its 3295 shares. Micsau would sell its AmalCo shares;\nc)A tuck-under reorganization is undertaken: Micsau would transfer its 3295 shares to Holdings in consideration for shares in Holdings on a taxable basis, allowing Micsau to use its high ACB in computing its resulting capital gain. Micsau would then sell its Holdings shares to Novartis. Holdings and 3295 would be in cross\u2011ownership, but the cross ownership could be eliminated without additional tax through an amalgamation; or\nd)Micsau sells its 3295 shares to RoundTable: RoundTable could then wind up 3295, the ACB of 3295\u2019s shares would transfer to the Holdings shares, and RoundTable would sell the Holdings shares to Novartis.\nUnder each of these options, Micsau would use its high ACB to realize a $53.7M gain, and Novartis would acquire 100% of the shares in Holdings.\n(Transcript of hearing of September 8, 2020, Appeal Book, vol. 2 at 1032, 1034\u201336, 1040\u201343 [Sept. 8 Transcript]; Transcript of hearing of September 9, 2020, Appeal Book, vol. 2 at 1149\u201350 [Sept. 9 Transcript]; 3295940 Canada Inc. v. The Queen, 2022 TCC 68 at para. 152 [TCC Reasons].)\n[10] It appears that RoundTable, not wanting to impede the momentum of the sale, did not put the first three transactions to Novartis. Nevertheless, RoundTable said Novartis was unwilling to acquire the 3295 shares due to potential legacy liabilities. The last proposal involved RoundTable, not Novartis, acquiring shares in 3295. RoundTable rejected the proposal, saying it did not want to be left with a Canadian subsidiary (3295) following the sale of Holdings: Sept. 8 Transcript at 1032\u201335, 1043\u201344, 1067\u201368; Sept. 9 Transcript at 1114\u201315, 1153\u201355.\n[11] Once Novartis and RoundTable agreed to terms for the sale of Holdings, Micsau\u2019s adviser was able to speak to Novartis. Assuming that Novartis did not want to acquire the 3295 shares directly or indirectly, the adviser proposed selling the shares of a new corporation: Sept. 8 Transcript at 1035; Sept. 9 Transcript at 1114\u201315.\n[12] Novartis accepted the proposal in exchange for a $1.5M reduction of the purchase price: Sept. 9 Transcript at 1108\u201309. It is not clear from the evidence how this reduction of $1.5M was reflected in the numbers below. However, this is not material to the resolution of the issue before this Court.\n[13] As a result, the following transactions occurred.\nC. Series of Transactions (1) Micsau creates 31.5M Class D shares [14] Micsau exchanged its shares in 3295 for (1) Class D preferred shares with $31.5M of ACB and FMV and (2) 100 common shares with $16.6M of ACB and $70.3M of FMV. This had the effect of transferring a portion of Micsau\u2019s high ACB to the newly-created Class D shares.\n(2) Micsau transfers the Class D shares to 4244 [15] Micsau transferred the Class D shares in 3295, for $31.5M, to a newly created subsidiary: 4244851 Canada Inc. (4244). In consideration, 4244 issued to Micsau Class D shares with an ACB and FMV of $31.5M. Micsau\u2019s Class D shares in 3295 had an ACB equal to the price at which it transferred those shares to 4244; consequently, this transaction created no capital gain. The resulting corporate diagram, which excludes RoundTable for simplicity, was as follows:\n[16] I wish to pause here to note a foundational point. The proposal Novartis accepted was the sale of shares in a new corporation (4244) for $88.5M. As we will see, two \u201clots\u201d of 4244 shares will be sold to Novartis. The first lot is the Micsau\u2019s 31.5M Class D shares in 4244.\n(3) 3295 sells its Holdings shares to 4244\n[17] 3295 transferred its Holdings shares, worth $88.5M, to 4244. To make this an even trade, 4244 issued $88.5M worth of shares: (1) 57M Class D shares, worth $57M and (2) 31.5M common shares, worth $31.5M. As the Act permits, 3295 elected to recognize, not $88.5M, but $57M in proceeds of disposition. Consequently, 3295 realized a $53M capital gain ($57M \u2013 $4M). That gain is roughly the gain Micsau would have realized if it had sold its 3295 shares to Novartis. Due to the election, 3295\u2019s shares in 4244 had $57M of ACB, which went to the 57M Class D shares. This left 3295\u2019s 31.5M common shares with no ACB.\n[18] As the Act provides, half of 3295\u2019s gain was taxed, and half was added to 3295\u2019s Capital Dividend Account (CDA). The CDA represents amounts, including capital gains\u2019 non-taxable portion, which a corporation can distribute tax-free. Accordingly, 3295\u2019s capital gain increased the CDA balance by $26.5M, yielding a total CDA of $32.28M.\n[19] The corporate diagram after these transactions was as follows:\n[20] I pause to note that the second \u201clot\u201d of 4244 shares that will be sold to Novartis is the 57M Class D shares that 3295 acquired when it sold the Holdings shares to 4244.\n(4) Eliminating the cross-ownership between 3295 and 4244 [21] Since Micsau had been told Novartis did not want to own shares in 3295 directly or indirectly, the series could not contemplate Novartis purchasing a company (4244) that was in a cross-ownership with 3295. Hence, 4244 and 3295 eliminated the cross-ownership before the sale to Novartis.\n[22] It is important to recognize that eliminating the cross-ownership did not change the value of what Novartis wanted to purchase. Irrespective of the cross-ownership, the underlying drug business\u2019 value was $88.5M. That value was reflected in the two \u201clots\u201d of shares: (1) Micsau\u2019s 31.5M Class D shares in 4244, worth $31.5M and (2) 3295\u2019s 57M Class D shares in 4244, worth $57M.\n[23] The cross-ownership was eliminated through a cross-redemption. First, 3295 redeemed 4244\u2019s Class D shares for a promissory note of $31.5M. Under the Act, this resulted in 4244 being deemed to have received a $31.5M dividend from 3295. 3295 elected to treat this dividend as a capital dividend. Consequently, the dividend was not taxable, and 4244\u2019s CDA increased by $31.5M (with 3295\u2019s CDA decreasing correspondingly). Second, 4244 redeemed 3295\u2019s common shares, also for a promissory note of $31.5M. This resulted in 3295 being deemed to have received a $31.5M dividend from 4244. 4244 elected to treat this dividend as a capital dividend. Consequently, the dividend was not taxable, 4244\u2019s CDA balance was eliminated, and 3295\u2019s CDA was restored. Finally, 3295 and 4244 offset the two promissory notes. After these transactions, the corporate diagram was as follows:\n(5) Micsau transfers its 4244 shares to 3295\n[24] Micsau transferred to 3295 the first lot of shares\u2014the 31.5M Class D shares in 4244. In exchange, 3295 issued 31.5M Class D shares to Micsau. The corporate diagram after these transactions was as follows:\n[25] As the diagram illustrates, 3295 owned all the 4244 Class D shares, which had $88.5M of FMV and ACB. These shares come from the two lots discussed above. The first lot, the 31.5M Class D shares, are the ones Micsau obtained by using its high ACB in the first steps of the series, described at paragraphs [14] and [15] above. The second lot, the 57M Class D shares, comprises shares on which 3295 paid full tax in step 3 of the series, described at paragraphs [17] and [18].\n(6) 3295 sells both lots to Novartis\n[26] 3295 sold all its shares in 4244 to Novartis for $88.5M. Because the shares\u2019 sale price and ACB were equal, 3295 realized no additional capital gain from this sale.\n(7) 3295 sends Micsau $31.5M of cash\n[27] Finally, 3295 redeemed, for $31.5M, the Class D shares it issued to Micsau in step 5 of the series, described in paragraph [24]. 3295 used the funds it received from Novartis on the sale. This transaction resulted in no tax liability. The corporate structure after the series of transactions can be illustrated as follows:\nD. The Minister\u2019s Reassessment [28] The Minister of National Revenue (Minister) reassessed 3295 pursuant to the General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) in section 245 of the Act. The GAAR applies when a series of transactions meets three requirements. First, a tax benefit must arise from the series of transactions. Second, there must be avoidance, meaning the series was undertaken primarily for the purpose of obtaining a tax benefit. Third, the avoidance must be abusive. Abuse occurs when the result of the series frustrates the object, spirit, and purpose of a provision of the Act or of the Act as a whole.\n[29] The Minister\u2019s reassessment applied the GAAR to add a $31.5M of capital gain to 3295\u2019s income. The Minister said Micsau and 3295 carried out a series of avoidance transactions that resulted in a tax benefit\u2014namely, a $31.5M reduction in the capital gain 3295 would have realized if it had directly sold its shares in Holdings to Novartis. The Minister said the series allowed 3295 to abuse:\na)the Act\u2019s regime regarding the taxation of capital gains, found in paragraphs 3(b), 38(1), 39(1)(a), and 40(1)(a);\nb)the Act\u2019s scheme governing capital dividends provided for in subsections 83(2) and 89(1); and\nc)subsection 55(2).\n[30] Before reviewing the Tax Court\u2019s analysis, I will briefly summarize these provisions and the context in which they operate.\nII. Overview of Allegedly Abused Provisions A. Capital Gains Regime [31] Capital gains represent the accrued economic gain a taxpayer realizes when she disposes of a capital asset: paragraph 39(1)(a). One calculates capital gains as the proceeds of disposition (POD) minus the adjusted cost base (ACB): subsection 40(1). For example, if a taxpayer buys a capital asset for $100 and sells it for $150, she realizes a $50 capital gain; that is, $150 POD minus $100 ACB. Only half of capital gains are taxable: paragraph 38(a). Thus, in our example, the taxpayer\u2019s taxable capital gain is only $25; that is, half of the $50 capital gain.\nB. Capital Dividends [32] Parliament\u2019s objective is to tax half of capital gains, whether they are earned directly by an individual or indirectly through a corporation. Where a private corporation realizes a capital gain, the non-taxable portion is added to the corporation\u2019s Capital Dividend Account (CDA). As mentioned, the CDA represents amounts, including capital gains\u2019 non-taxable portion, which a corporation can distribute to its shareholders tax-free via capital dividends. Without this feature, the system would tax the non-taxable portion of the capital gain. When the distributing corporation pays a capital dividend to a corporate shareholder, the distributing corporation\u2019s CDA decreases by the amount of the dividend, and the corporate shareholder\u2019s CDA increases by that amount. These provisions are found in subsections 83(2) and 89(1).\nC. Subsection 55(2) [33] Subsection 55(2) operates in the context of the intercorporate dividend regime. Key to that regime is subsection 112(1), which says that a taxable dividend that a corporate shareholder receives from a Canadian corporation is deductible from that shareholder\u2019s income. As a result, the corporate shareholder receives this dividend tax-free. The rationale is that this dividend has been paid from after-tax earnings; taxing it again in the hands of the recipient corporation would result in double taxation.\n[34] Subsection 55(2) serves a dual purpose.\n[35] First, it prevents \u201ccapital gains stripping\u201d. Capital gains stripping happens when a corporation, before its shares are sold, reduces its value by paying an intercorporate dividend to its corporate shareholder, thereby converting a capital gain into a tax-free intercorporate dividend. An example can illustrate the effect of subsection 55(2). Suppose ACo wholly owns BCo. BCo has an asset worth $100. BCo pays a $99 intercorporate dividend to ACo, which receives that dividend tax-free. ACo could then sell its shares in BCo to a third party for $1. Using this manoeuvre, ACo would turn a $100 sale into a $1 sale and, in so doing, transform what would have been a taxable capital gain into a tax-free intercorporate dividend. Subsection 55(2) prevents this sort of tax plan by deeming the $99 dividend to be part of ACo\u2019s capital gain from its sale of BCo\u2019s shares.\n[36] Second, subsection 55(2) protects the tax-free flow of dividends attributable to income that has already been taxed in the corporation paying the dividend: Canada v. Kruco Inc., 2003 FCA 284 at para. 32 [Kruco]. To continue with the previous example, if BCo had $10 of after\u2011tax income, it could pay a $10 dividend to ACo prior to its sale. Subsection 55(2) would allow such a dividend. The underlying assumption is that dividends in excess of after-tax profits\u2014in our example dividends in excess of $10\u2014represent the untaxed appreciation of capital assets: Kruco at para. 32; Ottawa Air Cargo Centre Ltd. v. The Queen, 2007 TCC 193 at para. 27, aff\u2019d 2008 FCA 54.\n[37] With this legislative context in mind, I now turn to the Tax Court\u2019s decision.\nIII. Tax Court Decision [38] The Tax Court had to decide whether the GAAR applied to the series of transactions. 3295 conceded the first two elements of the GAAR: the existence of a tax benefit and avoidance. The only remaining issue was whether the series of transactions was abusive.\n[39] The Tax Court ruled that the series abused subsection 55(2) and the scheme governing capital dividends: TCC Reasons at paras. 118, 120, 129\u2013132, 144. The Tax Court found that the object, spirit, and purpose of subsections 55(2), 83(2) and 89(1), collectively, is to \u201cprevent a taxpayer from using a tax-free dividend to avoid the capital gain inherent in the shares of a corporation that is attributable to an unrealized appreciation\u201d: TCC Reasons at para. 118. According to the Tax Court, the cross-redemption dividends between 3295 and 4244 were abusive because they circumvented subsection 55(2) and resulted in 3295 increasing the ACB of its shares in Holdings, even though subparagraphs 88(1)(c)(ii) and (iii) did not allow for such an increase: TCC Reasons at paras. 118, 120\u2013123, 136\u2013144.\n[40] 3295 argued that the tax plan was not abusive because alternative transactions, described in paragraph [9] above, could have been implemented and resulted in less tax liability. The Tax Court said these alternative scenarios were not valid comparisons because \u201cthey related to the sale of the [3295] shares\u201d and because \u201cit was shown that the sale of Holdings\u2019 shares was essential\u201d: TCC Reasons at para. 159.\n[41] Hence, the Tax Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the Minister\u2019s reassessment.\nIV. Issue and Standard of Review [42] The only issue is whether the series is abusive.\n[43] The standard of review for GAAR cases on appeal depends on what stage of the abuse analysis a party challenges. The abuse analysis occurs in two stages. The first is to determine the object, spirit, and purpose of the provisions at issue. This first stage is a question of law, subject to correctness review by appellate courts: Deans Knight Income Corp. v. Canada, 2023 SCC 16 at para. 78 [Deans Knight]; Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 SCC 49 at para. 50; Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54 at para. 44 [Canada Trustco]; Housen v Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 at paras. 8, 26\u201337 [Housen]. The second stage is to determine whether the transactions in issue are abusive. This inquiry is \u201cnecessarily fact intensive\u201d and is thus reviewable only for palpable and overriding error, absent an extricable error of law: Deans Knight at para. 121; Canada Trustco at para. 44; Canada v. Oxford Properties Group Inc., 2018 FCA 30 at para. 39 [Oxford Properties]; Housen at para. 10.\n[44] A trial judge\u2019s failure to consider the overall result of a series of transactions is an extricable error of law. For instance, in Oxford Properties, this Court accorded no deference to the portion of the trial judge\u2019s abuse analysis that failed to consider the overall result of the series of transactions: Oxford Properties at paras. 107\u2013113. Likewise, a trial judge\u2019s failure to consider the true, overall nature of a tax plan constitutes an error of law: Canada v. Microbjo Properties Inc., 2023 FCA 157 [Microbjo]. In Microbjo, No\u00ebl CJ explained the point as follows:\nThe Tax Court\u2019s failure to take into account the true nature of the plan amounts to an error of law. Indeed, as was explained by the Supreme Court in Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc., 1997 CanLII 385 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748, 144 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (paras. 39 and 41), a tribunal that fails to consider evidence that the law requires it to consider commits an error of law.\n(Microbjo at para. 74)\nV. Analysis [45] The Tax Court failed to consider the entire series of transactions and its overall result. This error of law led the Court to misconstrue the abuse analysis and improperly reject alternative transactions that would have confirmed that the series did not abuse subsection 55(2) or the scheme governing capital dividends.\nA. The Tax Court Misconstrued the Abuse Analysis [46] The Supreme Court and this Court have held that, to determine whether transactions forming part of a series are abusive, one must consider the \u201centire series of transactions\u201d or its \u201coverall result\u201d: Lipson et al. v. The Queen, 2009 SCC 1 at para. 34; Copthorne Holdings Ltd. v. The Queen, 2011 SCC 63 at para. 71 [Copthorne]; Canada v. Landrus, 2009 FCA 113 at paras. 66\u201367; Birchcliff Energy Ltd. v. Canada, 2019 FCA 151 at paras. 27\u201328 [Birchcliff]; Oxford Properties at paras. 106\u2013110, 118\u2013119.\n[47] Here, the series\u2019 overall result did not shortchange the Minister. Before the series, a $53.7M capital gain would have been realized if Micsau had sold its 3295 shares to Novartis. After the series, a $53M capital gain was realized and taxed. Similarly, the difference between the capital gain taxed ($53M) and the purchase price paid by Novartis ($88.5M) did not escape taxation. It is simply the use of ACB legitimately acquired: $4M in the case of 3295, and $31.5M in the case of Micsau.\n[48] Instead of considering the entire series of transactions and its overall result, the Tax Court limited its analysis to the moment in the series when 3295, through the cross-redemption capital dividend, could be said to have reduced the capital gain that it would have realized from disposing of its common shares in 4244 immediately before the dividend. However, had the Tax Court considered the entire series, it could have only concluded that the cross-redemption capital dividend did not reduce 3295\u2019s capital gain and, therefore, did not abuse subsection 55(2).\n[49] A brief hypothetical illustrates that the cross-redemption did not decrease 3295\u2019s capital gain. Technically, Novartis could have purchased the 4244 shares without the cross-redemption step at paragraph [23]. This would have transferred control of 4244 to Novartis, like the impugned series of transactions, and 3295\u2019s capital gain would have remained $53M ($57M POD minus $4M ACB). As for Micsau, it would have had no gain from the sale of its 31.5M Class D shares in 4244 because those shares\u2019 ACB was equal to their FMV. After Novartis\u2019 purchase, 4244 and 3295 could have eliminated the cross-ownership using a cross-redemption. Just as the cross-ownership did not increase the value of the drug business Novartis wanted to purchase, the cross-redemption did not decrease the value of the shares sold to Novartis.\n[50] The Minister argues that the cross-redemption capital dividend decreased 3295\u2019s capital gain by $31.5M. I disagree. The $31.5M reduction the Minister complains about does not stem from the cross-redemption; it stems from selling the first lot of shares. These shares derived their FMV and ACB from Micsau lawfully isolating $31.5M of legitimately-obtained ACB and FMV into new, separate Class D shares.\n[51] A more technically precise way of explaining the provenance of the $31.5M reduction the Minister complains about is as follows. Recall that the $88.5M of 4244 shares Novartis purchased came from two lots: the first lot was Micsau\u2019s 31.5M Class D shares, and the second lot was 3295\u2019s 57M Class D shares. The second lot, worth $57M, was properly taxed; the Minister concedes that point. The remaining contention relates to the first lot. This lot derived its $31.5M FMV and ACB from the series\u2019 first two steps, in which (1) Micsau isolated $31.5M of legitimately-obtained ACB and FMV into Class D shares, then (2) exchanged them for 4244 Class D shares, which also had $31.5M ACB and FMV. Just before the sale to Novartis, Micsau transferred these 4244 shares to 3295, and 3295 sold that lot to Novartis for $31.5M. It follows that Micsau using its high ACB explains why the first lot did not create any capital gain; this has nothing to do with the cross-redemption capital dividend.\n[52] To alleviate any doubt about the series\u2019 purpose and effect, it bears noting that instead of transferring its 4244 shares to 3295 for 3295 to sell to Novartis, Micsau could have sold its shares in 4244 directly to Novartis for $31.5M. Had Micsau done so, it would have received the $31.5M directly from Novartis, and 3295\u2019s gain would have remained $53M: Hamelin at 874. This different way of proceeding would have made it clear that the series\u2019 purpose and effect was to allow Micsau to use its high ACB, not to abusively reduce 3295\u2019s capital gain. Indeed, this purpose and effect correspond exactly to the appellant\u2019s tax planning documents: Appeal Book, Vol. 1, Tab F.5 at 829.\n[53] To conclude: the series implemented the sale of shares in a new corporation, 4244, for $88.5M. The series involved 3295 receiving $57M and being taxed on a $53M capital gain ($57M POD minus $4M ACB). The series also involved Micsau receiving $31.5M while using $31.5M of its ACB. Before the series, Micsau\u2019s 3295 shares had an ACB of $48.1M and a FMV of $101.8M, and so had an accrued gain of $53.7M. After the series, Micsau received $31.5M from 3295, Micsau\u2019s ACB and FMV in 3295 was reduced by $31.5M, and Micsau\u2019s accrued gain in those shares remained $53.7M ($16.6M ACB and $70.3M FMV). Thus, Micsau stands to be taxed on $53.7M if it sells its 3295 shares after the series.\n[54] Assessing the impugned cross-redemption capital dividend in the context of the entire series of transactions, as the Tax Court should have done, I fail to see how that transaction was abusive. I agree with 3295 that this series\u2019 overall result is consistent with the object, spirit and purpose of the capital gains regime as previously identified by this Court\u2014that is, to tax real economic gains: Triad Gestco Ltd. v. The Queen, 2012 FCA 258 at paras. 40\u201342.\nB. The Tax Court Failed to Consider the Alternative Transactions [55] By failing to consider the entire series and its overall result, the Tax Court not only misconstrued the abuse analysis but also improperly rejected alternative transactions, which would have confirmed that the series is not abusive.\n[56] Alternative transactions that a taxpayer might have carried out are considered in the course of GAAR analyses.\n[57] For instance, in some cases, the existence of a tax benefit can only be established by comparing the tax consequences of the transaction or series actually carried out with the tax consequences of an alternative transaction that might have been carried out: Canada Trustco at para. 20; Copthorne at para. 35. A perfect example is the case at bar, in which 3295 conceded the existence of a tax benefit because selling its 1.5M Holdings shares without the series would have resulted in a higher capital gain.\n[58] Similarly, courts consider alternative transactions\u2019 tax consequences when determining whether tax avoidance is abusive: Shawn D. Porter, \u201cThe Misuse and Abuse Exception: The Role of Alternative Transactions\u201d in Brian J. Arnold, ed., The General Anti-Avoidance Rule: Past, Present, and Future (Toronto: Canadian Tax Foundation, 2021) at 275\u2013286 [Porter], citing Lehigh Cement Limited v. Canada, 2010 FCA 124 at paras. 40\u201341; Birchcliff at paras. 31, 48; Mathew v. Canada, 2005 SCC 55 at para. 58. Alternative transactions are helpful in determining the object, spirit and purpose of the relevant provisions and, correspondingly, what the Act seeks to allow and prevent. As stated by Webb J.A. of this Court:\nIn my view, these alternative transactions are a relevant factor in determining whether or not there has been an abuse of the provisions of the ITA [Income Tax Act]. If the taxpayer can illustrate that there are other transactions that could have achieved the same result without triggering any tax, then, in my view, this would be a relevant consideration in determining whether or not the avoidance transaction is abusive.\n(\u2026) [T]he alternative means by which the same result could have been realized is a relevant consideration in determining whether or not the avoidance transaction was abusive.\n(Univar Holdco Canada ULC v. Canada, 2017 FCA 207 at paras. 19\u201320 [Univar])\n[59] Here, 3295 asked the Tax Court to consider the four non-abusive alternative transactions, which would have allowed Micsau to use its high ACB in 3295. As mentioned, the Tax Court decided that these alternatives were not valid comparisons because \u201cthey related to the sale of the [3295] shares\u201d and \u201cit was shown that the sale of Holdings\u2019 shares was essential\u201d with the consequence that the \u201cpurpose of the sale, the price and the business implications would have been different\u201d: TCC Reasons at paras. 159\u2013160.\n[60] The Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the sale of the shares in Holdings was essential is inconsistent with the evidence and constitutes a palpable and overriding error: the shares Novartis purchased were not those in Holdings, but those in 4244. Further, nothing in the record suggests that the sale of shares in 4244 affected the purpose of the sale or the business implications of the transaction with Novartis. Indeed, Novartis obtained a $1.5M reduction of the sale price in exchange for its agreement to purchase the 4244 shares instead of the Holdings shares. It is quite possible that the same reduction would have taken place under the alternative transactions submitted by 3295, but those were never put to Novartis.\n[61] More fundamentally, in deciding not to consider the alternative transactions, the Tax Court failed to take into account the series\u2019 overall result: Micsau used its high ACB, and a capital gain was realized, which was roughly equal to the capital gain Micsau would have realized from selling 3295 directly. In my opinion, the alternative transactions 3295 submitted are relevant because:\na)They are available under the Act. The fact that they were not presented to Novartis or that Novartis may have refused to proceed with them does not detract from the fact that the Act allowed for these transactions;\nb)They are not so remote as to be practically infeasible. The alternative transactions 3295 submitted could realistically have been carried out. Had Novartis or RoundTable agreed, carrying out these alternatives would have been relatively easy;\nc)They have a high degree of commercial and economic similarity to the series at issue: Porter at 270. The alternative transactions would have resulted in Novartis acquiring shares of a corporation whose underlying asset would be the generic drug business\u2014exactly what Novartis in fact acquired;\nd)They generate tax consequences approximately as favourable as the series at issue: The proposed alternatives would have enabled Micsau to use its ACB in the 3295 shares. This would have generated a capital gain of $53.7M\u2014roughly the same gain that 3295 realized in our case; and\ne)They are not abusive of the GAAR: Univar at para. 20; Porter at 277\u2013279. The various alternative transactions would have enabled Micsau to realize its high ACB without attracting the application of the GAAR.\n[62] Accordingly, the Tax Court erred in failing to consider the alternative transactions.\nVI. Conclusion [63] I would allow the appeal with costs in this Court and the court below, and set aside the judgment of the Tax Court. Rendering the judgment that the Tax Court should have rendered, I would allow 3295\u2019s appeal from the reassessment dated November 21, 2008, and refer the reassessment back to the Minister for reassessment on the basis that 3295 did not realize an additional capital gain of $31.5M in its 2005 taxation year.\n\"Nathalie Goyette\"\nJ.A.\n\"I agree.\nYves de Montigny C.J.\"\n\"I agree.\nGerald Heckman J.A.\"\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-201-22\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\n3295940 CANADA INC. v.

The appellants asserted in their statement of claim that the levying of such fees violates subsection 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as they only apply to \u201cnon-Canadian born\u201d individuals, and as they discriminate against such individuals on the basis of their national or ethnic origin.\n[2] In a decision reported as 2022 FC 1231, the Federal Court accepted that the appellants\u2019 statement of claim identified two groups of individuals who were required to pay the fees in question, who were thus treated differently than others. It found, however, that the basis for that differential treatment was neither an enumerated nor an analogous ground of discrimination as contemplated by section 15 of the Charter. Consequently, the Federal Court found that it was plain and obvious that a claim asserting discrimination against these groups based on the Charter was bound to fail. Accordingly, the Court struck out the appellants\u2019 statement of claim, without leave to amend.\n[3] The Federal Court also dismissed the appellants\u2019 motion to certify the action as a class proceeding, again on the basis that the statement of claim failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action.\n[4] The appellants submit that in striking their statement of claim and refusing to certify the action as a class proceeding, the Federal Court erred in law in failing to find that it was at least arguable that being \u201cnon-Canadian born\u201d could qualify as a protected ground for the purpose of subsection 15(1) of the Charter. The Court further erred, the appellants say, in denying them leave to amend their statement of claim.\n[5] The appellants also argue that the Federal Court erred in failing to render a decision with respect to the four other criteria that have to be satisfied for a proceeding to be certified as a class action, even though the Court had already found the reasonable cause of action requirement had not been met. According to the appellants, the Court\u2019s failure to address these other criteria was contrary to the principle that the Court should seek to secure the most expeditious and least expensive outcome for every case.\n[6] For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the appellants\u2019 statement of claim does not disclose a reasonable cause of action, and that the Federal Court did not err in denying leave to the appellants to amend their statement of claim. I have further found that the Court did not err in failing to consider the other four criteria for the certification of class actions. Consequently, I would dismiss the appeal.\nI. Background [7] There are two categories of fees at issue in this proceeding. The first is a $500.00 fee prescribed by subsection 303(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR\/2002-227 (IRPA Regulations). This fee is charged to foreign nationals who seek to acquire permanent resident status. The parties refer to this as the \u201cRight of Permanent Residence Fee\u201d [RPRF].\n[8] The second category of fees being challenged is that prescribed by section 32 of the Citizenship Regulations, SOR\/93-246. This is a fee of $100.00 which is to be paid \u201cfor the right to be a citizen\u201d, and is payable by the applicant at the time of making the application for citizenship, but is refunded if citizenship is not granted. The parties describe this as the \u201cRight to be a Citizen Fee\u201d [RCF].\n[9] I shall refer to the RPRF and the RCF collectively in these reasons as \u201cthe Fees\u201d.\n[10] The appellant, Michael Brink, is an immigrant who resides in Canada. On May 10, 2017, while still resident in South Africa, Mr. Brink applied to become a permanent resident of Canada. He paid the RPRF as well as an application fee for the processing of his application, and his application for permanent residence was granted on March 17, 2018. Mr. Brink came to this country in 2019.\n[11] The appellant, Fuh-Chii Yang, was born in Taiwan and came to Canada in 2015. Ms. Yang was a permanent resident of Canada when she applied for Canadian citizenship on July 13, 2019, paying the RCF and an application fee at that time. Ms. Yang became a Canadian citizen in 2021.\nII. The Appellants\u2019 Statement of Claim [12] Paragraph 15 of the statement of claim states that the appellants bring the proposed class action on their own behalf, and on behalf of a putative class described as being comprised of:\nAll individuals who were not born in Canada and between September 8, 2014 until the date of the Court\u2019s trial judgment, have paid, or would otherwise be subject to the following fees:\na. a Right of Permanent Residence Fee; and\/or\nb. a Right to be a Citizen Fee,\nexcluding those who:\nc. have received a refund of the Right of Permanent Residence Fee under subsection 303(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations; or\nd. have received a refund of the Right to be a Citizen Fee under section 33 of the Citizenship Regulations.\n[13] Paragraph 19 of the statement of claim further states that the class is comprised of \u201cindividuals born outside of Canada that are otherwise fully qualified to permanently reside in Canada, or to have the right or privilege of being a Canadian citizen, and are charged taxes that are not charged to individuals born in Canada\u201d.\n[14] While the putative class is identified as being comprised as \u201cindividuals who were not born in Canada\u201d, paragraphs 40 and 42 of the statement of claim state that the distinction created by the Fees is based upon class members\u2019 \u201cnational or ethnic origin, or country of origin\u201d.\n[15] Paragraph 45 of the statement of claim further asserts that \u201csingling out the Class Members under the guise of charging the Taxes [has] further injured their dignity, feelings, and self-respect\u201d.\n[16] The appellants submit that they were subject to fees to which individuals born in Canada are not subject. They contend that these fees are discriminatory and contrary to the constitutional guarantee of substantive equality contained in section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11. Consequently, the appellants submit that they (and other members of the class) are entitled to restitution of what they say are unconstitutional fees.\n[17] The appellants refer to both classes of fees as \u201ctaxes\u201d throughout the statement of claim, stating at paragraph 4 that the Fees are \u201cakin to \u2018head taxes\u2019\u201d. However, counsel for the appellants confirmed at the hearing that nothing turns on the appellants\u2019 use of the term \u201ctaxes\u201d in the claim, and that the term is used interchangeably with the term \u201cfees\u201d in the pleading. In particular, counsel confirmed that the appellants are not pursuing an argument that the Fees are in fact unlawful taxes, such as that advanced in Eurig Estate (Re), [1998] 2 S.C.R. 565, [1998] S.C.J. No. 72.\n[18] That said, the appellants assert that whether the Fees are characterized as a tax or a regulatory charge does not change the fact that they are discriminatory and unconstitutional.\n[19] It should be noted that the appellants do not take issue with the fact that they have to apply for permanent residency or Canadian citizenship, nor do they allege that the application fees that class members are required to pay as part of their applications for permanent residence or citizenship are discriminatory.\n[20] Canada acknowledges that it requires foreign nationals to pay the RPRF in order to acquire permanent resident status and that landed immigrants have to pay the RCF to acquire Canadian citizenship. It asserts, however, that the Fees are required in order to impose a greater share of costs on those who receive a specific benefit, thereby sharing the financial burden more equitably among those who benefit from it.\n[21] Following the resolution of certain preliminary issues, the appellants brought a motion to certify this proceeding as a class action and Canada brought its motion to strike the statement of claim. The Federal Court dealt with both motions in a single decision.\nIII. The Federal Court\u2019s Decision [22] As noted earlier, Canada\u2019s motion was successful, and the Federal Court struck out the appellants\u2019 statement of claim without leave to amend on the basis that it did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. The Court dismissed the appellants\u2019 certification motion for the same reason.\n[23] The Federal Court found that although the appellants\u2019 statement of claim stated that the groups required to pay the Fees in order to obtain permanent resident status and Canadian citizenship are treated differently than others, that distinction is not based on a prohibited ground of discrimination. As a result, the Court held that the appellants had failed to establish that their statement of claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action.\n[24] Citing this Court\u2019s decision in Wenham v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 199 at para. 29, the Federal Court recognized that its task was not to assess the odds of a cause of action ultimately succeeding. The test was, rather, \u201cwhether a cause of action has been pleaded that is not plain and obvious to fail\u201d: Wenham, above at para. 31. The appellants do not take issue with the test identified by the Federal Court, but rather with its application in this case.\n[25] The Federal Court noted that the appellants claimed that there is a distinction in the treatment accorded to those born in Canada and those born outside Canada. The question for determination was whether this equated to discrimination based on an enumerated or analogous ground for the purposes of section 15 of the Charter.\n[26] While the appellants\u2019 statement of claim alleged discrimination based on \u201cnational or ethnic origin, or country of origin\u201d, the Federal Court observed that the alleged bases for the discrimination had expanded over time. In addition to the aforementioned grounds, the appellants\u2019 memorandum of fact and law filed in support of their certification motion also asserted that the Fees create a distinction based on the analogous ground of citizenship.\n[27] The Federal Court noted that the alleged grounds of discrimination had further evolved in the appellants\u2019 oral submissions to the Court, with counsel asserting that the bases for the alleged discrimination between the two groups were the enumerated grounds of national origin or ethnic origin, and analogous grounds that included citizenship, birth, or place of birth.\n[28] The Federal Court observed that a Charter claim could only succeed if the distinction in issue was based on a proscribed ground of discrimination, whether it be an enumerated or an analogous ground. If it was not based on at least one such ground, then it was plain and obvious that the action could not succeed. The Court thus considered each of the alleged bases of distinction alleged by the appellants, and whether the distinction with respect to the Fees was based on that ground.\n[29] Dealing first with the question of \u201cnational origin\u201d, the Federal Court held that \u201cnational origin\u201d refers to the nation where a person was born, or more broadly, where that person\u2019s ancestors came from. The Court held that the distinction between the two groups\u2014those who must pay the Fees and those who are not required to pay the Fees\u2014was not based on individuals\u2019 national origin, as \u201cthere are persons in each group with a variety of national origins, and some with the same national origin\u201d.\n[30] The Court further observed that while most people born in Canada are automatically Canadian citizens, there are exceptions to this such as, for example, children born in Canada to diplomatic or consular officers of a foreign government. Such individuals would have a Canadian \u201cnational origin\u201d as they were born here, but they would nevertheless be required to pay the Fees. Similarly, children born outside Canada to parents, at least one of whom is a Canadian citizen, are automatically Canadian citizens. The \u201cnational origin\u201d of such individuals would be that of a country other than Canada, but they would not be required to pay the Fees.\n[31] From this, the Federal Court concluded that the distinction in issue in this case was not based on the class members\u2019 national origin.\n[32] The Federal Court next considered whether it was plain and obvious that the discrimination claim based on \u201cethnic origin\u201d was bound to fail. The Court noted that \u201cethnic origin\u201d refers to the ethnic or cultural origins of a person and\/or the person\u2019s ancestors, and that the ethnic origin of those born in Canada encompasses most or all of the world\u2019s cultural or ethnic origins. As such, the Court found that there was no arguable case that the distinction at issue in this case was based on the class members\u2019 ethnic origins. Indeed, the ethnic origin of those born in Canada who were not required to pay the Fees parallels the ethnic origins of those not born in Canada who may be required to pay the Fees.\n[33] Although not specifically referred to as an alleged ground of discrimination in the statement of claim, the Federal Court also considered whether \u201ccitizenship\u201d was the basis of the distinction at issue in this case. The Court observed that while it was true that Canadian citizens are not required to pay either type of fee, it was also true that not all non-Canadian citizens seeking either permanent residence or citizenship were required to pay the Fees.\n[34] Indeed, the Court observed that the IRPA Regulations exempt various categories of individuals from the RPRF, many of whom are persons born outside Canada. Such individuals include, for example, dependent children of principal applicants for permanent resident status. The Citizenship Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29, similarly exempts certain classes of non-citizen individuals from the RCF, including, for example, minor adoptees.\n[35] From this, the Federal Court concluded that the basis of the distinction between those required to pay the Fees and those who are not is not their citizenship.\n[36] Insofar as class members\u2019 \u201cplace of birth\u201d was concerned, the Federal Court found that it was plain and obvious that the claim based on place of birth could not succeed for the same reason that the claim based on national origin was bound to fail. That is, individuals subject to the Fees could have been born anywhere. Consequently, the distinction in question is not based on individuals\u2019 places of birth.\n[37] The Federal Court thus accepted that the appellants had identified two groups of individuals who were required to pay the Fees who were distinguished from another group of persons not required to pay the Fees. However, the basis for that distinction was neither an enumerated nor an analogous ground of discrimination for the purposes of section 15 of the Charter. Consequently, the Court found that it was plain and obvious that the appellants\u2019 discrimination claim was bound to fail, and it granted the Crown\u2019s motion to strike without leave to amend. The Court dismissed the appellants\u2019 motion to certify the action as a class proceeding for the same reason.\nIV. Issues [38] The primary issue raised by the appellants is whether the Federal Court erred in law in failing to find that it was at least arguable that being \u201cnon-Canadian born\u201d could qualify as an analogous protected ground for the purposes of section 15 of the Charter. The appellants further argue that the Federal Court erred in denying them leave to amend their statement of claim.\n[39] The other issue raised by the appellants is whether, having found that their statement of claim did not disclose a reasonable cause of action, the Federal Court erred in failing to render a decision with respect to the four remaining certification criteria.\nV. Standard of Review [40] Whether a pleading discloses a cause of action is primarily a question of law. The standard of appellate review of the Federal Court\u2019s decision on both the motion to strike and the first certification condition is thus that of correctness: Canada (Attorney General) v. Nasogaluak, 2023 FCA 61 at para. 21; Pioneer Corp. v. Godfrey, 2019 SCC 42 at para. 57; Canada (Attorney General) v. Jost, 2020 FCA 212 at para. 21. On this standard, this Court owes no deference to the Federal Court: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 at para. 8.\n[41] The decision whether or not to grant leave to a party to amend their statement of claim is a discretionary one. So too is the decision whether or not to address other issues raised by a case, once a determinative issue has been decided. The standard of review applicable to discretionary decisions of the Federal Court is the Housen v. Nikolaisen standard. That is, correctness for questions of law and palpable and overriding error for questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law (except where there is an extricable question of law): Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, 2016 FCA 215 at para. 79; Canada v. Preston, 2023 FCA 178 at para. 12; Michaels of Canada, ULC v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 243 at para. 2; Newbould v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FCA 106 at para. 19.\nVI. Principles Governing Motions to Strike [42] As noted earlier, the parties agree that the Federal Court properly identified the principles governing motions brought pursuant to Rule 221(1)(a) of the Federal Court Rules, SOR\/98-106 to strike statements of claim on the basis that they do not disclose a reasonable cause of action.\n[43] That is, a statement of claim should not be struck unless it is plain and obvious that the action cannot succeed, assuming the facts pleaded in the statement of claim to be true: Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959, [1990] S.C.J. No. 93 at 980; Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd. v. Microsoft Corporation, 2013 SCC 57 at para. 63. In other words, the claim must have no reasonable prospect of success: R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42 at para. 17.\n[44] The onus is on the party who seeks to establish that a pleading fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action: La Rose v. Canada, 2023 FCA 241 at para. 19; Edell v. Canada, 2010 FCA 26 at para. 5. The threshold that a plaintiff must meet to establish that a claim discloses a reasonable cause of action is a low one: Brake v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 274 at para. 70.\n[45] Pleadings must, moreover, be read generously, in a manner that accommodates any inadequacies in the allegations that are merely the result of deficiencies in the drafting of the document: see Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441, [1985] S.C.J. No. 22 at 451.\n[46] Motions judges should not delve into the merits of a plaintiff\u2019s argument, but should, rather, consider whether the plaintiff should be precluded from advancing the argument at all: Salna v. Voltage Pictures, LLC, 2021 FCA 176 at para. 77. Recognizing that the law is not static, motions judges must also err on the side of permitting novel, but arguable claims to proceed to trial: R. v. Imperial Tobacco, above at paras. 19-25; Mohr v. National Hockey League, 2022 FCA 145 at para. 48, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 40426 (20 April 2023).\n[47] That said, it must also be recognized that there is a cost to access to justice in allowing cases that have no substance to proceed. The diversion of scarce judicial resources to such cases diverts time away from potentially meritorious cases that require attention: Mohr, above at para. 50; Coote v. Lawyers\u2019 Professional Indemnity Company, 2013 FCA 143 at para. 13.\n[48] Insofar as the appellants\u2019 certification motion is concerned, Rule 334.16(1) of the Federal Courts Rules identifies five conditions that must be satisfied for a proceeding in the Federal Court to be certified as a class proceeding. The first of these requires that the pleadings disclose a reasonable cause of action. This condition is assessed on the same standard that applies on a motion to strike out a pleading: Pro-Sys, above at para. 63; Salna, above at para. 72; Atlantic Lottery Corp. Inc. v. Babstock, 2020 SCC 19 at para. 14; Nasogaluak, above at para. 18.\n[49] To fail at this stage of the test the claim must be \u201cbereft of any possibility of success\u201d: Wenham, above at para. 33, citing Canada (National Revenue) v. JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc., 2013 FCA 250 at para. 47.\n[50] As is the case with motions to strike, there is a heavy burden on a defendant trying to defeat a certification motion on the ground that the statement of claim fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action. Indeed, the burden resting on a defendant in such cases has been described by this Court as \u201conerous\u201d: Nasogaluak, above at para. 19; Canada v. Greenwood, 2021 FCA 186 at para. 144, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 39885 (17 March 2022).\nVII. Principles of Pleading [51] Before considering whether the appellants\u2019 statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action, it is important to first have regard to the requirements of pleading.\n[52] Rule 174 of the Federal Courts Rules provides that \u201c[e]very pleading shall contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the party relies...\u201d. Rule 181(1) further requires that pleadings \u201ccontain particulars of every allegation contained therein \u2026\u201d.\n[53] As this Court observed in Mancuso v. Canada (National Health and Welfare), 2015 FCA 227, \u201c[i]t is fundamental to the trial process that plaintiffs plead material facts in sufficient detail to support the claim and relief sought\u201d. This is because pleadings play an important role in providing notice, and in defining the issues to be tried: at para. 16.\n[54] Not only is the proper pleading of a statement of claim necessary for a defendant to prepare a statement of defence, the material facts will also establish the parameters of relevancy of evidence at discovery and trial: Mancuso, above at para. 17. In addition, the nature of the facts pleaded allows counsel to advise their clients, prepare their case and map a trial strategy. The Court and the opposing parties should thus not be left to speculate as to how the facts might be arranged to support various causes of action.\n[55] A statement of claim must plead each constituent element of every cause of action with sufficient particularity, and each allegation must be supported by material facts. The bald assertion of conclusions does not constitute the pleading of material facts: Mancuso, above at para. 27; Canadian Olympic Association v. USA Hockey, Inc. (1997), 74 C.P.R. (3d) 348, 72 A.C.W.S. (3d) 346 (F.C.T.D.). Indeed, if the Court were to \u201c[allow] parties to plead bald allegations of fact or mere conclusory statements of law, the pleadings would fail to perform their role in identifying the issues\u201d: Mancuso, above at para. 17.\n[56] What will constitute a material fact in a statement of claim in a given case is to be determined in light of the causes of action asserted and the damages sought. Plaintiffs must plead\u2014in summary form but with sufficient detail\u2014the constituent elements of each cause of action or legal ground raised. The pleading must tell the defendant the \u201cwho, when, where, how and what\u201d of the actions that allegedly give rise to its liability: Mancuso, above at para. 19.\n[57] An assessment of the sufficiency of the material facts pleaded in a statement of claim is contextual and fact-driven. There is no bright line between material facts and bald allegations, nor is there a bright line between the pleading of material facts and the prohibition on the pleading of evidence. They are, rather, points on a continuum. It is the responsibility of a motions judge, \u201clooking at the pleadings as a whole, to ensure that the pleadings define the issues with sufficient precision to make the pre-trial and trial proceedings both manageable and fair\u201d: Mancuso, above at para. 18.\n[58] Plaintiffs can neither file inadequate pleadings and rely on defendants to request particulars, nor supplement insufficient pleadings to make them sufficient through particulars: Mancuso, above at para. 20; AstraZeneca Canada Inc. v. Novopharm Limited, 2010 FCA 112.\n[59] This Court has confirmed that there are no separate rules of pleadings for Charter cases, and that the requirement of material facts applies to pleadings of Charter infringement in the same way that it does with respect to causes of action rooted in the common law. The substantive content of each Charter right\u2014including claims under section 15 of the Charter\u2014has been clearly defined by decisions of the Supreme Court, and plaintiffs must plead sufficient material facts to satisfy the criteria applicable to the provision in question. This is not a technicality, but is rather essential to the proper presentation of Charter issues: Mancuso, above at paras. 21, 25; MacKay v. Manitoba, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357, [1989] S.C.J. No. 88 at 361-367.\n[60] The normal rules of pleading similarly apply with equal force to proposed class proceedings. Indeed, the launching of a proposed class action is a serious matter, as it potentially affects the rights of many class members as well as the interests of defendants. Compliance with the requirements of the Rules is consequently not a trifling or optional matter; it is both mandatory and essential: Merchant Law Group v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2010 FCA 184 at para. 40.\n[61] With this understanding of the requirements for pleading a claim such as this, I turn next to consider the appellants\u2019 arguments as to the errors allegedly committed by the Federal Court in determining that their statement of claim should be struck for failing to disclose a reasonable cause of action.\nVIII. The Appellants\u2019 Section 15 Arguments [62] Subsection 15(1) of the Charter states that \u201c[e]very individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability\u201d.\n[63] The protections afforded by section 15 of the Charter are not limited to the grounds expressly referred to in the provision itself (the \u201cenumerated grounds\u201d). They also extend to certain grounds not specifically mentioned in the section, known as the \u201canalogous grounds\u201d. Analogous grounds are often the bases for stereotypical decisions made not on the basis of merit, but on the basis of personal characteristics that are immutable or constructively immutable, being changeable only at unacceptable cost to personal identity: Corbiere v. Canada (Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 203, 173 D.L.R. (4th) 1 at para.13.\n[64] To establish a violation of subsection 15(1) of the Charter, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the impugned law or state action:\ncreates a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds, on its face or in its impact, and\nimposes a burden or denies a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage: R. v. Sharma, 2022 SCC 39 at para. 28; Fraser v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 SCC 28 at para. 27.\n[65] A claimant must first establish that the differential treatment to which he or she claims to have been subjected is based on either an enumerated or an analogous ground within the scope of section 15.\n[66] In addition to being victims of discrimination based on their national or ethnic origins, the appellants contend that class members are subject to discrimination based on their \u201cplaces of birth\u201d and the fact that they were born outside of Canada. They further submit that class members form the type of discrete and insular minority that warrants protection under section 15 of the Charter.\n[67] The first question for consideration is thus whether the appellants\u2019 section 15 claim as pleaded in their statement of claim is based on an enumerated or analogous ground.\nA. Is the Appellants\u2019 Section 15 Claim Based on an Enumerated or Analogous Ground? [68] I agree with Canada that the alleged grounds of discrimination in this case have been something of a moving target. The appellants assert that the differential treatment allegedly at issue in this case was based on the fact that members of the putative class were \u201cnon-Canadian born\u201d. This, the appellants say, resulted in discrimination based on class members\u2019 national origin, ethnic origin, and\/or their country of origin.\n[69] As noted earlier, \u201ccitizenship\u201d was not alleged as a basis for the differential treatment in the statement of claim, but was raised as a ground of discrimination in the memorandum of fact and law filed by the appellants in support of their certification motion. The proscribed grounds of discrimination alleged by the appellants further evolved in their oral argument before the Federal Court, when they alleged that the distinction in issue was based on class members\u2019 \u201cplace of birth\u201d or simply their \u201cbirth\u201d.\n[70] That said, the appellants have acknowledged that their \u201cprimary complaint of discrimination\u201d relates to the place of birth of class members being outside of Canada.\n[71] I will consider citizenship as a possible arguable ground for the appellants\u2019 section 15 claim later in these reasons. In the meantime, I will confine my analysis to the grounds of alleged discrimination that were specifically identified in the appellants\u2019 statement of claim, namely discrimination based on class members\u2019 national origin, ethnic origin, and\/or their country of origin, including their country of birth.\n[72] In assessing whether a statement of claim should be struck, the Court must look at the claim as it has been drafted, not how it might be drafted: Merchant Law Group, above at para. 40.\n[73] The appellants argue that the Federal Court erred in striking their statement of claim by failing to find that it was at least arguable that their claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action based on their places of birth. In support of this contention, they cite the decisions of the Federal Court and this Court in Veffer v. Canada (Minister of Foreign Affairs), 2006 FC 540 (Veffer FC), aff\u2019d 2007 FCA 247 (Veffer FCA), leave to appeal to SCC refused, 32260 (14 February 2008). These decisions held that an individual\u2019s place of birth is immutable, and that it thus qualifies as an analogous ground for the purpose of section 15 of the Charter.\n[74] The appellants further observe that once recognized, an analogous ground always stands as a constant marker of potential legislative discrimination: Corbiere, above at para. 10; Fraser, above at para. 183. Consequently, the appellants say that the Federal Court erred in failing to find that they had an arguable case based upon class members\u2019 places of birth.\n[75] The appellants note that the threshold that they had to meet to establish that their statement of claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action was a low one, submitting that it was not \u201cplain and obvious\u201d that an individual being non-Canadian born could not be protected from discrimination under section 15 of the Charter. According to the appellants, the Veffer decisions are \u201ca complete answer\u201d to the first step of the two-part section 15 analysis, and their statement of claim thus raises an arguable case that the imposition of the Fees draws a distinction between class members and others based on the analogous ground of \u201cplace of birth\u201d.\n[76] The appellants further assert that they brought the Veffer decisions to the attention of the Federal Court in their written submissions, but that the Court failed to address them in its decision.\n[77] The facts of Veffer are instructive. Mr. Veffer is a Canadian citizen who was born in Jerusalem. He applied for a Canadian passport, indicating in his application form that his place of birth was \u201cJerusalem, Israel\u201d, asking that it be recorded as such in his passport. The Government of Canada denied his request based on a policy that required that the place of birth designation for individuals born in Jerusalem be indicated simply as \u201cJerusalem\u201d in their Canadian passports, and not \u201cJerusalem, Israel\u201d.\n[78] Mr. Veffer sought judicial review of this decision, alleging that the Government\u2019s policy regarding place of birth descriptions in passports violated his right to freedom of religion under subsection 2(a) of the Charter and his section 15 equality rights, based on his religion and his place of birth.\n[79] The Federal Court held that the Government\u2019s passport policy drew a formal distinction between Mr. Veffer and others, based on his place of birth. The Court further found that Canadian passport applicants born in Jerusalem were treated differently from other passport applicants born outside Canada: Veffer FC, above at para. 34. The Federal Court went on, however, to determine that such a distinction was not discriminatory.\n[80] In Veffer FCA, the parties agreed that \u201cplace of birth\u201d was a ground analogous to those enumerated in subsection 15(1) of the Charter, as it met the criteria laid out in Corbiere, namely that it was an innate, immutable characteristic that was not alterable by conscious action: Veffer FCA, above at para. 56. This Court nevertheless dismissed Mr. Veffer\u2019s appeal. In so doing, this Court observed that not every distinction created by legislation will be discriminatory, and that a reasonable person would not conclude that the passport policy invaded Mr. Veffer\u2019s human dignity: at paras. 58, 72.\n[81] The appellants here argue that to establish that their statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action all they need is an opening to advance a novel claim. They say that this Court\u2019s decision in Veffer provides that opening, and that accordingly this case should be allowed to go to trial.\n[82] It is important to recognize, however, that the alleged discrimination at issue in Veffer was based upon the claimant having a particular place of birth\u2014that is, his having been born in the city of Jerusalem. Both Courts accepted that Mr. Veffer (and others born in Jerusalem) were treated differently than other passport applicants, because of the particular place where they were born.\n[83] That is not the situation here. Members of the putative class are not a discrete and insular minority, as was the case in Veffer. Indeed, they are a diffuse and disparate group. Class members are not subject to the Fees because they were born in a specific country, as the Fees apply regardless of class members\u2019 country of origin and the legislation imposing the Fees draws no distinction with respect to applicants\u2019 places of birth. Class members are subject to the Fees because they seek permanent residency in Canada or Canadian citizenship, regardless of where they were born.\n[84] The appellants contend that they do not need to show that every class member is potentially subject to the Fees, as the Supreme Court has held that \u201cpartial discrimination\u201d is no less discriminatory than discrimination occurring in situations in which all members of a protected group are affected: Fraser, above at para. 72. That said, it bears noting that, as the Federal Court observed in this case, some individuals may be subject to the Fees, even though they were born in Canada.\n[85] The distinction between having a particular place of birth and being born outside Canada writ large illustrates the flaw in the appellants\u2019 \u201chead tax\u201d analogy.\n[86] As noted earlier, the appellants characterize the Fees as being \u201cakin to \u2018head taxes\u2019\u201d in their statement of claim. In so doing, they attempt to draw an analogy between the Fees at issue in this case and the shameful practice in Canada\u2019s past where migrants from China (and no other country) were required to pay a monetary amount in order to come to Canada. This was known as a \u201chead tax\u201d.\n[87] What was particularly offensive about the head tax was the singling out of would-be immigrants from one country. Not only was the policy racist in origin, it perpetuated negative stereotyping of Chinese individuals and clearly communicated to them (and others) that they were less worthy of being admitted to Canada and less welcome in this country than would-be immigrants from other countries.\n[88] A more apt analogy to a head tax could arise if RPRF and RCF fees were only charged to people born in Germany or Somalia or Vietnam who were seeking permanent residence in Canada or Canadian citizenship: Canadian Doctors for Refugee Care v. Canada (Attorney General), 2014 FC 651 at para. 765.\n[89] That is not, however, what we are dealing with here. The Fees are payable by anyone\u2014whatever their national origin, ethnic origin or place of birth\u2014who seeks permanent residence in Canada or Canadian citizenship. Veffer is thus distinguishable from the present case, and this Court\u2019s comments in Veffer FCA with respect to \u201cplace of birth\u201d being an analogous ground have to be read in this context.\n[90] This distinction was recognized by this Court in Pawar v. Canada (1999), 247 N.R. 271, [1999] F.C.J. No. 1421 (F.C.A.). Pawar involved a section 15 Charter challenge to the residency requirement of the Old Age Security Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. O-9 brought by individuals who were born abroad. In upholding the Federal Court\u2019s decision dismissing the action by way of summary judgment, this Court held that \u201cbeing born abroad\u201d was not embraced by the concept of \u201cnational and ethnic origin\u201d, and that it was neither an enumerated nor an analogous ground under section 15 of the Charter: at para. 2.\n[91] This Court observed that the distinction at issue in Pawar was based on class members\u2019 prior residency in countries without reciprocal pension agreements with Canada, and that it had nothing to do with the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cnational or ethnic origin\u201d. In other words, the distinction at issue in Pawar was not based on the particular country where class members had previously resided, but rather on whether those countries had entered into reciprocal pension agreements with Canada: para. 2.\n[92] More importantly for our purposes, this Court further held in Pawar that \u201cpeople born abroad\u201d \u201cdo not form a discrete and insular group who have suffered historical disadvantage because of immutable personal characteristics or vulnerability to political and social prejudice\u201d: at para. 3.\n[93] The appellants point to the brevity of this Court\u2019s reasons in Pawar, suggesting that the decision may not have been fully considered, and that this should limit the decision\u2019s persuasive effect. While it is true that the decision is only five paragraphs in length, this Court started its reasons by acknowledging the \u201cgreat significance of the case\u201d: at para. 1. The Court went on to state that it had arrived at its decision only \u201c[a]fter having long considered and studied the written representations of counsel and listened carefully to their oral arguments\u201d: at para. 2. The panel thus clearly understood the importance of the case, and considered it carefully.\n[94] Perhaps more importantly, the decision of the Federal Court under consideration was substantial, detailed and carefully considered: Pawar v. Canada, [1998] F.C.J. 1418, [1999] 1 F.C. 158. This Court agreed with that decision, finding it unnecessary to repeat the Federal Court\u2019s analysis: at para. 4. That does not mean that this Court did not carefully consider the case. It also bears noting that the Supreme Court of Canada subsequently denied leave to the class members in Pawar to appeal this Court\u2019s decision: [1999] S.C.C.A. No. 526, 27578 (8 June 2000).\n[95] A differently constituted panel of this Court subsequently came to the same conclusion as the Court did in Pawar: Shergill v. Canada, 2003 FCA 468, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 30177 (13 May 2004).\n[96] In accordance with doctrine of vertical stare decisis, this Court\u2019s decision in Pawar was binding on the Federal Court. Even though the Federal Court did not mention Pawar in its analysis, the Court was nevertheless bound to find that that \u201cbeing born abroad\u201d was not an analogous ground for the purpose of section 15 of the Charter, nor was it subsumed within the enumerated grounds of national or ethnic origin. As a result, it was plain and obvious that the appellants\u2019 claim could not succeed.\n[97] Stare decisis also has a horizontal aspect, which provides that decisions from the same court should be followed unless there is a compelling reason not to do so: R. v. Sullivan, 2022 SCC 19 at paras. 74-79; Janssen Inc. v. Canada (Minister of Health), 2021 FCA 137 at para. 72.\n[98] Indeed, as this Court observed in Miller v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 FCA 370, while it is open to this Court to overrule its prior decisions, \u201cthe values of certainty and consistency lie close to the heart of the orderly administration of justice in a system of law and government based on the rule of law\u201d: at para. 8. As a result, one panel of this Court ought not to come to a different conclusion from a different panel, even if it were the view that the first decision was wrongly decided: Miller, above at para. 8.\n[99] The appellants have not provided a compelling reason that would justify departing from this Court\u2019s decision in Pawar. This Court is thus required to conclude that individuals\u2019 place of birth outside of Canada is not embraced by the concept of \u201cnational and ethnic origin\u201d, and that \u201cbeing born abroad\u201d is not an analogous ground under section 15 of the Charter.\n[100] As noted above, class members are subject to the Fees because they are seeking permanent residency in Canada or Canadian citizenship. Their need to do so is a function of their immigration status rather than their place of birth or their national or ethnic origin. This does not assist the appellants, however, as this Court has rejected \u201cimmigration status\u201d as an analogous ground on the basis that it is not a personal characteristic that is immutable or changeable only at great personal cost: Almadhoun v. Canada, 2018 FCA 112 at para. 28. See also Forrest v. Canada (Attorney General), 2006 FCA 400 at para. 16; Toussaint v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FCA 213 at para. 99.\n[101] As noted earlier, the first part of the two-part test for assessing section 15 claims requires claimants to demonstrate that the impugned law or state action creates a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds, on its face or in its impact. As explained above, none of the grounds currently identified in the appellants\u2019 statement of claim constitute enumerated or analogous grounds in the circumstances of their claim.\n[102] It is thus plain and obvious that, to the extent that the appellants\u2019 claim is based on their places of birth being outside of Canada, their national or ethnic origin or their country of origin, it could not succeed, as it did not engage any of the enumerated or analogous grounds protected by subsection 15(1) of the Charter. The Federal Court thus did not err in striking the appellants\u2019 statement of claim on that basis.\n[103] This argument was the primary focus of the appellants\u2019 appeal. To the extent that the appellants raised other issues regarding the viability of their section 15 claim, these arguments will be addressed in the next section of these reasons.\nB. Other Arguments Advanced by the Appellants [104] Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Fraser, above at paragraphs 117 and 120, the appellants contend that an evidentiary record may be required in order for a court to recognize a new analogous ground. Consequently, the appellants say that the Federal Court erred in striking their claim at this stage of the proceeding, thereby denying them the opportunity to lead the necessary evidence to establish that the discrimination at issue in this case was based on an analogous ground.\n[105] It is important to note that the basis for the alleged discrimination at issue in Fraser was family\/parental status, and the Court was being asked to recognize such status as a new analogous ground for the purposes of section 15 of the Charter: at para. 116. While \u201cfamily status\u201d is a protected ground in the federal and most provincial human rights statutes, the Supreme Court had not previously considered whether family\/parental status constituted an analogous ground in the Charter context. As a result, the Court was understandably concerned about recognizing a new analogous ground, in the absence of evidence as to the possible impact that such recognition could have: Fraser, above at para. 120. That is not what we are faced with here.\n[106] As the appellants acknowledge at paragraph 29 of their memorandum of fact and law, whether an alleged ground of discrimination is an enumerated or analogous ground is a legal question. Unlike the situation that the Supreme Court faced in Fraser, the asserted grounds of discrimination at issue in this case have all been judicially considered in the Charter context, including the allegedly analogous grounds of \u201cplace of birth\u201d or \u201cbeing born outside of Canada\u201d.\n[107] The appellants also cite the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Sharma, above, where the Court stated that indirect discrimination may require evidence to be adduced at trial, evidence that could not be made available to the Federal Court on a motion to strike: at paras. 42-44, 49. Assuming for the sake of argument that the alleged discrimination at issue in this case is indeed indirect discrimination (something about which I express no opinion), evidence would undoubtedly be required to demonstrate that the impugned actions actually have a differential impact on a protected group.\n[108] However, whether the affected individuals are in fact members of a protected group such that section 15 of the Charter is engaged on the facts, as pleaded, is a legal question.\n[109] As a consequence, I do not accept the appellants\u2019 contention that they should be given the opportunity to lead evidence at trial to demonstrate that their statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action based on section 15 of the Charter.\n[110] I would also observe that Rule 221(2) of the Federal Courts Rules specifically precludes the use of evidence on a motion to strike a pleading under Rule 221(1)(a) for failing to disclose a reasonable cause of action. This is because the defect in the pleading must be apparent on its face. In this case, it is clear from the jurisprudence discussed above that, as currently pleaded, it is plain and obvious that the appellants\u2019 claim is bereft of any chance of success.\n[111] There are other defects in the appellants\u2019 statement of claim.\n[112] The appellants did not plead sufficient material facts to satisfy the second part of the section 15 Charter test. That is, the requirement that the Fees impose a burden on class members in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating a disadvantage. The appellants also failed to plead sufficient material facts capable of demonstrating that the Fees limited their access to permanent residence or citizenship in a discriminatory manner. Their statement of claim contains a set of conclusions, but does not provide any material facts supporting those conclusions.\n[113] The appellants have also not alleged that the Fees target individuals born abroad in an exclusionary way, or in a way that deprives them of their self-worth or livelihood, or that any proposed class members were impacted in this way. They baldly assert that class members are singled out by the Fees and that their \u201cdignity, feelings and self-respect are injured\u201d, but they provide no material facts in this regard, nor have they alleged that the Fees perpetuate a view that those who have to pay them have less value as members of society.\n[114] It is, therefore, plain and obvious that, as pleaded, the appellants\u2019 claim would also be bound to fail at the second stage of the section 15 analysis.\n[115] Finally, after the hearing of this appeal, the parties drew the Court\u2019s attention to the recent decision of the Ontario Superior Court in Bjorkquist et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, 2023 ONSC 7152.\n[116] The appellants say that Bjorkquist is relevant to this appeal in that it recognizes that being born outside of Canada (regardless of the country) is covered by the enumerated ground of \u201cnational origin\u201d under section 15 of the Charter. The Court further found that the enumerated ground of \u201cnational origin\u201d includes \u201ccountry of birth\u201d, and that the plain reading of section 15 would cover not only birth in a particular country but also \u201cwhether one was born in Canada or in a different country\u201d: at para. 77.\n[117] The Crown observes that Bjorkquist does not address either the sufficiency of pleadings issue or the requirement to plead material facts, in particular. The Crown further submits that the case may or may not be relevant to this appeal, and that, in any event, the decision is both distinguishable and incorrect. I agree.\n[118] Bjorkquist involved a challenge to paragraph 3(3)(a) of the Citizenship Act, which provides that Canadian citizens born abroad are precluded from passing their Canadian citizenship on to their children automatically, if those children were also born abroad. This was known as the \u201csecond-generation cut-off\u201d. Canadians born outside Canada who obtain their citizenship by descent from their Canadian-born parents are treated differently in this regard than Canadians born in Canada and naturalized Canadians, who are entitled to pass their citizenship on to their children, regardless of where those children may be born.\n[119] Amongst other things, the applicants argued that the second-generation cut-off violated section 15 of the Charter, based on their national origin.\n[120] In Bjorkquist, the Court relied on my decision in Canadian Doctors for Refugee Care, above, where I held that the term \u201cnational origin\u201d is broad enough to include people who are born in a particular country, as well as people who come from a particular country: at para. 767. The Court went on in Bjorkquist to find that if discrimination based on country of birth is protected under section 15 of the Charter, it must also protect against discrimination based on whether one was born in Canada or in a different country: at para. 77.\n[121] The Court thus found that the distinction at issue in Bjorkquist was based on the national origin of the claimants, in that it treats those individuals who became Canadians at birth because they were born in Canada differently from those Canadians who obtained their citizenship by descent upon their birth outside of Canada. This latter group holds a lesser class of citizenship because, unlike Canadian-born citizens, they are unable to pass on Canadian citizenship by descent to their children born abroad: Bjorkquist, above at para. 85.\n[122] It is, however, important to understand the context in which my comments in Canadian Doctors were made. At issue in that case was governmental action that reduced the level of healthcare insurance coverage available to refugees and others claiming the protection of Canada, if those individuals came from certain specified countries known as \u201cdesignated countries of origin\u201d. Such individuals received fewer healthcare benefits than refugees and others from non-designated countries of origin.\n[123] In concluding that the government\u2019s actions violated section 15 of the Charter, I found that limiting the healthcare insurance coverage available to such individuals denied them the equal benefit of the law, and conveyed the message that these individuals\u2019 lives were less worthy and that they were less welcome in Canada.\n[124] This is consistent with my earlier comments in this case with respect to the discriminatory nature of the \u201chead tax\u201d that singled out individuals from one country for adverse differential treatment. It is also consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in Veffer FCA, where individuals born in one place\u2014the city of Jerusalem\u2014were treated differently than other applicants for Canadian passports whose passports would signify their country of their birth.\n[125] However, unlike the situation in Bjorkquist, where the differential treatment applied only to individuals born outside Canada, the Fees at issue in this case are payable by anyone\u2014wherever they were born (including in Canada)\u2014who applies for permanent residency or Canadian citizenship. The legislation does not differentiate between applicants born in Canada and those born outside of Canada, and the appellants have not argued that the law has a differential impact on applicants born outside Canada relative to those who were born in this country.\n[126] The facts in Bjorkquist are thus distinguishable from those of the present case. Moreover, to the extent that the Superior Court\u2019s ruling in Bjorkquist is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s holding in Pawar that \u201cbeing born abroad\u201d is not an analogous ground for the purposes of section 15 of the Charter, Pawar governs this case.\n[127] The final issue for determination with respect to this ground of appeal is whether the Federal Court erred in refusing to grant leave to the appellants to amend their statement of claim. This question will be considered next.\nIX. Did the Federal Court Err in Refusing to Grant Leave to Amend the Statement of Claim? [128] As noted earlier, having rejected all of the alleged grounds of discrimination raised by the appellants in their statement of claim and in their written or oral arguments, the Federal Court struck out their statement of claim, without leave to amend. In so doing, the Federal Court did not distinguish between the grounds of discrimination that were specifically pleaded in the appellants\u2019 statement of claim and those that were merely the subject of argument, in particular, that of \u201ccitizenship\u201d.\n[129] Insofar as the alleged discrimination based on citizenship was concerned, the Federal Court observed that while Canadian citizens are not required to pay either type of fee, there are applicants for permanent residence who are not Canadian citizens who also do not have to pay the RPRF. These include individuals born outside Canada such as dependent children and a range of family members of persons sponsoring permanent resident applications. There are also several categories of individuals who are exempt from paying the RCF, including minors applying as adults, minors being granted citizenship and minor adoptees.\n[130] From this, the Federal Court concluded that the basis of the distinction between those required to pay the Fees and those who are not required to do so is not citizenship.\n[131] The appellants submit that they have an arguable case that the Fees discriminate against class members based upon their citizenship. Consequently, the appellants say that if this Court were to decide that the claim, as currently drafted, does not disclose a reasonable cause of action, the Court should nevertheless grant them leave to amend their claim to plead discrimination based on citizenship, and to remedy any deficiencies that the Court may otherwise identify in their statement of claim.\n[132] The decision as to whether or not a party should be granted leave to amend their pleading is a discretionary one. As noted earlier, the standard of review applicable to discretionary orders of the Federal Court is the Housen v. Nikolaisen standard.\n[133] Leave to amend a statement of claim in a proposed class proceeding should only be denied in the clearest cases. That is, where it is plain and obvious that no tenable cause of action is possible on the facts as alleged, and there is no reason to suppose that the party could improve his or her case by an amendment: Jost, above at para. 49.\n[134] It is true that citizenship has been recognized as an analogous ground for the purpose of section 15 of the Charter on the basis that it is, at least temporarily, a personal characteristic that is not alterable by conscious action, and in some cases is not alterable except on the basis of unacceptable cost: Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143, [1989] S.C.J. No. 6 at 151, 158; Lavoie v. Canada, 2002 SCC 23 at paras. 2, 39. However, as was noted earlier, class members are subject to the Fees because they are individuals who are actively seeking to change their legal status. This relates to their immigration status rather than their place of birth or their national or ethnic origin, or, indeed, their citizenship.\n[135] The Supreme Court of Canada has further observed that it is \u201cthe most fundamental principle of immigration law\u201d that non-citizens do not have an unqualified right to enter or remain in Canada: Chiarelli v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 711, 90 D.L.R. (4th) 289 at 733. The Court further observed in Chiarelli that Parliament has the right to adopt an immigration policy, and to enact legislation prescribing the conditions under which non-citizens will be permitted to enter and remain in Canada: at para. 24. Requiring that applicants who wish to immigrate to Canada or become Canadian citizens pay certain fees is within this domain of policy making, as long as such individuals are not targeted in a discriminatory fashion. As explained above, the appellants are subject to the Fees because of their immigration status and not their citizenship, which is neither an enumerated nor an analogous ground.\n[136] Consequently, it is plain and obvious that no reasonable cause of action based on section 15 is possible based on citizenship, and the Federal Court did not err in denying the appellants leave to amend their statement of claim.\nX. The Federal Court\u2019s Failure to Address the Other Four Certification Criteria [137] A motion to certify an action as a class proceeding in the Federal Courts is governed by Rule 334.16(1) of the Federal Courts Rules. This Rule states that a judge shall certify a proceeding as a class proceeding if the following five requirements are met:\nthe pleadings disclose a reasonable cause of action;\nthere is an identifiable class of two or more persons;\nthe claims of the class members raise common questions of law or fact (whether or not those common questions predominate over questions affecting only individual members);\na class proceeding is the preferable procedure for the just and efficient resolution of the common questions of law or fact; and\nthere is a representative plaintiff or applicant who would fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.\n[138] This list is conjunctive: that is, the Court must be satisfied that all five requirements are satisfied in a given case before the Court can certify an action as a class proceeding: Buffalo v. Samson First Nation, 2008 FC 1308 at para. 35, aff\u2019d 2010 FCA 165 at para. 3.\n[139] As discussed earlier, the Federal Court found that the appellants\u2019 statement of claim in this case did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. Consequently, the first of the five certification criteria was not satisfied, and it followed that the appellants\u2019 certification motion must necessarily fail.\n[140] Having found that the first of the certification criteria had not been satisfied in this case, it was entirely open to the Federal Court to determine that it was unnecessary to consider the remaining four certification criteria. Given that all of the certification requirements had to be satisfied before the action could be certified as a class proceeding, there was nothing that the Federal Court could decide with respect to the four remaining criteria that could have affected the outcome of the certification motion.\n[141] That is, the existence of, for example, important common questions of law or a strong litigation plan could not make up for the lack of a reasonable cause of action in the certification process: Bou Malhab v. Diffusion M\u00e9trom\u00e9dia CMR inc., 2011 SCC 9 at para. 52.\n[142] Whether or not to address the remaining outstanding issues in such circumstances was a matter wholly within the discretion of the motions judge. As noted earlier, this Court should not interfere with discretionary decisions of the Federal Court absent an error of law or a palpable and overriding error on a question of fact or of mixed fact and law, and the appellants have not identified a reviewable error in the Federal Court\u2019s exercise of discretion in this regard.\nXI. Proposed Disposition [143] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal. In accordance with Rule 334.39 I would not order costs with respect to the appellants\u2019 certification motion, and in the exercise of my discretion, I would make no order as to costs in relation to Canada\u2019s motion to strike.\n\u201cAnne L.

Zinn, the Infringement Decision) which found that the respondent, Sonos Inc. (Sonos), did not infringe claim 7 of Google\u2019s Canadian Patent No. 2,545,150 (the 150 Patent). Google also appeals a subsequent Order of Justice Zinn dated September 1, 2022, which ordered Google to pay Sonos\u2019 costs (the Costs Decision).\n[2] Google argues that the Federal Court erred in three respects in the Infringement Decision, two concerning the interpretation of terms used in claim 7 and the third concerning the application of another term used in claim 7 in assessing infringement. Specifically, Google takes issue with the Federal Court\u2019s interpretation of (i) \u201cecho cancellation\u201d, and (ii) \u201can order\u201d. Though Google does not take issue with the Federal Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cadaptively determine\u201d, it argues that the Federal Court erred in its application of this term in its infringement analysis. Google acknowledges that, in order to be successful in its appeal of the Infringement Decision, it must convince this Court that the Federal Court erred in respect of both (i) application of the term \u201cadaptively determine\u201d, and (ii) construction of at least one of the terms \u201cecho cancellation\u201d and \u201can order\u201d.\n[3] I would dismiss the appeal of the Infringement Decision.\n[4] The 150 Patent concerns a system for adaptive echo and noise control in electronic equipment such as smart speakers of the type marketed by Sonos. The system cancels echo and suppresses noise that might interfere with communication, such as voice commands. Echo cancellation minimizes echo caused by the sound coming from the speaker or other electronic equipment. Noise suppression improves communication in an environment with unwanted sounds. Claim 7 of the 150 Patent defines an electronic device having both an echo canceller and a noise suppressor, wherein \u201can order of echo cancellation and noise suppression\u201d is \u201cadaptively determine[d]\u201d based on \u201can amount of noise\u201d.\n[5] Before addressing the claim construction issues raised by Google, a comment on the standard of review would be helpful. The parties agree that the applicable standard of review in the present appeals is as indicated in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235: questions of law are reviewed on a standard of correctness, and questions of fact or of mixed fact and law from which no question of law is extricable are reviewed on a standard of palpable and overriding error.\n[6] The parties disagree on whether the claim construction issues are questions of law or questions of mixed fact and law. In theory, the interpretation of a patent claim, like the interpretation of a statute or a regulation, is a question of law, subject to the correctness standard: Whirlpool Corp. v. Camco Inc., 2000 SCC 67, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1067 at paras. 61, 76 (Whirlpool). However, patent claims are interpreted from the point of view of a person skilled in the art: Whirlpool at para. 48. Expert evidence is often considered in determining how such a person would have understood certain terms in a claim at the relevant date. The weighing of this evidence is a question of mixed fact and law. Therefore, where the interpretation of a patent claim turns on the weight given to expert evidence, this Court will intervene only where there is a palpable and overriding error: Biogen Canada Inc. v. Pharmascience Inc., 2022 FCA 143, 196 C.P.R. (4th) 120 at para. 38; ABB Technology AG v. Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd., 2015 FCA 181, 132 C.P.R. (4th) 405 at paras. 22\u201323.\n[7] In this case, the Federal Court found that, in the context of the 150 Patent, the term \u201cecho\u201d is distinct from, and not simply a type of, \u201cnoise\u201d. Therefore, echo cancellation and noise suppression are distinct processes. In reaching this conclusion, the Federal Court relied on expert evidence (see paragraphs 47 to 52 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons).\n[8] Google argues that the Federal Court erred by failing to address its argument that \u201cecho cancellation\u201d encompasses any mechanism to minimize echo, and is not limited to a mechanism that uses a reference signal and a cancellation point. In simpler terms, Google argues that \u201cecho cancellation\u201d is not limited to the method described in the 150 Patent: using a saved version of an outgoing signal (e.g. what the speakers are playing) to cancel its echo. Google argues that \u201cecho cancellation\u201d extends to the minimization of echo by other means. These other means treat echo as a type of noise and are essentially a type of noise suppression. Google argues that the Federal Court did not explicitly address this point; nor implicitly address the point in concluding that echo cancellation and noise suppression are distinct processes.\n[9] In my view, the Federal Court found that echo cancellation and noise suppression are distinct processes based on a conclusion that, in the context of the 150 Patent, echo is distinct from noise (see paragraphs 51 and 52 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons), and echo cancellation is distinct from echo suppression (see paragraphs 77 and 78 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons). It follows from this that the Federal Court rejected Google\u2019s argument that \u201cecho cancellation\u201d encompasses activities that are essentially noise suppression. I disagree with Google\u2019s submission that the Federal Court failed to consider this construction issue.\n[10] I find no merit in Google\u2019s argument that such a conclusion was not available to the Federal Court because it would violate a fundamental principle of claim construction\u2014i.e., giving claim 7 of the 150 Patent exactly the same scope as claim 8, which is dependent from, and should be narrower than, claim 7. Claim 8 is limited to an echo canceller with certain features. The Federal Court\u2019s interpretation of claim 7 does not limit the scope of the echo canceller defined therein to those features defined in claim 8.\n[11] With regard to the term \u201can order\u201d in the phrase \u201can order of echo cancellation and noise suppression\u201d Google argues that the Federal Court erred in failing to recognize that this term could encompass an order in which either the echo cancellation or the noise suppression was available but not performed.\n[12] The Federal Court considered this issue and weighed the conflicting expert evidence (see paragraphs 59 to 64 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons). It concluded that there is no \u201corder of echo cancellation and noise suppression\u201d where only one of those functions is performed. Google argues that nothing in the 150 Patent supports the statement at paragraph 64 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons that \u201cthe device of Claim 7 must have at least two operating states that include both noise suppression and echo cancellation\u201d. In my view, this statement is not an erroneous interpretation of claim 7. Rather, it simply recognizes that the claimed device must permit the operations of echo cancellation and noise suppression to be performed in at least two different orders. In my view, it was open to the Federal Court to favour one expert over the other and to reach the conclusion it did concerning the meaning of \u201can order\u201d.\n[13] Based on Google\u2019s acknowledgement that it must convince this Court that the Federal Court erred on at least one of the claim construction issues, the foregoing is sufficient to dismiss the appeal of the Infringement Decision. It is not necessary to consider the Federal Court\u2019s application of the term \u201cadaptively determine\u201d. It is also not necessary to consider Sonos\u2019 argument that, even if Google were successful in its arguments, there would be no infringement by Sonos.\n[14] Google\u2019s appeal of the Costs Decision depends on success in its appeal of the Infringement Decision. Accordingly, no more need be said on the appeal of the Costs Decision.\n[15] For these reasons, I would dismiss both appeals with costs. Based on the parties\u2019 agreement, I would set the amount of costs at $15,000, all-inclusive.\n\"George R.

The passages in the notice of appeal relate to the appellant\u2019s argument on the validity of the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 2, S.C. 2014, c. 39 [EAP 2014 Act]. The Tax Court\u2019s decision to allow the respondent to file its reply within 60 days of the Court\u2019s order is not being appealed.\n[2] The underlying tax appeal concerns the appellant\u2019s claim for the Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit (CPTC) and whether a contribution by Telefilm Canada was \u201cassistance\u201d for the purposes of subsection 125.4(1) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.). The EAP 2014 Act amended the definition of \u201cassistance\u201d (retroactively) and provided a basis for the Minister\u2019s reassessment of the appellant\u2019s 2011 taxation year reducing the appellant\u2019s CPTC.\n[3] The appellant filed an appeal in the Tax Court, challenging, among other things, the validity of the EAP 2014 Act. Its position was that when the EAP 2014 Act was passed, the Senate had 17 vacancies, rendering the EAP 2014 Act invalid, according to the Constitution Act, 1867 (U.K.), 30 & 31 Vict., c. 3, reprinted in R.S.C. 1985, Appendix II, No. 5. The argument is that there was insufficient representation from the provinces and territories in the Senate, the Senate was not properly constituted and thus could not validly pass legislation.\n[4] The respondent successfully moved to strike the passages in the notice of appeal relating to this argument, on the basis that it had no reasonable prospect of success.\n[5] The appellate standards of review from Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 apply to interlocutory decisions of the Tax Court: Canada v. Preston, 2023 FCA 178 at para. 12; Kinglon Investments Inc. v. Canada, 2015 FCA 134 at para. 5. These standards are correctness for questions of law, and palpable and overriding error for questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law, unless there is an extricable question of law, which is reviewable for correctness.\n[6] Here, the standard of review is correctness, as the appeal raises a question of law \u2014 the Tax Court\u2019s decision to strike the passages was based on its interpretation of sections 21, 22, and 35 of the Constitution Act, 1867.\n[7] We see no error in the Tax Court\u2019s decision requiring this Court\u2019s intervention. The Tax Court correctly stated and applied the test for striking out pleadings \u2014 whether it is \u201cplain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action\u201d: R. v. Imperial Tobacco, 2011 SCC 42 at para. 17; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Canada, 2013 FCA 122 at para. 7; TCC Reasons at paras. 27-28.\n[8] The Tax Court considered the respondent\u2019s arguments in support of its motion to strike: (a) that the Tax Court does not have jurisdiction to review whether the Senate validly passed the EAP 2014 Act, as this is within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament; and (b) the Senate vacancy argument.\n[9] The Tax Court declined to strike the relevant passages on the basis of the jurisdiction argument: TCC Reasons at paras. 30-43. In the absence of sufficient submissions from the parties, and as the Tax Court decision did not turn on this issue, we decline to address the jurisdiction issue. In doing so, we do not endorse the Tax Court\u2019s reasons. The Tax Court, in obiter, suggested that it could grant a declaration of invalidity if the appellant\u2019s argument were to succeed: TCC Reasons at paras. 62-68. For similar reasons, we decline to address this issue, and in doing so do not endorse the Tax Court\u2019s reasons.\n[10] On the Senate vacancy issue, we agree with the Tax Court\u2019s reasons: TCC Reasons at paras. 44-61. The Tax Court adopted an interpretation of sections 21, 22, and 35 of the Constitution Act, 1867 that is consistent with their text, context, and purpose. We disagree with the appellant\u2019s submissions that the Tax Court took a purely textual approach.\n[11] As the Tax Court concluded, the language of sections 21 and 22 \u2014 which concern the number of senators and the representation of provinces respectively \u2014 is \u201csubject to the Provisions of this Act\u201d: TCC Reasons at para. 46. We reject the appellant\u2019s argument that the \u201csubject to\u201d language is limited in its application to sections 26, 27 and 28 of the Constitution Act, 1867.\n[12] Crucially, section 35 makes it clear that the Senate may exercise its powers notwithstanding any vacancies, as long as there is a quorum of senators:\nQuorum of Senate\nQuorum du S\u00e9nat\n35 Until the Parliament of Canada otherwise provides, the Presence of at least Fifteen Senators, including the Speaker, shall be necessary to constitute a Meeting of the Senate for the Exercise of its Powers.\n35 Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le parlement du Canada en ordonne autrement, la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019au moins quinze s\u00e9nateurs, y compris l\u2019orateur, sera n\u00e9cessaire pour constituer une assembl\u00e9e du S\u00e9nat dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions.\n[13] Accordingly, it was plain and obvious that the appellant\u2019s Senate vacancy argument had no reasonable prospect of success: TCC Reasons at para. 61. As noted at the hearing in this Court, the untenable implication of the appellant\u2019s Senate vacancy argument is that any legislation passed by a quorum of the Senate when there are vacancies in the Senate could also be invalid.\n[14] The appellant has not established that the Tax Court erred. We will dismiss the appeal, with costs. The parties shall have 30 days to advise the Court as to their agreement on quantum or, failing agreement, to make written submissions on quantum.\n\u201cMonica Biringer\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-22-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nFU2 PRODUCTIONS LTD. v.

Overview [1] The applicant, Ms. Molchan, seeks judicial review of a decision of the Appeal Division of the Social Security Tribunal dated February 10, 2023 (2023 SST 139).\n[2] In February 2020, Ms. Molchan stopped working because of injuries caused in a car accident. As her sickness benefits were about to expire in June 2020, Ms. Molchan contacted the Canada Employment Insurance Commission to indicate that she had not yet recovered and could not return to work. Believing that she was acting on the advice of the Commission, she made a claim for regular benefits and reported that she was capable of and available for work. The Commission approved her application and she collected regular benefits for an additional 25 weeks.\n[3] On March 4, 2021, the Commission contacted Ms. Molchan to discuss her availability for work. She confirmed to the Commission that she was not capable of working during the period she collected regular benefits. When asked why she reported being capable of working, she responded that she had done so on the advice of the two Service Canada agents to whom she had explained her situation in June 2020 (Applicant\u2019s record at 161).\n[4] On March 11, 2021, the Commission retroactively reconsidered Ms. Molchan\u2019s entitlement to regular benefits and decided that she was not capable of and available for work, thereby creating an overpayment (Applicant\u2019s record at 172). Ms. Molchan sought reconsideration, but the Commission upheld its decision (Applicant\u2019s record at 183).\n[5] Ms. Molchan appealed the Commission\u2019s decision to the General Division of the Social Security Tribunal, arguing that the Commission has no authority to reconsider a decision on availability unless presented with new facts. She maintained that she had been truthful and forthcoming about her situation and availability status from the beginning and that there were no new facts to justify reconsideration of her availability. She insisted that the Service Canada agents had exercised their discretion to determine she was eligible for regular benefits and had told her to declare in her biweekly reports that she was available for work even though she was not. She further argued that the Commission had not followed its reconsideration policy, which provides that the Commission will not retroactively review decisions about availability if the Commission incorrectly paid benefits.\n[6] The General Division dismissed Ms. Molchan\u2019s appeal (2022 SST 1625). In its decision dated May 30, 2022, the General Division began by indicating that it believed Ms. Molchan had received misleading advice about how to claim benefits after her sickness benefits ended. It then held that the Commission\u2019s authority under section 52 of the Employment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996, c. 23 (EIA) to retroactively reconsider Ms. Molchan\u2019s entitlement to benefits is a discretionary decision and found that the Commission had exercised its discretion judicially. As it was uncontested that Ms. Molchan was not capable of working during the period she received benefits, the General Division concluded that Ms. Molchan had not demonstrated she was entitled to regular benefits (Applicant\u2019s record at 246-253).\n[7] The Appeal Division dismissed Ms. Molchan\u2019s appeal. It agreed with the parties that the General Division erred when it decided that the Commission only had to show that it reconsidered Ms. Molchan\u2019s claim within the statutory time limit to prove it exercised its discretion properly. The Appeal Division then substituted its decision for that of the General Division and found that the Commission had not exercised its discretion judicially because it had failed to consider relevant factors as required by the case law.\n[8] The Appeal Division subsequently examined whether discretion should be exercised to reconsider the claim. After noting several factors arguing against reconsideration, the Appeal Division found that Ms. Molchan\u2019s false statements were pivotal to the Commission\u2019s assessment of her availability for work. Noting that the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy lists false statements as one of the grounds in favour of reconsideration, the Appeal Division considered whether the policy should apply given that the Commission\u2019s agents had directed Ms. Molchan to make the false statements. After considering that a claimant cannot rely on misinformation from the Commission to be relieved of an overpayment, the Appeal Division reached the same conclusion as the Commission and maintained the overpayment.\n[9] Before this Court, Ms. Molchan submits that the Appeal Division erred in concluding, first, that the Commission could retroactively reconsider her availability in the absence of new information and, second, that she had made false statements within the meaning of the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy. In the alternative, she claims that the Appeal Division erred in concluding that the Commission had exercised its discretion judicially.\nII. Analysis A. Standard of Review [10] The parties agree that the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is reviewable on the deferential standard of reasonableness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65; Page v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 169 at para. 48; Canada (Attorney General) v. Hull, 2022 FCA 82 at paras. 12-13; Hillier v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 44 at para. 12).\n[11] When the standard of reasonableness applies, the Court\u2019s focus is on \u201cwhether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision\u201d (Vavilov at para. 99). It must be internally coherent, and display a rational chain of analysis (Vavilov at para. 85). The burden is on the party challenging the decision to show that it is unreasonable and the Court \u201cmust be satisfied that any shortcomings or flaws relied on \u2026 are sufficiently central or significant to render the decision unreasonable\u201d (Vavilov at para. 100).\n[12] One of the relevant constraints is subsection 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act, S.C. 2005, c. 34 (DESDA). The Appeal Division can only intervene if the General Division (a) failed to observe a principle of natural justice or otherwise acted beyond or refused to exercise its jurisdiction; (b) erred in law in making its decision, whether or not the error appears on the face of the record; or (c) based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it. Paragraph 58(1)(c) of the DESDA does not allow the Appeal Division to overturn a decision of the General Division on the basis that it would have weighed the evidence differently (Sibbald v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 157 at para. 27; Uvaliyev v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 222 at para. 7).\n[13] Once the Appeal Division finds there is a legitimate reason to intervene, it may proceed to decide questions of fact that are necessary for the disposition of the appeal (Nelson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 222 at para. 17) and give the decision the General Division should have given or refer the matter back for reconsideration in accordance with any directions it considers appropriate (DESDA, subsection 59(1)).\nB. Reconsideration of Ms. Molchan\u2019s claim [14] At the outset, it is useful to set out the statutory and policy framework relevant to this application.\n(1) Relevant Framework [15] Employment insurance benefits are payable to claimants who meet the statutory requirements. To receive benefits, claimants must first qualify to receive benefits. They must demonstrate that they have suffered an interruption of earnings from employment and that they have had a minimum number of hours of insurable employment in a period preceding the claim (EIA, ss. 7, 8).\n[16] Claimants must also not be disentitled to receive benefits. Pursuant to paragraph 18(1)(a) of the EIA, a claimant is not entitled to benefits if the claimant fails to prove that they were capable of and available for work and unable to obtain suitable employment.\n[17] Subsection 52(1) of the EIA provides that the Commission may reconsider a claim for benefits within 36 months after benefits have been paid or would have been payable. If the Commission decides that a person has received money by way of benefits for which the person was not qualified or to which the person was not entitled, the Commission may seek repayment of the monies overpaid under subsections 52(2) and 52(3) of the EIA. If the Commission is of the opinion that a false or misleading statement or representation was made in connection with the claim, the Commission has an additional 36 months within which to reconsider the claim (EIA, subsection 52(5)).\n[18] In exercising its discretion to reconsider a claim, the Commission is guided by a number of principles set out in its Digest of Benefit Entitlement Principles. Chapter 17 of the Digest addresses among other things, error correction and reconsideration. Sections 17.3.2.2, 17.3.3 and 17.3.3.2 are relevant to this application.\n[19] Section 17.3.2.2 provides that a Commission error will occur when the Commission has all the relevant information needed to make a decision, but the information does not support the final decision. If benefits were incorrectly paid, the Commission will correct the error currently and no overpayment will be created. However, if the error resulted in a decision that is contrary to the structure of the EIA, the Commission will correct the error retroactively and an overpayment will occur.\n[20] Additionally, section 17.3.3, entitled \u201cReconsideration policy\u201d, provides that the Commission has developed a policy to ensure a consistent and fair application of section 52 of the EIA and to prevent creating debt when a claimant was overpaid through no fault of their own. It further states that a claim will only be reconsidered when (1) benefits have been underpaid, (2) benefits were paid contrary to the structure of the EIA, (3) benefits were paid as a result of a false or misleading statement, and (4) the claimant ought to have known there was no entitlement to the benefits received. Section 17.3.3.2 specifies that decisions on availability are not decisions that run contrary to the structure of the EIA.\n(2) Absence of New Information [21] Ms. Molchan submits that the Appeal Division erred in finding that the Commission could reconsider her availability in the absence of any new information. She argues that allowing retroactive reconsideration in the absence of new information undermines the central object and purpose of the employment insurance scheme, which is to provide financial security to those put out of work through no fault of their own. She further argues that the power to retroactively reconsider a claim is an exceptional one and should be construed strictly.\n[22] Ms. Molchan has failed to persuade me that the Appeal Division erred in this regard.\n[23] The Appeal Division concluded that the Commission had the authority to reconsider Ms. Molchan\u2019s claim for benefits, even in the absence of new information. In reaching this conclusion, the Appeal Division compared the Commission\u2019s authority to reconsider a claim for benefits under section 52 of the EIA with its authority to rescind or amend a decision under section 111 of the EIA. The Appeal Division noted that, under section 111, the Commission has the authority to rescind or amend a decision given in any particular claim if new facts are presented, or if it is satisfied that the decision was given without the knowledge of, or was based on a mistake as to, some material facts. In contrast, section 52 applies despite section 111 and is not limited to situations of new facts or mistakes of material facts. On this basis, the Appeal Division held that the reconsideration authority under section 52 was much broader than what Ms. Molchan advanced (AD Decision at paras. 67-69).\n[24] While finding that new facts are not required for the Commission to exercise its reconsideration authority under section 52 of the EIA, the Appeal Division nonetheless agreed with Ms. Molchan that the absence of new facts is a relevant factor for the Commission to consider, as it goes to the finality of a decision. However, it added that other factors are equally relevant. One such factor, under the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy, is false statements (AD Decision at paras. 75-76).\n[25] The Appeal Division went on to add that, if it was wrong and new facts are indeed required for the Commission to exercise its authority under section 52 of the EIA, reconsideration of Ms. Molchan\u2019s claim was appropriate given that the overpayment did not arise because the Commission changed its mind on the same facts. While the Commission may have mistakenly decided that Ms. Molchan was initially entitled to benefits, her ongoing entitlement was assessed based on the information she provided in her bi-weekly reports, which was different from that initially reported verbally to the Commission.\n[26] The Appeal Division explained that, starting the week of June 21, 2020, Ms. Molchan consistently answered \u201cyes\u201d in her biweekly reports when asked whether she was \u201cready, willing and capable of working each day, Monday through Friday, during each week of this report\u201d. The Appeal Division found that this information was different from the information that she had previously provided to the Commission (AD Decision at paras. 79-81).\n[27] Indeed, the record shows that, on June 19, 2020, the Commission formed the view that Ms. Molchan could transition to regular benefits on the premise that she was available for and capable of working, but not capable of doing the same work as in her previous employment because she could not sit for an extended period (Applicant\u2019s record at 152). This information is different from the information she gave to the Commission on March 4, 2021 when she confirmed to the agent that she could not work at all (Applicant\u2019s record at 161). On this basis, I am satisfied that the Appeal Division could reasonably conclude that there was new information justifying reconsideration of the claim.\n[28] In any event, I find that the Appeal Division\u2019s conclusion that new facts or information are not required under section 52 of the EIA for the Commission to reconsider a claimant\u2019s entitlement is reasonable. First, subsection 52(1) of the EIA begins with the words \u201cDespite section 111\u201d (\u201cMalgr\u00e9 l\u2019article 111\u201d). These words clearly suggest that the scope of subsection 52(1) is much broader than the power of rescission or amendment found in section 111 of the EIA, which is limited to the presentation of new facts. Second, the Appeal Division\u2019s interpretation is also consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in Bri\u00e8re v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission), [1989] 3 F.C. 88, 57 D.L.R. (4th) 402 (F.C.A.), where the Court found that the equivalent of these provisions served different purposes (Bri\u00e8re at 112-114).\n(3) False statements [29] Ms. Molchan also submits that the Appeal Division could not reasonably find that she gave false information when she specifically reported what she was told to report.\n[30] The Appeal Division accepted Ms. Molchan\u2019s submission that she was following the advice she received from the Commission\u2019s agents. However, it found that the statements made in the biweekly reports were nonetheless inaccurate (AD Decision at para. 84). The Appeal Division noted that a decision about capability and availability is not a onetime decision binding for the life of the benefit period and added that claimants must prove they are capable of and available for work for every working day in the benefit period (AD Decision at para. 85).\n[31] In my view, the Appeal Division\u2019s reasoning is both factually reasonable and consistent with paragraph 18(1)(a) of the EIA and the relevant case law. Although her biweekly reports indicated the contrary, Ms. Molchan admitted that she was not capable of and available for work during the period she collected regular EI benefits.\n[32] That said, the Appeal Division nonetheless considered whether it should refrain from applying the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy given that Ms. Molchan was directed by the Commission to make the false statements (AD Decision at para. 113). Relying on the decision of this Court in Canada (Attorney General) v. Buors, 2002 FCA 372, the Appeal Division held that Ms. Molchan could not rely on the Commission\u2019s misinformation to avoid an overpayment.\n[33] While Ms. Molchan may not agree with the Appeal Division\u2019s interpretation of the Commission\u2019s authority to reconsider her claim, she has not persuaded me that the Appeal Division\u2019s findings are unreasonable.\nC. Judicial exercise of discretion [34] In her memorandum of fact and law, Ms. Molchan submits that the Appeal Division erred in concluding that the Commission had exercised its discretion to reconsider the claim judicially. However, it is not what the Appeal Division concluded. It found the contrary.\n[35] Nonetheless, Ms. Molchan argues that the Appeal Division misconstrued this Court\u2019s decision in Buors. She also contends that the Appeal Division unreasonably determined that financial hardship and delay were not relevant factors to the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion to retroactively reconsider the claim. Finally, she is of the view that the Appeal Division unreasonably concluded that her claim should be retroactively reconsidered in all of the circumstances.\n[36] Ms. Molchan\u2019s arguments must fail.\n[37] First, the Appeal Division reasonably applied this Court\u2019s decision in Buors to find that Ms. Molchan could not rely on the Commission\u2019s misinformation to avoid the application of the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy.\n[38] Ms. Molchan had argued that her situation was distinguishable from the situation in Buors because that case involved a decision about a benefit rate, which rate was set by law and went to the structure of the EIA. The Appeal Division disagreed, finding instead that the decision in Buors was about the allocation of unreported earnings, which did not run contrary to the structure of the EIA, as defined by the Commission. The Appeal Division found that, in both cases, the overpayments had arisen due to misinformation about how to complete the reports. As a result, it felt bound by the direction of this Court in Buors (AD Decision at paras. 119-122).\n[39] I find that the Appeal Division\u2019s findings are consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in Buors, which followed the majority decision in Granger v. Canada Employment and Immigration Commission, [1986] 3 F.C. 70, 29 D.L.R. (4th) 501 (F.C.A.) (Granger), later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in Granger v. Canada (Canada Employment and Immigration Commission), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 141. This Court held in Granger that \u201cthe Commission and its representatives have no power to amend the law, and \u2026 therefore the interpretations which they may give of that law do not themselves have the force of law. \u2026 any commitment which [they] may give, whether in good or bad faith, to act in a way other than that prescribed by the law would be absolutely void and contrary to public order\u201d (Granger at 77). The Appeal Division\u2019s findings are also consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in Paxton v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 FCA 360 at paragraphs 14-15. The Appeal Division could not ignore this relevant case law.\n[40] Second, I am satisfied that the Appeal Division\u2019s treatment of financial hardship and delay was reasonable.\n[41] After deciding to substitute its decision for that of the General Division, the Appeal Division examined which factors are relevant to the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion to reconsider a claim. It began by noting that the EIA is silent on what factors are relevant to the exercise of discretion under section 52 of the EIA, but indicated that another decision of the Appeal Division, M.S. v. Canada Employment Insurance Commission, 2022 SST 933, had previously examined the issue in detail. The Appeal Division observed that in M.S., another member had found that factors that help resolve the tension between claimants\u2019 ability to rely on the finality of decisions and the Commission\u2019s interest in their accuracy are relevant to the exercise of discretion. The member had determined that the factors set out in the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy address this tension and are therefore relevant. However, it had added that, while the Commission should consider the factors in the policy, it is not necessarily bound to apply them (AD Decision at paras. 43-48).\n[42] The Appeal Division agreed with the reasoning in M.S. and applied it to Ms. Molchan\u2019s situation. It added that there may be additional relevant factors aside from those listed in the policy, but specified that relevant factors are those that relate to finality and accuracy (AD Decision at para. 49).\n[43] Applying these principles, the Appeal Division agreed with Ms. Molchan that, in exercising its discretion to reconsider the claim, the Commission had overlooked certain factors that the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy identifies as relevant. Specifically, it noted that the Commission had failed to consider the impact of the Commission\u2019s error on Ms. Molchan as well as the absence of fault on Ms. Molchan\u2019s part. The Appeal Division also found that the Commission had failed to take into account a factor which relates to the finality of the decision, namely that Ms. Molchan\u2019s reliance on the initial mistaken decision had led her not to pursue other possible pandemic-related benefits (AD Decision at paras. 97-100). Likewise, the Appeal Division noted that the Commission had not considered Ms. Molchan\u2019s honesty in dealing with the Commission (AD Decision at para. 103).\n[44] However, the Appeal Division disagreed with Ms. Molchan on the relevance of other factors. Ms. Molchan had argued that the Commission\u2019s delay in addressing her entitlement had created a large debt and put her in a difficult financial situation in having to repay it. The Appeal Division found that the argument of delay was not relevant, as the Commission had acted within the statutory period (AD Decision at para. 102). The Appeal Division further found irrelevant that the Commission had not considered Ms. Molchan\u2019s financial hardship. The Appeal Division observed that financial hardship does not go directly to either of the factors of finality or accuracy; rather it is meant to be taken into account in the context of the write-off procedure provided in the legislation, in particular at subparagraph 56(1)(f)(ii) of the Employment Insurance Regulations, S.O.R.\/96-332 (AD Decision at para. 102). In the end, the Appeal Division concluded that the Commission had not exercised its discretion judicially when it failed to consider all relevant factors (AD Decision at para. 104).\n[45] Having reached this conclusion, the Appeal Division then proceeded to give the decision the General Division should have given and considered whether discretion should be exercised to reconsider the claim. After noting several factors arguing against reconsideration, the Appeal Division found that Ms. Molchan\u2019s false statements, albeit made innocently, were pivotal to the Commission\u2019s assessment of her availability for work. Had she accurately declared that she was not capable of work, the Commission could have corrected its initial error and Ms. Molchan would have stopped receiving benefits. Despite noting that the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy lists false statements as a ground for reconsideration, the Appeal Division nonetheless considered whether the policy should be applied given that Ms. Molchan was directed to make false statements by the Commission. The Appeal Division felt bound by this Court\u2019s decision in Buors and determined that the claim was to be reconsidered, meaning that the overpayment remained.\n[46] Ms. Molchan relies on this Court\u2019s decision in Canada (Attorney General) v. Schembri, 2003 FCA 463 to argue that financial hardship is a relevant factor when the Commission exercises its discretion.\n[47] It does not appear from the record that Schembri was raised directly before either the General Division or the Appeal Division.\n[48] In any event, I find that the Schembri decision is distinguishable.\n[49] The issue in Schembri was whether the Commission was bound to take into account the claimant\u2019s financial circumstances when determining the penalty to impose. The claimant in that case had failed to report his earnings and collected unemployment benefits for several months. The Commission had calculated that the claimant had received a benefit overpayment of $4,130, which it sought to recover. It had also assessed a penalty under section 38 of the EIA, because the claimant had received unemployment benefits by knowingly misreporting his income contrary to paragraph 38(1)(c) of the EIA. In determining the amount of penalty payable, the Commission considered the claimant\u2019s gambling addiction and his efforts to deal with it, and reduced the penalty by 25% to $3,097. The Board of Referees later exonerated the claimant from any penalty. The Umpire then found that the Commission had erred when it failed to undertake, on its own initiative, an inquiry into the claimant\u2019s financial circumstances and whether it would cause the claimant undue hardship to pay the proposed penalty. The Umpire reduced the penalty imposed by the Commission from 75% to 10% of the amount of the overpayment.\n[50] On judicial review, this Court held that the Commission was not required to initiate its own inquiries into a person\u2019s financial circumstances before it imposed a penalty, noting that claimants have ample opportunities to request a reduction of the penalty on the ground of financial hardship at various stages of the process: before the penalty is imposed, on request for reconsideration and on appeal to the Board of Referees (Schembri at para. 14). Since the claimant had not raised the issue with the Commission and the Board of Referees, this Court decided that the Umpire should have held that the Board had no basis to interfere with the penalty.\n[51] In my view, this Court\u2019s findings in Schembri do not extend to the reconsideration of a claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits. The overpayment in Schembri was not in dispute, only the amount of penalty the claimant would have to pay. Subsection 38(1) of the EIA specifies the acts or omissions for which a claimant may be subject to a penalty and subsection 38(2) sets the maximum penalties the Commission may impose. Under section 41 of the EIA, the Commission may rescind the imposition of a penalty or reduce it, on the presentation of new facts or on being satisfied that the penalty was imposed without knowledge of, or on the basis of a mistake as to, some material fact. Furthermore the Commission may issue, under section 41.1, a warning instead of setting the amount of a penalty for an act or omission under subsections 38(2) and 39(2) of the EIA. The Commission thus enjoys a wide discretion in assessing the amount of penalty and may consider financial hardship to the claimant as a mitigating factor.\n[52] This is consistent with the Commission\u2019s policy regarding penalties, which mentions financial hardship as a possible mitigating circumstance when determining penalties (Digest of Benefit Entitlement Principles, section 18.5.2.2). It appears from the record that the Commission did not apply a penalty in Ms. Molchan\u2019s case despite her false statements (Applicant\u2019s record at 130, 173, 178).\n[53] In contrast, the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion under section 52 of the EIA is tied to a claimant\u2019s qualification for, or entitlement to, benefits and is guided by the factors set out in the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy and those that relate to finality and accuracy. The Commission\u2019s policy does not list financial hardship as a factor. While the Appeal Division acknowledged that there may be other relevant factors, I have not been persuaded that financial hardship goes directly to either finality or accuracy.\n[54] When the Commission finds, upon reconsideration, that the claimant was not entitled to receive benefits, it is required under subsection 52(2) to calculate the amount to which the claimant was not entitled and notify the claimant. Pursuant to subsection 52(3), the amount calculated is repayable under section 43 of the EIA, which provides that a claimant is liable to repay an amount paid by the Commission as benefits and to which the claimant was not entitled. An amount payable under this provision becomes a debt due to His Majesty under subsection 47(1) of the EIA. Although the Commission has the discretion to reconsider the claim within a specified period, the Commission enjoys no discretion in setting the amount to be repaid since liability arises directly from a determination that the claimant was disentitled from receiving benefits (Canada (Attorney General) v. L\u00e9vesque, 2001 FCA 304 at para. 2). This is different from the Commission setting the amount of penalty a claimant should pay.\n[55] In my view, the Appeal Division\u2019s comments regarding Ms. Molchan\u2019s ability to seek a write-off of her debt are consistent with the legislation, which sets out a specific procedure, a write-off, for undue hardship cases. Subparagraph 56(1)(f)(ii) of the Employment Insurance Regulations explicitly provides the Commission with the authority to write off an amount payable under section 43 of the EIA if repayment of the amount due would result in undue hardship to the claimant.\n[56] That said, I am nonetheless of the view that the Appeal Division was clearly cognizant of and empathetic to the financial hardship to Ms. Molchan in having to repay her debt. Like the General Division, the Appeal Division implored the Commission and the Canada Revenue Agency to consider any request by Ms. Molchan to write off her debt, given the circumstances in which the overpayment arose. The Appeal Division even went as far as providing in a footnote the telephone number where she could call to seek relief.\n[57] Finally, Ms. Molchan also contends that the Appeal Division unreasonably concluded that her claim should be retroactively reconsidered in all of the circumstances. I find that she is essentially asking the Court to reassess the relevant factors and the weight afforded to them in order to reach a different outcome. That is not this Court\u2019s role on judicial review.\n[58] To conclude, despite her counsel\u2019s able submissions, I am satisfied that the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is reasonable. It is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and is justified in relation to the facts and the law it was required to apply in the circumstances (Vavilov at para. 85). Although I am sympathetic to Ms. Molchan\u2019s unfortunate situation, I am unable to find any basis upon which to intervene.\n[59] Accordingly, I would dismiss the application for judicial review. The respondent did not seek costs and none will be awarded.\n\"Sylvie E. Roussel\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nDavid Stratas J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nJohn B.

Overview [1] The applicant, Ms. T-Giorgis, seeks judicial review of a decision of the Appeal Division of the Social Security Tribunal dated February 24, 2023 (2023 SST 196).\n[2] Ms. T-Giorgis filed an initial application for employment insurance benefits on March 20, 2020. In her application, she reported that she was taking a full-time course of study on her own initiative. She received the new Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit (EI\u2011ERB) until September 27, 2020 and then transitioned to regular employment insurance benefits. Prior to the transition, she completed another training questionnaire detailing her academic program. She reported that she would be attending full-time, non-referred training from September 9, 2020 to December 8, 2020 and that she would spend between 15 and 24 hours a week on her studies. She also reported that her course obligations occurred outside her normal work hours and that she was obligated to attend her scheduled classes (Applicant\u2019s record at 259-262).\n[3] On October 27, 2020, the Canada Employment Insurance Commission called Ms. T\u2011Giorgis about her availability and confirmed that she was entitled to benefits while in her training course until December 15, 2020 (Applicant\u2019s record at 263). Ms. T-Giorgis continued to receive regular benefits until September 4, 2021. During this period, she continued to report in her biweekly reports that she was a full-time student and that she had worked part-time at various jobs during her studies.\n[4] After Ms. T-Giorgis completed her biweekly reports for the period starting in September 2021, the Commission referred her claim for review (Applicant\u2019s record at 491-492). On January 11, 2022, an agent of the Commission called Ms. T-Giorgis to discuss her schooling. Ms. T\u2011Giorgis stated that she was in a four-year university program that had started in September 2019 and expected to finish it in May 2023. She also informed the Commission that she was spending over 30 hours a week on her studies, that she was working part-time while going to school, and that she would not leave her courses in order to accept full-time work (Applicant\u2019s record at 493).\n[5] On January 19, 2022, the Commission sent Ms. T-Giorgis a letter informing her that she was not entitled to benefits from September 28, 2020 onward, because she had not proven her availability for work while attending non-referred training (Applicant\u2019s record at 496). The Commission\u2019s decision created an overpayment on Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 account. Ms. T\u2011Giorgis applied for reconsideration, but the Commission upheld its decision (Applicant\u2019s record at 505).\n[6] Ms. T-Giorgis then appealed the decision to the General Division of the Social Security Tribunal. On July 5, 2022, the General Division found that the Commission had made initial decisions to allow Ms. T\u2011Giorgis\u2019 training and pay her benefits until September 4, 2021 (2022 SST 1665). It also held that the Commission could verify her availability for work within her benefit period, even after benefits were paid, under section 153.161 of the Employment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996, c. 23 (EIA). However, the General Division determined that the Commission did not properly exercise its discretion to reconsider the claim retroactively, as it took into account an irrelevant factor and ignored others that were relevant.\n[7] The General Division then proceeded to make the decision the Commission should have made. It found that the Commission should not have reviewed the decision entitling Ms. T\u2011Giorgis to benefits until September 4, 2021 since nothing had changed in her situation to trigger a review of the initial decision. As for the period after that, the General Division found that the Commission had not made an initial entitlement decision. In reviewing the claimant\u2019s availability for work, the General Division determined that Ms. T-Giorgis was not available for work and upheld the disentitlement.\n[8] The Commission appealed the decision to the Appeal Division. It submitted that the General Division erred in determining that Ms. T-Giorgis was not disentitled to regular benefits for the period of September 2020 to September 2021. In particular, the Commission disagreed with the General Division\u2019s interpretation of section 153.161 of the EIA, arguing that decisions made under that provision constituted initial entitlement decisions. The Commission argued that the only decision it made on entitlement was on October 27, 2020, when it approved Ms. T\u2011Giorgis\u2019 benefits up to December 15, 2020. As for the period from December 16, 2020 to September 2021, the Commission asserted that it had not made a decision on entitlement until January 2022 when it verified Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 entitlement under section 153.161 of the EIA. The Commission also challenged the General Division\u2019s finding that it had not exercised its discretion judicially in reconsidering the claim.\n[9] The Appeal Division allowed the appeal in part. It agreed with the General Division that section 153.161 of the EIA does not permit a delayed entitlement decision (AD Decision at para. 55). Section 153.161 of the EIA allows the Commission to make an initial entitlement decision based on the statements made by a claimant in their application for benefits and their claimant reports, and to postpone its verification of the claimant\u2019s entitlement to a later date. If the Commission seeks verification after the benefits were paid and the Commission finds that the claimant has not proven their availability for work, then the Commission has the discretion to decide under section 52 of the EIA whether it is going to reconsider the claim. It further held that, in doing so, the Commission is required to exercise its discretion judicially (AD Decision at paras. 67, 75-76).\n[10] Nonetheless, the Appeal Division found that the General Division erred in law when it assessed the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion. It found that the General Division should have considered the relevance of section 153.161 of the EIA to that decision, instead of focusing solely on the absence of new facts justifying the Commission changing its initial entitlement decisions.\n[11] The Appeal Division determined that the appropriate remedy was to substitute its decision on the issue of whether the Commission had exercised its discretion judicially. The Appeal Division divided the claim into two periods.\n[12] First, it decided that the Commission did not exercise its discretion judicially for the period between September 28, 2020 and December 15, 2020. The Commission had already verified Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 entitlement to benefits when it had a conversation with her about her training on October 27, 2020. When the Commission decided that she was entitled to benefits, it was satisfied that Ms. T-Giorgis had proven her availability. The Appeal Division found that the factors in the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy applied and the claim should not be reconsidered for that period (AD Decision at paras. 146-165).\n[13] The Appeal Division then considered the period between December 16, 2020 and September 4, 2021. It found that the Commission had exercised its discretion in a judicial manner since it did not verify entitlement until January 11, 2022 (AD Decision at paras. 129, 166-167). Despite substituting its decision on the issue of discretion, the Appeal Division found that it could not make a final decision on whether Ms. T-Giorgis was available for work during this period and decided to return the issue to the General Division.\n[14] Before this Court, Ms. T-Giorgis raises four grounds on which she asserts that the decision of the Appeal Division is unreasonable. Albeit in a different order, she argues first that the Appeal Division unreasonably concluded that the Commission\u2019s decision to reconsider her claim engages section 153.161 of the EIA. Second, she argues that the Appeal Division misconstrued the term \u201cverify\u201d in subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA as allowing the Commission to retroactively change a decision even if the verification reveals no new information. Third, she submits that the Appeal Division should have applied the Commission\u2019s policy to the reconsideration of the claim from December 16, 2020 and September 4, 2021. Finally, Ms. T-Giorgis challenges the Appeal Division\u2019s conclusion that the Commission exercised its discretion judicially for the weeks between December 16, 2020 and September 4, 2021. She does not take issue with the Commission\u2019s decision to stop benefits after September 4, 2021.\nII. Analysis A. Standard of Review [15] The parties agree that the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is reviewable on the deferential standard of reasonableness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65; Page v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 169 at para. 48; Canada (Attorney General) v. Hull, 2022 FCA 82 at paras. 12-13; Hillier v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 44 at para. 12).\n[16] When the standard of reasonableness applies, the Court\u2019s focus is on \u201cwhether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision\u201d (Vavilov at para. 99). It must be internally coherent, and display a rational chain of analysis (Vavilov at para. 85). The burden is on the party challenging the decision to show that it is unreasonable and the Court \u201cmust be satisfied that any shortcomings or flaws relied on \u2026 are sufficiently central or significant to render the decision unreasonable\u201d (Vavilov at para. 100).\n[17] One of the relevant constraints is subsection 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act, S.C. 2005, c. 34 (DESDA). It specifies that the Appeal Division can only intervene if the General Division (a) failed to observe a principle of natural justice or otherwise acted beyond or refused to exercise its jurisdiction; (b) erred in law in making its decision, whether or not the error appears on the face of the record; or (c) based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it. Paragraph 58(1)(c) of the DESDA does not allow the Appeal Division to overturn a decision of the General Division on the basis that it would have weighed the evidence differently (Sibbald v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 157 at para. 27; Uvaliyev v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 222 at para. 7).\n[18] Once the Appeal Division finds there is a legitimate reason to intervene, it may proceed to decide questions of fact that are necessary for the disposition of the appeal (Nelson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 222 at para. 17) and give the decision the General Division should have given or, as it did in this case, refer the matter back for reconsideration in accordance with any directions it considers appropriate (DESDA, subsection 59(1)).\nB. Relevant Framework [19] At the outset, it is useful to set out the statutory and policy framework relevant to this application.\n[20] Employment insurance benefits are payable to claimants who meet the statutory requirements. To receive benefits, claimants must first qualify to receive benefits. They must demonstrate that they have suffered an interruption of earnings from employment and that they have had a minimum number of hours of insurable employment in a period preceding the claim (EIA, sections 7, 8).\n[21] Claimants must also not be disentitled to receive benefits. Pursuant to paragraph 18(1)(a) of the EIA, a claimant is not entitled to benefits if the claimant fails to prove that they were capable of and available for work and unable to obtain suitable employment.\n[22] Under paragraph 25(1)(a) of the EIA, as it now reads and as it read at the relevant time, a claimant is considered unemployed and capable of and available for work during a period when they are attending a course of instruction or training program to which they were referred by the Commission or a designated authority. In other words, a claimant who is referred by the Commission does not need to prove availability.\n[23] Section 153.161 of the EIA was added to the EIA on September 27, 2020, by Interim Order No. 10 Amending the Employment Insurance Act (Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit), Canada Gazette, Part II, Vol. 154, No. 21, S.O.R.\/2020-208. The Explanatory Note to Interim Order No. 10 provides among other things that the interim order enables a modified operational approach to the assessment of availability to work for claimants in training. It also specifies that the provisions made under the interim order will cease to have effect on September 25, 2021.\n[24] Section 153.161 of the EIA reads as follows:\nAvailability\nDisponibilit\u00e9\nCourse, program of instruction or non-referred training\nCours ou programme d\u2019instruction ou de formation non dirig\u00e9\n153.161 (1) For the purposes of applying paragraph 18(1)(a), a claimant who attends a course, program of instruction or training to which the claimant is not referred under paragraphs 25(1)(a) or (b) is not entitled to be paid benefits for any working day in a benefit period for which the claimant is unable to prove that on that day they were capable of and available for work.\n153.161 (1) Pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 18(1)a), le prestataire qui suit un cours ou programme d\u2019instruction ou de formation pour lequel il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux alin\u00e9as 25(1)a) ou b) n\u2019est pas admissible au versement des prestations pour tout jour ouvrable d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de prestations pour lequel il ne peut prouver qu\u2019il \u00e9tait, ce jour-l\u00e0, capable de travailler et disponible \u00e0 cette fin.\nVerification\nV\u00e9rification\n(2) The Commission may, at any point after benefits are paid to a claimant, verify that the claimant referred to in subsection (1) is entitled to those benefits by requiring proof that they were capable of and available for work on any working day of their benefit period.\n(2) La Commission peut v\u00e9rifier, \u00e0 tout moment apr\u00e8s le versement des prestations, que le prestataire vis\u00e9 au paragraphe (1) est admissible aux prestations en exigeant la preuve qu\u2019il \u00e9tait capable de travailler et disponible \u00e0 cette fin pour tout jour ouvrable de sa p\u00e9riode de prestations.\n[25] Subsection 52(1) of the EIA provides that the Commission may reconsider a claim for benefits within 36 months after benefits have been paid or would have been payable. If the Commission decides that a person has received money by way of benefits for which the person was not qualified or to which the person was not entitled, the Commission may seek repayment of the monies overpaid under subsections 52(2) and 52(3) of the EIA.\n[26] The Commission\u2019s Digest of Benefit Entitlement Principles also contains a number of principles that the Commission applies, including when it makes decisions relating to availability and the reconsideration of claims. Sections 10.12.2, 17.3.2.2, 17.3.3 and 17.3.3.2 are relevant to this application.\n[27] Section 10.12.2 of the Digest, found in Chapter 10 \u2013 Availability, is directed at persons attending courses on their own initiative. It provides that, before rendering a decision regarding the availability of a claimant who is attending a course on their own initiative, the agent of the Commission will consider whether the claimant could be referred to a similar course, pursuant to subsection 25(1) of the EIA. If so, and a referral is made, the claimant will not be required to show that they were unemployed, capable of, and available for work. If not, the agent will document the file by indicating that the option was reviewed and the reasons it is not available. The agent will then make a determination as to the claimant\u2019s availability for work while taking the course.\n[28] Chapter 17 of the Digest addresses among other things, error correction and reconsideration. Section 17.3.2.2 states that a Commission error will occur when the Commission has all the relevant information needed to make a decision, but the information does not support the final decision. If the benefits were incorrectly paid, the Commission will correct the error currently and no overpayment will be created. However, if the error resulted in a decision that is contrary to the structure of the EIA, the Commission will correct the error retroactively and an overpayment will occur.\n[29] Additionally, section 17.3.3, entitled \u201cReconsideration policy\u201d, provides that the Commission has developed a policy to ensure a consistent and fair application of section 52 of the EIA and to prevent creating debt when a claimant was overpaid through no fault of their own. It further states that a claim will only be reconsidered when (1) benefits have been underpaid, (2) benefits were paid contrary to the structure of the EIA, (3) benefits were paid as a result of a false or misleading statement, and (4) the claimant ought to have known there was no entitlement to the benefits received. Section 17.3.3.2 specifies that decisions on availability are not decisions that run contrary to the structure of the EIA.\nC. Application of Section 153.161 of the EIA [30] Ms. T-Giorgis submits that the Appeal Division unreasonably concluded that the Commission\u2019s decision to reconsider her claim engages section 153.161 of the EIA. In her view, subsection 153.161(2) does not apply to her claim because the Commission had approved her training. As a result, under section 10.12.2 of the Digest, she did not have to prove her availability.\n[31] This argument cannot succeed because the record does not establish that the Commission, or a delegated authority, either referred her for training under subsection 25(1) of the EIA or made a referral under section 10.12.2 of the Digest.\n[32] The supplementary record of claim relating to the October 27, 2020 telephone conversation demonstrates that, while Ms. T-Giorgis discussed her training with the agent for the period between September 9, 2020 and December 15, 2020, the agent identified availability as the main issue for discussion. There is no indication that the agent approved her training and made a referral as articulated in section 10.12.2 of the Digest. To the contrary, the supplementary record of claim reports that the Commission advised Ms. T-Giorgis of a decision, of its impact on the claim and of her right to file a formal request for reconsideration and of the applicable time frame. Although the nature of the decision is not explicitly stated, I fail to see why the Commission would have informed Ms. T-Giorgis of her right to file a request for reconsideration if it had referred her for training. I find it is more likely that the Commission found Ms. T-Giorgis to be available for work despite her training, but only for the period until December 15, 2020 (Applicant\u2019s record at 263). This is supported by the fact that decisions regarding referral are not reviewable, as per subsection 25(2) of the EIA, while decisions regarding availability are reviewable.\n[33] Ms. T-Giorgis also claims the automated messages she received after submitting her biweekly reports demonstrate that her training was approved. She relies in particular on the automated messages from her February and May 2021 biweekly reports, in which the Commission mentions that it has \u201callowed\u201d her training period (Applicant\u2019s record at 334, 402).\n[34] Ms. T-Giorgis is misconstruing the automated messages. They do not say that her training has been approved such that it is captured by subsection 25(1) of the EIA or section 10.12.2 of the Digest. On the contrary, they include a warning that proof of her availability may later be requested and could impact her entitlement to benefits for the training period. This statement, in my view, is inconsistent with the presumption of status found in both subsection 25(1) of the EIA and section 10.12.2 of the Digest. If the Commission had indeed made a referral under the section 10.12.2 of the Digest, Ms. T-Giorgis would not have been required to prove her availability.\n[35] I also find that Ms. T-Giorgis is misconstruing paragraph 33 of the General Division\u2019s decision. The General Division\u2019s statement that the Commission allowed the training must be read in the proper context. The General Division was examining the issue of whether the Commission had made initial entitlement decisions to allow the payment of benefits regardless of her training. The General Division found that the Commission had made initial entitlement decisions. However, it also found that the Commission had the authority to go back and verify if Ms. T-Giorgis was available for work within her benefit period.\n[36] To conclude on this point, Ms. T-Giorgis has failed to persuade me that she was referred for training under either subsection 25(1) of the EIA or section 10.12.2 of the Digest. Accordingly, I am satisfied that it was reasonable for the Appeal Division to find that section 153.161 of the EIA applies to Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 circumstances.\nD. Verification of Entitlement After Benefits Paid [37] Ms. T-Giorgis submits that, even if section 153.161 of the EIA is relevant, it does not give the Commission the power to retroactively reconsider her availability absent new information. In her view, the purpose of verification is to confirm or supplement the facts and information upon which the original decision was based. It is not to give the Commission an opportunity to render a second decision based on the same information.\n[38] She argues that subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA was never intended to address some general difficulty in making timely decisions on benefit entitlement during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it only applies to students, a small subset of total claimants. She contends that it was meant to address the fact that most claimants who were automatically transitioned from the EI-ERB were not required to complete an initial application for benefits, which would typically have required them to provide detailed information about their training programs. Without an initial application for benefits, the Commission would not have had the information it would usually have at the start of the claim. Subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA gave the Commission the power to pay benefits and then later obtain any missing information to verify the claim. If new information was uncovered, the Commission could then retroactively reconsider the claim under section 52 of the EIA.\n[39] These arguments do not persuade me that the Appeal Division\u2019s interpretation of section 153.161 is unreasonable.\n[40] The Appeal Division concluded that, together, subsection 153.161(2) and section 52 of the EIA empower the Commission to verify entitlement to benefits paid to students in non-referred training and to assess an overpayment.\n[41] In coming to this conclusion, the Appeal Division first considered the text of subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA. It found that the text of the provision is clear that verification of entitlement can happen after benefits were paid. In its view, verifying entitlement also implies that the Commission has already made a decision (AD Decision at para. 60).\n[42] The Appeal Division further noted that the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA means that the authority to verify is discretionary. It found that this discretion is inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s position that this provision allows the making of a delayed entitlement decision. The Appeal Division observed that, if the Commission were to not exercise its discretion to verify the claim under subsection 153.161(2), this would mean the Commission would never make any decision regarding benefit entitlement (AD Decision at para. 61).\n[43] The Appeal Division then considered section 153.161 in the context of section 52 of the EIA. It noted that subsection 52(2) gives the Commission the discretion to reconsider a claim after benefits have been paid and to assess an overpayment when a person has received benefits for which they were not qualified or to which they were not entitled. The Appeal Division found that, if section 153.161 was interpreted as permitting a delayed entitlement decision, there would be no corresponding mechanism allowing the Commission to assess and recover the overpayment.\n[44] Given the text of section 153.161 and the context of section 52, the Appeal Division found that section 153.161 allows the Commission to make an initial entitlement decision based on the statements made by a claimant in their application for benefits and their biweekly reports, but to delay its verification of their availability for work to a later date (AD Decision at paras. 66-67).\n[45] The Appeal Division next considered the purpose of section 153.161 of the EIA. It found that its interpretation is consistent with the modified operational approach mentioned in the Explanatory Note to Interim Order 10. Given the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic, the legislature recognized that it was not always possible for the Commission to verify entitlement at the time of initial application.\n[46] The Appeal Division concluded that the Commission has the discretionary authority to seek verification of entitlement after benefits were paid under subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA. If that verification is sought and the Commission decides a claimant has not proven their availability for work, the Commission then has the discretion to decide under section 52 whether it is going to reconsider the claim. In both cases, the Commission must exercise its discretion judicially (AD Decision at para. 75).\n[47] The Appeal Division rejected Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 argument that new facts were needed for the Commission to change its initial entitlement decisions. The Appeal Division accepted that it was relevant that Ms. T-Giorgis was honest in her declaration. However, it noted that section 153.161 of the EIA does not refer to verification of the accuracy of the information provided by the claimant, but to verification of entitlement. The provision specifically contemplates the possibility that the Commission would reconsider claims for students in non-referred training after the payment of benefits, even if they had provided accurate information (AD Decision at paras. 169-170).\n[48] I am satisfied that the Appeal Division\u2019s interpretation of section 153.161 is reasonable in light of the text, context and purpose of the provision.\n[49] Section 153.161 of the EIA was in effect during the period in which Ms. T-Giorgis received benefits and is therefore relevant to her claim. The text of section 153.161 is clear. A claimant who attends non-referred training is not entitled to be paid benefits for any working day of their benefit period if they are unable to prove that on that day they were capable of and available for work. Also, the Commission may, at any point after benefits are paid to a claimant, verify that the claimant is entitled to those benefits by requiring proof they were capable of and available for work on any working day of their benefit period. In other words, verification of entitlement may occur after benefits have been paid.\n[50] Moreover, unlike section 111 of the EIA, which grants the Commission the authority to rescind or amend a decision given in any particular claim if new facts are presented or the decision was given in the absence of or based on a mistake as to a material fact, neither subsection 153.161(2) nor section 52 of the EIA require the existence of new information for the Commission to exercise its discretionary authority. Where new facts are required for a tribunal to reconsider, rescind or amend a previous decision, Parliament usually says so (see, e.g., EIA, sections 41, 65.1(4)).\n[51] I acknowledge the wording in the Explanatory Note to Interim Order No. 10, which specifies that the interim order provides authorities related to the transition from the EI-ERB to regular benefits. However, section 153.161 of the EIA was added to Part VIII.5 of the EIA. This part is entitled \u201cTemporary Measures to Facilitate Access to Benefits\u201d. It is reasonable to conclude that the purpose of section 153.161 of the EIA was to expedite benefit delivery to claimants who were students or receiving training by postponing verification of entitlement until after the payment of benefits, regardless of their transition to regular benefits. Prior to the implementation of section 153.161, applications for benefits would have normally involved assessing entitlement prior to the payment of benefits.\n[52] While there may be other available interpretations, including the one advanced by Ms. T-Giorgis, I find that the Appeal Division\u2019s interpretation is reasonable and does not warrant intervention by this Court.\nE. Application of the Commission\u2019s Reconsideration Policy [53] Ms. T-Giorgis submits that it was unreasonable for the Appeal Division to conclude that reconsideration of the claim occurred under section 52, but then to also conclude that the very policy governing reconsiderations under section 52 does not apply. She submits that the reconsideration policy should apply to all weeks and not just to the period before December 16, 2020.\n[54] I find that Ms. T-Giorgis is unduly isolating a portion of the Appeal Division\u2019s conclusion regarding the application of section 52 of the EIA. As noted earlier, the Appeal Division found that sections l53.161 and 52 of the EIA have to be read together. Together, they give the Commission the discretionary authority to seek verification of entitlement after the payment of benefits and to assess an overpayment, if appropriate.\n[55] The Appeal Division concluded that the reconsideration provisions in the Digest are not applicable to the verification of entitlement under subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA. It noted that the Commission\u2019s policy was developed prior to the addition of section 153.161 to the EIA and does not provide guidance on how section 153.161 should inform the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion under section 52 of the EIA (AD Decision at para. 118). It also considered the extraordinary circumstances under which section 153.161 was added to the EIA. The Appeal Division reasoned that Parliament therefore specifically contemplated the possibility of the Commission reconsidering claims for students in non-referred training where verification is sought and the student cannot prove their entitlement (AD Decision at paras. 118-121, 160-161). The Appeal Division determined that the policy was relevant for the period from September 28, 2020 to December 15, 2020 because the Commission had verified Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 entitlement. It was not relevant for the following period because verification of entitlement did not occur until January 2022.\n[56] I have not been persuaded that the Appeal Division made a reviewable error in finding that the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy does not apply to Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 circumstances after December 15, 2020. When the Commission verified her entitlement in January 2022, it did so pursuant to subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA. The Commission determined that she was not entitled to benefits because she had not proven her availability for work while attending non-referred training. The Commission then exercised its discretion to reconsider the claim under section 52 of the EIA and assessed the overpayment. The Commission\u2019s authority was exercised under the joint application of subsection 153.161(2) and section 52 of the EIA.\n[57] This is different from the Commission\u2019s decision to reconsider entitlement for the period before December 16, 2020. The Commission had already verified Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 availability and decided that she was entitled to receive benefits. When it decided to assess an overpayment for this period, the Commission derived its authority to reconsider the claim from section 52 only, as it had already verified Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 entitlement to the benefits.\n[58] Given the Appeal Division\u2019s finding that the Commission was exercising its authority to verify entitlement and reconsider the claim under the joint application of subsection 153.161(2) and section 52 of the EIA, I am satisfied that it was reasonable for the Appeal Division to conclude that the reconsideration policy does not apply. In giving the Commission the authority to verify entitlement after the payment of benefits, Parliament had to have in mind the possibility of assessing and recovering overpayments where claimants were not entitled to receive benefits. If the reconsideration policy applied, I fail to see under what circumstances the Commission would exercise its discretion to verify entitlement since decisions on non-availability do not run contrary to the structure of the EIA and argue against reconsideration.\n[59] Moreover, the Digest is an administrative document that outlines different scenarios in which the Commission should reconsider a claim and is meant to ensure consistency in decisions and to avoid arbitrary decisions. While the Digest is an important tool to the Commission, it is not binding. Given the unique context in which section 153.161 was adopted, its purpose and the period during which it was in effect, the Appeal Division could reasonably find that the reconsideration policy does not apply.\nF. Judicial Exercise of Discretion [60] Ms. T-Giorgis challenges the Appeal Division\u2019s conclusion that the Commission exercised its discretion judicially for the weeks between December 16, 2020 and September 4, 2021. First, she argues that the Appeal Division\u2019s reasoning is circular, because a decision about whether to exercise discretion to retroactively reconsider a claim cannot be dictated by what the result would be if the claim was reconsidered. Second, she claims that it was inconsistent for the Appeal Division to conclude that the Commission had judicially exercised a discretion when it did not know it was exercising a discretion. Third, she argues that it was unreasonable for the Commission to approve her schooling for the fall 2020 semester and then revoke approval for subsequent semesters when there was no change in circumstances.\n[61] These arguments do not persuade me that the Appeal Division\u2019s conclusion on the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion is unreasonable.\n[62] The Appeal Division found that the Commission exercised its discretion judicially when it verified Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 entitlement in January 2022 and decided that Ms. T-Giorgis had not proven her availability for work. The Appeal Division also found that the Commission had considered all relevant information in deciding whether to reconsider the claim, including that Ms. T-Giorgis had been honest in her declarations, and that there was no evidence that the Commission had considered irrelevant information, acted in bad faith, or acted in a discriminatory manner (AD Decision at paras. 168, 173).\n[63] There is no basis for Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 argument that the result of a potential reconsideration cannot be part of deciding whether to exercise discretion to retroactively reconsider a claim. Reconsideration of a claim when entitlement is in question is a proper purpose, provided it is done within the time frame imposed under the EIA.\n[64] Likewise, the fact that the Commission does not expressly designate its analysis as an exercise of discretion does not change the fact that the analysis addresses what a discretionary analysis would address.\n[65] Finally, it is not unreasonable for the Commission to approve only one semester of a multi-semester degree since the determination of a claimant\u2019s availability for work requires a contextualized consideration of a claimant\u2019s circumstances (Page at paras. 69, 74).\n[66] I am satisfied that the Appeal Division\u2019s approach in determining whether the Commission exercised its discretion in a judicial manner is reasonable. Ms. T-Giorgis has failed to establish any reviewable error in the Appeal Division\u2019s conclusion on this issue.\n[67] At the hearing, Ms. T-Giorgis argued that the Commission overlooked certain relevant factors in the exercise of its discretion to reconsider the claim, including that the Commission\u2019s delay in addressing the situation had put her in a difficult situation and had created a large debt causing her hardship in having to repay the overpayment. This argument was not raised by Ms. T-Giorgis in her memorandum of fact and law and does not appear to have been raised before the Appeal Division. As a result, it would be inappropriate for this Court to entertain this argument (Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. Alberta Teachers\u2019 Association, 2011 SCC 61 at para. 23).\n[68] That said, in Molchan v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 46, rendered concurrently with this decision, I discuss the relevance of a similar argument. I find that the Appeal Division could reasonably find that financial hardship is meant to be considered in the context of a write-off under subparagraph 56(1)(f)(ii) of the Employment Insurance Regulations, which explicitly provides the Commission with the authority to write off an amount payable under section 43 of the EIA if repayment of the amount due would result in undue hardship to the claimant (Molchan at paras. 40-55). Section 43 of the EIA provides that a claimant is liable to repay an amount paid by the Commission to the claimant as benefits to which the claimant is not entitled. Therefore, Ms. T-Giorgis may ask the Commission for a write-off on the basis of financial hardship and it will be for the Commission to decide if relief is appropriate.\nIII. Conclusion [69] To conclude, despite her counsel\u2019s able submissions, Ms. T-Giorgis has failed to persuade me that the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is unreasonable. While she may not agree with the outcome, the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and is justified in relation to the facts and the law it was required to apply in the circumstances (Vavilov at para. 85). Although I am sympathetic to Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 unfortunate situation, I am unable to find any basis upon which to intervene.\n[70] The Appeal Division\u2019s disposition was to send the matter back to the General Division. The General Division will reassess its findings on availability for the period between December 16, 2020 and September 4, 2021, and in doing so, should consider this Court\u2019s recent decision in Page.\n[71] For these reasons, I would dismiss the application for judicial review. The respondent did not seek costs and none will be awarded.\n\"Sylvie E. Roussel\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nDavid Stratas J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nJohn B.

Overview [1] The applicant, Mr. Puig, seeks judicial review of a decision of the Appeal Division of the Social Security Tribunal dated February 22, 2023 (2023 SST 192).\n[2] In September 2020, Mr. Puig resided in Canada as an international student registered in a one-year program. Following the advice of Service Canada agents, Mr. Puig applied for regular employment insurance (EI) benefits on October 7, 2020 after his previous employment was terminated. His application for benefits stated that he was a student and provided information about his program, including the fact that it was a full-time course, the number of days he was required to attend classes and the number of hours he spent in class. It also stated that he had not previously worked while taking a course or program (Applicant\u2019s record at 58-66).\n[3] Mr. Puig also provided copies of his previous work permit valid from June 2019 to June 2020 and of his study and work permits valid from June 2020 to November 2021. His study permit allowed him to work up to 20 hours per week while in school and his work permit was restricted to working for his school in the second phase of his training (Applicant\u2019s record at 67-73). His application was approved, and Mr. Puig collected EI benefits from October 5, 2020 to February 26, 2021.\n[4] On March 16 and 17, 2021, a Commission agent called Mr. Puig to discuss his studies and his entitlement to benefits. He was notified both verbally and in writing that he was disentitled from benefits from October 5, 2020 to February 26, 2021 for non-availability for work given the restrictions on his study permit, thereby creating an overpayment (Applicant\u2019s record at 74-78). Mr. Puig sought reconsideration, but the Commission upheld its decision (Applicant\u2019s record at 83-84).\n[5] Mr. Puig appealed the Commission\u2019s decision to the General Division of the Social Security Tribunal. In its decision (2021 SST 792), the General Division found that Mr. Puig wanted to work and that he had made reasonable efforts to find employment, but that his study permit and course schedule unduly affected his chances of returning to the labour market. It concluded that, except for the period from December 25, 2020 to January 3, 2021, Mr. Puig was not available for work until March 1, 2021 (Applicant\u2019s record at 145-155). The General Division expressed concern about how the Commission had handled the claim, but determined that it did not have the power to assist Mr. Puig. Dissatisfied, Mr. Puig appealed the decision to the Appeal Division.\n[6] The Appeal Division allowed the appeal and returned the matter to the General Division for reconsideration after finding that the General Division had not addressed the question of whether the Commission had the power to retroactively disentitle Mr. Puig and, if so, whether the Commission had acted judicially in doing so. On appeal, Mr. Puig did not dispute the General Division\u2019s decision on the issue of availability (GP v. Canada Employment Insurance Commission, 2021 SST 791 at para. 12).\n[7] In July 2022, the General Division concluded that section 153.161 of the Employment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996, c. 23 (EIA) gives the Commission the authority to disentitle Mr. Puig after benefits were paid (2022 SST 872). It accepted the Commission\u2019s argument that benefits were paid on the basis of qualification and that first-time entitlement decisions were made after benefits were paid. The General Division also concluded that the Commission had exercised its discretion judicially. It held that, even though Mr. Puig provided the Commission true and accurate information from the time he applied for benefits, once the Commission undertook to verify his entitlement to EI benefits, Mr. Puig had to prove he was capable of and available for work. The General Division found that the Commission had considered relevant factors to make its decision on availability, including details of his studies, the efforts he made to find work, and any limitations to working. It concluded that, except for the period between December 25, 2020 and January 3, 2021 and after March 1, 2021, Mr. Puig had not demonstrated his availability for work. Mr. Puig appealed a second time to the Appeal Division.\n[8] On February 22, 2023, the Appeal Division found that the General Division had misinterpreted section 153.161 of the EIA when it concluded that the provision allows for a delayed entitlement decision. It found that section 153.161 gives the Commission the discretionary authority to seek verification of entitlement after an initial entitlement decision has already been made, based on statements made in the claimant\u2019s application and ongoing reports, and after benefits were paid (AD Decision at paras. 70-71, 81, 89). If verification is sought and the Commission determines that the claimant has not demonstrated their availability for work, the Commission then has the discretion to decide, under subsection 52(1) of the EIA, whether it is going to reconsider the claim. In doing so, it must exercise its discretion judicially (AD Decision at paras. 78, 88-89).\n[9] The Appeal Division then considered whether the Commission had exercised its discretion judicially when it decided to verify Mr. Puig\u2019s entitlement and to reconsider his claim.\n[10] The Appeal Division first noted that there was no evidence that the Commission had acted in bad faith, considered irrelevant factors or ignored relevant ones, or acted in a discriminatory manner when it decided to verify Mr. Puig\u2019s entitlement to benefits. The Commission had not previously verified his availability for work and acted on relevant information that called into question his availability, namely that he was attending non-referred training (AD Decision at para. 102).\n[11] The Appeal Division then considered the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion under section 52 of the EIA, including Mr. Puig\u2019s submissions that the Commission could not retroactively reconsider a decision about availability without new facts or information and that the Commission had ignored other relevant factors. Despite noting that Mr. Puig had honestly reported his attendance in school throughout his claim period and that his debt was created through no fault of his own, the Appeal Division held that the Commission was not bound to apply its reconsideration policy given the particular circumstances under which section 153.161 was adopted (AD Decision at paras. 107-113). The Appeal Division further noted that there was no evidence demonstrating that the Commission had acted in bad faith or for an improper purpose, adding that claimants are obligated to repay benefits to which they are not entitled. The Appeal Division indicated that reconsidering a claim where it appears that a claimant may not be entitled to benefits is a proper purpose for reconsideration. The Appeal Division concluded that the Commission had exercised its discretion judicially as it had considered all the relevant information in deciding to reconsider the claim. While sympathetic to Mr. Puig\u2019s situation, the Appeal Division dismissed the appeal.\n[12] Before this Court, Mr. Puig submits that the Appeal Division unreasonably concluded that the Commission could retroactively reconsider his claim. In particular, he first challenges the Appeal Division\u2019s conclusion that the Commission does not have to follow its own reconsideration policy. Second, he argues that the Appeal Division erred in concluding that the word \u201cverify\u201d in subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA allows the Commission to retroactively reconsider his claim in the absence of any new information. Finally, he claims that the Appeal Division erred in finding that the Commission had not already verified his claim by interviewing him in October 2020, five months before imposing the overpayment.\n[13] Mr. Puig further submits, in the alternative, that the Commission did not judicially exercise its discretion in retroactively reconsidering the claim.\nII. Analysis [14] It is important to state at the outset that the present application for judicial review was heard at the same time as two other applications raising substantially similar issues (T-Giorgis v. Canada (Attorney General of Canada), 2024 FCA 47 and Molchan v. Canada (Attorney General of Canada), 2024 FCA 46). The same panel of judges heard the three applications on the same day and the same counsel represented the applicants and the Attorney General of Canada. The reasons in T-Giorgis and Molchan are being issued concurrently with these reasons. Where appropriate, I will rely on those reasons.\nA. Standard of Review [15] The parties agree that the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is reviewable on the deferential standard of reasonableness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65; T-Giorgis at para. 15; Molchan at para. 10; Page v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 169 at para. 48; Canada (Attorney General) v. Hull, 2022 FCA 82 at paras. 12-13; Hillier v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 44 at para. 12).\n[16] The framework for determining whether a decision of the Appeal Division is reasonable is set out in T-Giorgis at paragraphs 16-18 and in Molchan at paragraphs 11-13. Generally speaking, a reasonable decision is \u201cone that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker\u201d (Vavilov at para. 85).\nB. Relevant Framework [17] For the purposes of this application, it is not necessary to provide a full account of the relevant statutory and policy framework, as it is well set out in T-Giorgis at paragraphs 20-29.\nC. Reconsideration of Mr. Puig\u2019s Claim (1) Application of the Commission\u2019s Reconsideration Policy [18] Mr. Puig submits that it is unreasonable to find that reconsideration occurred under section 52 of the EIA and then conclude that the policy on reconsideration does not apply. He adds that the underlying purpose of the reconsideration policy is to prevent creating debt when the claimant has been overpaid through no fault of their own. He contends that his situation should be distinguished from the situation of claimants who were automatically transitioned from EI-ERB to regular EI benefits since the Commission had all the relevant information from the beginning of his application.\n[19] I do not find this argument persuasive.\n[20] The Appeal Division acknowledged that none of the factors in the Commission\u2019s policy justified reconsideration of Mr. Puig\u2019s claim. It noted that Mr. Puig had honestly reported his schooling throughout his claim and that the debt was created through no fault of his own. The Appeal Division observed, however, that the reconsideration policy was developed prior to the addition of section 153.161 to the EIA and does not provide any guidance on how section 153.161 should inform the Commission\u2019s discretion under section 52 of the EIA (AD Decision at paras. 108, 110). Noting that subsection 153.161(2) does not refer to verifying the accuracy of information, but refers rather to entitlement, the Appeal Division opined that the legislature specifically contemplated the possibility of the Commission reconsidering claims for students in non-referred training, even if accurate information was previously provided, in circumstances where verification is sought and the claimant cannot prove their entitlement. The Appeal Division concluded that the Commission was not obligated to apply the reconsideration policy where section 153.161 of the EIA was in play (AD Decision at paras. 112-113).\n[21] For reasons substantially similar to those set out in T-Giorgis at paragraphs 53 to 59, I have not been persuaded that the conclusion of the Appeal Division is unreasonable.\n(2) Absence of New Information [22] Mr. Puig argues that section 153.161 of the EIA does not give the Commission the power to retroactively reconsider a claimant\u2019s availability absent new information. He contends that the purpose of verification is to confirm or supplement the facts and information upon which the original decision was based, not to render a second decision based on the exact same information that was originally provided.\n[23] I disagree.\n[24] The Appeal Division considered the text of section 153.161 of the EIA, the context in which it was adopted, and its purpose. As in T-Giorgis, the Appeal Division found that section 153.161 of the EIA allows the Commission to make an initial entitlement decision based on statements made by a claimant in the application for benefits and the ongoing claimant reports, but to postpone its verification of entitlement to a later date. It further found that the Commission has the discretionary authority under subsection 153.161(2) to seek verification of entitlement after benefits were paid. If verification is sought and the Commission decides that the claimant has not proven their availability, the Commission then has the discretion under section 52 of the EIA to determine whether it is going to reconsider the claim (AD Decision at paras. 71-90).\n[25] The Appeal Division noted that section 153.161 does not refer to verification of the accuracy of information, but rather to verification of entitlement. This means, in the Appeal Division\u2019s view, that Parliament had specifically contemplated the possibility of the Commission reconsidering claims for students in non-referred training after benefits were paid, even if the claimant had provided accurate information (AD Decision at paras. 111-112).\n[26] A comparable argument was raised and dismissed in T-Giorgis at paragraphs 37 to 52. I see no reason to depart from those findings.\n(3) The October 2020 Call [27] Mr. Puig submits that the Commission had already verified his claim in October 2020. He argues that an agent of Service Canada reviewed the file, called him and interviewed him at length. In his view, it would be unreasonable to suggest that the Commission reviewed his application, conducted a full investigation regarding his reasons for separation, but then failed to turn its mind to the issue of training.\n[28] The Appeal Division found that there was no evidence of any discussion in that conversation regarding Mr. Puig\u2019s availability for work or that his availability had been verified in that conversation (AD Decision at paras. 106, 117).\n[29] The burden of demonstrating that a decision is unreasonable is on the party challenging the decision (Vavilov at para. 100). Mr. Puig has not pointed to any evidence that would demonstrate that the Appeal Division\u2019s finding is unreasonable.\nD. Judicial Exercise of Discretion [30] Mr. Puig submits, in the alternative, that the Commission did not exercise its discretion to retroactively reconsider the claim judicially. First, he contends that the Appeal Division unreasonably concluded that the Commission exercised its discretion judicially despite finding that the law had worked a real hardship in his case. Second, he argues that the Appeal Division erred in finding that the Commission had turned its mind to the relevant factors despite maintaining throughout that it was not even exercising a discretion to reconsider. Third, he maintains that the Appeal Division unreasonably concluded that both the misinformation Mr. Puig received from Service Canada and the Commission's delay in acting on information already in its possession are irrelevant to the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion.\n[31] Regarding Mr. Puig\u2019s first argument, I agree that EI benefits are meant to protect workers from hardship when they experience involuntary loss of employment. However, I do not find that it was inconsistent for the Appeal Division to find that the law has worked a real hardship in this case and to also find that the Commission exercised its discretion judicially. The Appeal Division\u2019s statement on hardship must be interpreted in its proper context.\n[32] In examining whether the Commission exercised its discretion judicially, the Commission considered Mr. Puig\u2019s arguments that he had spoken to Service Canada agents, that he understood that he could apply for benefits and that he had been approved, that he had provided all relevant information in his application, and that the Commission waited several months before acting on the information in its possession. The Appeal Division nonetheless found that there was no evidence demonstrating that the Commission had acted in bad faith, or for an improper purpose. The Appeal Division also noted that the Commission had considered all relevant information in deciding to reconsider the claim and concluded that, since the Commission had exercised its discretion judicially, it could not intervene in that decision (AD Decision at paras. 106, 109, 114-121).\n[33] The Appeal Division then recognized that Mr. Puig would be disappointed with the result, and commented on the question of hardship. It observed that \u201c[u]nfortunately, the law has worked a real hardship in [Mr. Puig\u2019s] case\u2026 [as he] acted honestly throughout yet is now left with a substantial debt\u201d (AD Decision at para. 122). While sympathetic to Mr. Puig\u2019s situation, the Appeal Division noted that it could not provide him with a remedy (AD Decision at para. 123).\n[34] In Molchan at paragraphs 40-55, I examine whether the Commission was bound to consider financial hardship in the exercise of its discretion under section 52 of the EIA. While the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion in that case was guided by the reconsideration policy, I find in Molchan that the Appeal Division\u2019s comments regarding the claimant\u2019s ability to seek a write-off of her debt are consistent with the legislation, which sets out a specific procedure for undue hardship cases. Subparagraph 56(1)(f)(ii) of the Employment Insurance Regulations, S.O.R.\/96-332 gives the Commission broad powers to write off an amount payable under section 43 of the EIA if the repayment of the amount due would result in undue hardship to the claimant. Section 43 provides that a claimant is liable to repay an amount paid by the Commission as benefits and to which the claimant was not entitled.\n[35] Consequently, as the Appeal Division noted, the authority to overwrite a debt does not lie with either the General Division or the Appeal Division. That said, Mr. Puig is not left without relief. He may ask the Commission for a write-off on the basis of financial hardship and it will be for the Commission to decide if relief is appropriate.\n[36] Regarding Mr. Puig\u2019s second argument, that the Commission could not exercise its discretion judicially if it did not know it was doing so, I am not persuaded that the Appeal Division committed a reviewable error. It is not inconsistent for the Appeal Division to conclude that the Commission judicially exercised a discretion that it did not know it was exercising, provided that the underlying discretionary analysis is conducted, even if it is not expressly recognized as an exercise of discretion. The Appeal Division found that there was no evidence that the Commission considered irrelevant factors, ignored relevant ones or acted in bad faith in deciding to verify Mr. Puig\u2019s entitlement to benefits. The Commission had acted on information calling into question Mr. Puig\u2019s availability, as he was attending a program to which he was not referred by the Commission.\n[37] The fact that the Commission does not expressly designate this analysis as an exercise of discretion does not change the fact that this analysis addresses what a discretionary analysis would address. Thus, even if Mr. Puig is correct in stating that the Commission did not know it was exercising its discretion, it remains that he has not demonstrated that the Commission\u2019s conclusion is unreasonable.\n[38] Regarding Mr. Puig\u2019s third argument, this Court found in Canada (Attorney General) v. Buors, 2002 FCA 372 and in Granger v. Canada Employment and Immigration Commission, [1986] 3 F.C. 70, 29 D.L.R. (4th) 501 (F.C.A.) (Granger), later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in Granger v. Canada (Canada Employment and Immigration Commission), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 141, that a claimant cannot rely on misinformation from the Commission or its representatives that is contrary to what is prescribed by law. I dismiss a similar argument in Molchan at paragraphs 37-39. On the issue of the delay to verify the claim, the Commission acted within the time frame imposed under the EIA. Aside from the issue of hardship which I address above, Mr. Puig has not demonstrated why it was unreasonable for the Appeal Division to find that the delay was not a relevant factor to the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion.\nIII. Conclusion [39] To conclude, despite his counsel\u2019s able submissions, Mr. Puig has failed to persuade me that the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is unreasonable. While he may not agree with the outcome, the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and is justified in relation to the facts and the law it was required to apply in the circumstances (Vavilov at para. 85). Although I am sympathetic to Mr. Puig\u2019s unfortunate situation, I am unable to find any basis upon which to intervene.\n[40] On a final note, I wish to point out that no issue was raised before this Court in relation to this Court\u2019s recent decision in Page, which held that full-time students are not systematically disentitled from receiving EI benefits and that a contextual analysis is required to ascertain whether the presumption of non-availability has been rebutted. As no argument was made regarding the basis on which the Commission found that Mr. Puig was unavailable for work, these reasons should not be read as a validation of the Commission\u2019s grounds.\n[41] For these reasons, I would dismiss the application for judicial review. The respondent did not seek costs and none will be awarded.\n\"Sylvie E. Roussel\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nDavid Stratas J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nJohn B.

Canada (Attorney General)\nCourt (s) Database\nFederal Court of Appeal Decisions\nDate\n2024-01-10\nNeutral citation\n2024 FCA 5\nFile numbers\nA-160-23\nDecision Content\nDate: 20240110\nDocket: A-160-23\nCitation: 2024 FCA 5\nCORAM:\nSTRATAS J.A.\nLASKIN J.A.\nGOYETTE J.A.\nBETWEEN:\nR. MAXINE COLLINS\nAppellant\nand\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA\nRespondent\nHeard at Ottawa, Ontario, on January 10, 2024.\nOrder delivered from the Bench at Ottawa, Ontario, on January 10, 2024.\nREASONS FOR ORDER BY:\nTHE COURT\nDate: 20240110\nDocket: A-160-23\nCitation: 2024 FCA 5\nCORAM:\nSTRATAS J.A.\nLASKIN J.A.\nGOYETTE J.A.\nBETWEEN:\nR. MAXINE COLLINS\nAppellant\nand\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR ORDER\n[1] The appellant moves for an order that Stratas J.A. recuse himself from this appeal. She says that Stratas J.A. is biased against her. She relies on various directions, orders and judgments Stratas J.A. has made or concurred with in cases involving her since 2011.\n[2] On this motion, the parties have filed motion records. The parties have also made oral submissions at the outset of the hearing of this appeal. The Court has considered the parties\u2019 submissions and now can rule on the appellant\u2019s recusal motion.\nA. The principles governing a recusal motion [3] The Chief Justice assigns judges of this Court to serve on panels to hear and decide cases. The judges have no input into this decision.\n[4] In this case, consistent with the Court\u2019s standard practice, Stratas J.A. had no input into the Chief Justice\u2019s decision to assign him to this case.\n[5] From time to time, judges receive a list of the cases to which they are assigned. Stratas J.A. learned that he was assigned to this case roughly a month ago. When he was assigned to it, he had no concern about his ability to accept the assignment.\n[6] Once assigned to a matter, a judge cannot refuse the assignment or recuse, absent good legal cause.\n[7] One example of good legal cause is actual bias in favour of or against a side on all or part of the case. A judge with that mental state must recuse forthwith and refrain from being involved in it at all.\n[8] Another legal cause for recusal is if the judge is not actually biased but the circumstances are such that a reasonable, fully informed person, thinking the matter through, would conclude that it is more likely than not that a judge, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide the case fairly: Committee for Justice and Liberty et al. v. National Energy Board et al., [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369 at 394.\n[9] The two tests\u2014one for actual bias, the other for apparent or apprehended bias\u2014give voice to the fundamental principle that \u201cjustice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done\u201d: R. v. Sussex Justices, [1923] EWHC KB 1, [1924] 1 K.B. 256.\n[10] The judge against whom an allegation of actual bias is made, here Stratas J.A., is the only person who can confirm or deny the allegation. Thus, whether acting alone or on a panel, only that judge can decide the issue of actual bias.\n[11] But where, as here, the Court is comprised of three judges on a panel and where the individual judge denies the allegation of actual bias, the appearance may nevertheless be such that the judge must recuse for reasons of fairness and to maintain the reputation of the Court and the public\u2019s confidence in the administration of justice. Due to the broader sweep of apparent or apprehended bias\u2014an institutional rather than an individual concern\u2014all three judges comprising the Court must consider and determine the issue.\n[12] There is a strong presumption that judges will obey their judicial oaths and act impartially. Unwarranted allegations of judicial bias can harm the administration of justice: Es-Sayyid v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2012 FCA 59, [2013] 4 F.C.R. 3. Alleging judicial bias is \u201ca serious step that should not be undertaken lightly\u201d: R. v. S.(R.D.), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484 at para. 133.\n[13] Thus, motions such as this should be brought only where there is a \u201creal likelihood or probability of [actual or apparent] bias\u201d, supported by \u201ccogent evidence\u201d: Yukon Francophone School Board, Education Area #23 v. Yukon (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 25, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 282 at para. 25; Cojocaru v. British Columbia Women\u2019s Hospital and Health Centre, 2013 SCC 30, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 357 at paras. 22 and 27. A wholly unwarranted motion should normally be met with an enhanced award of costs.\nB. Applying the principles to this case (a) Actual bias [14] In this case, Stratas J.A. declares that he is not biased. He has sat on previous cases and motions involving the appellant and has never had nor has he developed an animus against the appellant. As for this appeal, he confirms that he is approaching it with an open, persuadable mind. He has worked hard to understand the evidentiary record and the written submissions filed to date in this appeal. He is and remains committed to reviewing the appellant\u2019s written and oral submissions carefully in light of the facts and the applicable law.\n[15] As well, Stratas J.A. confirms that he has always treated the appellant like any other litigant who appears before him: with due courtesy and fairness, interest in her submissions, and a willingness to listen and consider those submissions. The appellant has not suggested otherwise. Stratas J.A. intends to do likewise in this appeal.\n[16] Thus, Stratas J.A. rejects the appellant\u2019s allegations of actual bias.\n(b) Apparent or apprehended bias [17] As for apparent or apprehended bias, we are all of the view that the appellant\u2019s allegations and submissions have no merit.\n[18] The appellant has referred to a number of motions and appeals involving her on which Stratas J.A. has sat. She alleges that Stratas J.A. has consistently ruled against her in various matters.\n[19] One or more previous rulings by a judge against a litigant\u2014indeed, the overall win-loss record of a litigant before a judge\u2014cannot, by themselves, demonstrate apparent or apprehended bias. A reasonable, fully informed person appreciates that a judge may rule against a party on a number of occasions. And that person also appreciates that a losing streak may be justified by the facts and the law of the individual cases. See Canada (Attorney General) v. Yodjeu, 2019 FCA 178 at para. 15; Oberlander v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 64 at para. 10; Abi-Mansour v. Canada (Passport Canada), 2016 FCA 5 at para. 14; and R. v. Perciballi (2001), 146 O.A.C. 1, 54 O.R. (3d) 346 at para. 21, aff\u2019d 2002 SCC 51 at para. 1.\n[20] Here, we have reviewed the reasons offered in the various matters the appellant raises and the circumstances surrounding them. The reasons offered are not slapdash or rash. Rather, they consistently show a careful, considered and rational approach on the facts and the law.\n[21] But, in any event, the results of the appellant\u2019s matters before Stratas J.A. have not been one-sided. A review of the orders and directions involving the appellant shows that Stratas J.A. has exercised his discretion in the appellant\u2019s favour on some issues.\n[22] There is nothing in the various matters that suggests that there is an appearance or apprehension of animus or bias against the appellant. Although the appellant has not always been successful in matters involving Stratas J.A., the reasons of the Court in each matter show due and careful consideration of the appellant\u2019s submissions and decisions based on a careful and objective application of the law to the facts.\n[23] The appellant focuses on a recent ruling of Stratas J.A. It permitted the respondent to file a book of authorities even though it was late. This ruling cannot be taken to be something that could create an appearance or apprehension of bias. Judges of this Court regularly permit the late filing of authorities in the absence of prejudice. Not permitting a filing like that hurts everyone: it leaves the parties and the Court without a convenient collection of authorities to review.\n[24] The appellant\u2019s main concern is a general one about both Federal Courts. She says that they tend to believe the submissions of lawyers rather than self-represented litigants like her. That is not a ground for Stratas J.A. to recuse. There is no evidence of lack of even-handedness on Stratas J.A.\u2019s part.\n[25] Further, we are all of the view that nothing has been done in this appeal that would create an appearance or apprehension of animus or pre-judgment of the appellant\u2019s case.\nC. Disposition [26] Therefore, we will dismiss the appellant\u2019s recusal motion with costs. Costs shall be on the usual scale since the respondent did not ask for enhanced costs.\n\u201cDavid Stratas\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cJ.B.

In its judgment, the Tax Court dismissed the appellants\u2019 appeals from reassessments made under the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.).\n[2] The appellants were incorporated by Ron Bonin to carry on the business of window and railing manufacturing and installation. Mr. Bonin is the CEO and sole manager of each of the appellants.\n[3] On the advice of their tax advisor, the appellants claimed deductions for management fee expenses. The Tax Court found that there were no written or oral agreements for the provision of management services. It further found that the tax advisor determined the amounts charged each year. These amounts were not based on any measurable factors, but rather on the amount of the paying company\u2019s income. In almost all cases, invoices were issued on the last day of the paying company\u2019s taxation year. The invoices contained no detail as to the services provided or who had provided them. In response to Mr. Bonin\u2019s inquiry of the appellants\u2019 tax advisor concerning the claimed deductions, the tax advisor stated that they were \u201cokay.\u201d\n[4] The appeals to the Tax Court raised three issues: (1) whether the amounts claimed as management fees were deductible in computing income under paragraph 18(1)(a) of the ITA; (2) whether the appellants were liable for gross negligence penalties under subsection 163(2) on the basis that they were wilfully blind or grossly negligent with respect to the false statements in their claims to deduct management fees; and (3) whether reassessments of certain taxation years of some of the appellants, which would otherwise be statute-barred as falling beyond the normal reassessment period, were open to the Minister under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) because those appellants had made misrepresentations attributable to \u201cneglect, carelessness or wilful default.\u201d\n[5] The Tax Court determined that (1) the amounts claimed were not deductible; (2) the appellants were liable for gross negligence penalties; and (3) the Minister had validly opened up the taxation years in question. The appellants submit that the Tax Court erred in law in addressing each of the three issues. We can see no reviewable error.\n[6] In alleging error on the first issue, the appellants submit that the Tax Court failed to consider all the relevant facts, and confined itself to considering only Mr. Bonin\u2019s testimony and certain financial statements. The reasons of the Tax Court do not bear out this submission. The Tax Court also expressly considered, among other things, the absence of contracts for the management services, the invoices on which the appellants relied, and the evidence of a bookkeeper. Moreover, first instance courts are presumed to have considered and assessed all of the evidence before them: Mahjoub v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FCA 157 at paras. 67-69.\n[7] In challenging the decision on the second issue, the appellants acknowledge that the Tax Court recognized the correct test for wilful blindness, but submit that the Court failed to apply it. That test, as the Tax Court stated (at page 13 of its reasons), is subjective in nature, and authorizes the Court to impute knowledge to a taxpayer \u201cin circumstances where the taxpayer becomes aware of the need for inquiry but declines to make the inquiry because the taxpayer does not want to know, or studiously avoids, the truth\u201d: Wynter v. Canada, 2017 FCA 195 at paras. 13, 16; Canada v. Paletta, 2022 FCA 86 at para. 66. The Tax Court found (at pages 16 and 17 of its reasons) that the appellants made only minimal inquiries, despite the \u201cseveral red flags that ought to have aroused further suspicion and caused further inquiry.\u201d\n[8] The appellants submit that the Tax Court should have concluded, applying the correct test, that there was no wilful blindness, \u201cbecause there is no evidence that Mr. Bonin had any suspicion that the claim for management fees expense [sic] was a false statement\u201d (Appellants\u2019 memorandum, p. 11). The appellants further submit that the Tax Court erred by relying on its finding (at page 15 of its reasons) that \u201c[a] businessman like Mr. Bonin ought to have questioned further\u201d without finding actual suspicion on Mr. Bonin\u2019s part. However, this phrase, and the statement that the \u201cred flags \u2026 ought to have aroused further suspicion\u201d (emphasis added), supply the requisite finding of suspicion. While the appellants also appear to challenge the Tax Court\u2019s finding based on the weight it assigned to the evidence, it is not this Court\u2019s role on appeal to reweigh it.\n[9] Although, as the Tax Court noted, its finding on wilful blindness meant that the appellants also met the threshold for opening up an otherwise statute-barred year, it nonetheless went on to address the third issue, and the question of gross negligence.\n[10] The appellants say that, in doing so, the Tax Court failed to apply the proper test for gross negligence. They rely in particular on the statement of the test in Venne v. The Queen, 1984 CanLII 5717 (FC), [1984] C.T.C. 223. But the Tax Court specifically referred to Venne, and the Tax Court\u2019s statement of the test is both not inconsistent with Venne and consistent with this Court\u2019s more recent statements; see, for example, Wynter at paras. 18-21 and Paletta at paras. 65-68. Indeed, in the specific part of the Tax Court\u2019s statement of the test with which the appellants take issue, at page 18 of its reasons, the Court recites verbatim this Court\u2019s statement of the test in another recent decision, Deyab v. Canada, 2020 FCA 222 at para. 62. We see no reviewable error in the Tax Court\u2019s statement of the test for gross negligence.\n[11] For these reasons, we will dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\u201cJ.B.

It also sought to join the class, despite the deadline to opt in to the class action having passed. The Federal Court dismissed its request to intervene and to join the class (Tk'eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation v. Canada, 2023 FC 237, 2023 A.C.W.S. 647).\n[2] The judge disposed of the motion in writing and prior to receipt of the respondents\u2019 motion records. Salt River appeals on grounds relating to both the manner in which its motion was determined and the substance of the decision. The respondents\u2014the representative plaintiffs (Gottfriedson respondents) and the Attorney General of Canada\u2014argue that the Federal Court did not err in dismissing Salt River\u2019s motion, in either the process followed or in the reasons provided for its decision. The respondents also argue that the appeal is in any event moot, as the Federal Court\u2019s decision approving the settlement was not stayed and the settlement funds have been transferred to the trust established to manage the settlement funds in accordance with its terms.\n[3] Both Salt River and the Gottfriedson respondents seek to adduce fresh evidence on this appeal. While the fresh evidence is not dispositive of an issue in the appeal, for reasons that will become clear, it should be admitted. It provides essential information relating to the grounds of appeal and the question of mootness. The Gottfriedson respondents had no opportunity to put their evidence before the Federal Court prior to its disposition of the motion and none of the parties are prejudiced by its admission.\nThe class action and settlement agreement\n[4] The underlying class proceeding was certified in 2015 (Gottfriedson v. Canada, 2015 FC 706, [2015] F.C.J. No. 698). In broad terms, the action was brought by the representative plaintiff Bands seeking compensation for losses of Indigenous culture, language and social cohesion arising from the residential schools system. Uniquely in the context of class actions, and at the request of the Bands, the Band class claims proceeded on an opt-in basis. The Band class included \u201cany\u2026 Indian Band(s) that: (i) has or had some members who are or were Survivors, or in whose community a Residential School is or was located; and (ii) is specifically added to this claim in relation to one or more specifically identified Residential Schools\u201d (Federal Court decision at paras. 2-3).\n[5] A Federal Court judge was assigned to case manage the proceeding.\n[6] In 2022, the judge issued two orders extending the opt-in periods for Bands; on February 8, 2022 the opt-in period was extended until May 31, 2022, and on June 15, 2022, the opt-in period was further extended until June 30, 2022. These orders included steps to be taken by class counsel to provide notice of the extensions to Bands not already in the class, including posting the extended deadline on the dedicated class action website and emailing all Bands known to class counsel who had not yet opted in (Federal Court decision at paras. 5-7).\n[7] The reasons why the deadlines were extended twice are significant. The discovery of unmarked graves at the sites of former residential schools had a dramatic effect on the course of the litigation. Counsel described this as \u201ca game changer\u201d and advised the Federal Court that there was now a renewed interest in the class proceeding and that Bands needed time to assess and digest the implications of these discoveries on many levels, not just legal. Consequently, the deadlines were extended and new Bands were allowed to join the class.\n[8] After the June 30, 2022 deadline expired, six additional First Nations were granted leave to join the class in August 2022, and the Huron-Wendat were granted leave by the Court in September 2022. The seven Bands were let in following the deadline on consent, by agreement between class counsel and counsel for the Attorney General. No motion records nor supporting affidavits were filed.\n[9] The common issues trial began on September 12, 2022, and was scheduled to last 48 days. The parties subsequently requested an adjournment, and on September 20, 2022, the trial was adjourned to allow for settlement negotiations.\n[10] On January 18, 2023, a settlement was reached: the Government of Canada agreed to pay $2.8 billion to a trust fund administered by a not-for-profit entity. The funds were to be distributed by the trust to Bands in support of the \u201cFour Pillars\u201d of the settlement agreement: a) revival and protection of Indigenous languages; b) revival and protection of Indigenous cultures; c) protection and promotion of heritage; and d) wellness for Indigenous communities and their members. Two hundred thousand dollars was allocated to each Band to allow them to develop a plan as to how their share of the settlement funds would be spent. A list of the Band class members formed part of the agreement. There were 325 Band class members.\n[11] The settlement approval hearing took place on February 27 and 28, 2023. The Federal Court approved the settlement for reasons released on March 9, 2023 (Tk'eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation v. Canada, 2023 FC 327, 2023 CarswellNat 605 [Settlement Approval decision]). Three months later, on June 8, 2023, Canada settled the trust by transferring the settlement funds to the administering entity, and it is on this basis that the respondents contend the appeal is moot.\nSalt River\u2019s involvement in the class action\n[12] Salt River is a band under the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5. It is situated in the Northwest Territories, near the Alberta border. Its claim that it meets the first criterion for inclusion in the Band class, and thus that it would have been able to opt in prior to the deadline, is not disputed.\n[13] Salt River states that it was unaware of the class action and the opt-in requirement until late January 2023, when its Acting Chief was shown a news article about the settlement. Following a search of the former Chief\u2019s office and of all Band Council meeting minutes and resolutions for the past three years, Salt River was not able to find any notice of the proceeding or of the opt-in requirement. It claims that its ignorance of the class action was due to its limited administrative capacity and the health issues of its former Chief, with the Chief holding the only full-time position on Salt River\u2019s Council.\n[14] Shortly thereafter, on February 13, 2023, Salt River filed a notice of motion to intervene in the imminent settlement approval hearing. It did not request that the motion be dealt with in writing under rule 369 of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106. The motion was to be heard February 21, 2023. Salt River\u2019s motion was supported by several affidavits indicating that it had not received notice of the class action.\n[15] On February 15, 2023, the Gottfriedson respondents wrote to the Court to advise that they would be responding to the motion. They began drafting a responding affidavit and written representations to be served and filed in accordance with the deadlines in the Federal Courts Rules (i.e. two days before the motion was to be heard, per rule 365(1)(a)).\n[16] Two days later, on February 17, 2023, the Federal Court judge dismissed the motion, prior to receiving the responding materials and without an oral hearing.\n[17] Salt River appealed the order dismissing its motion for leave to intervene and join the class, but did not move to stay the settlement approval hearing pending disposition of its appeal.\nThe Federal Court decision\n[18] In dismissing Salt River\u2019s motion to intervene, the judge first noted that while Salt River was technically seeking intervener status in the class proceeding, it was in substance seeking to be added to the class. The judge then held that Salt River could not now opt in to the class, since it had not opted in by the twice-extended deadline of June 30, 2022. The judge noted that she was \u201csatisfied\u201d that class counsel took the steps set out in the Court\u2019s deadline extension orders to communicate the extended deadlines to potential Band class members across Canada (Federal Court decision at para. 8). The judge did not explain the basis upon which this conclusion was reached.\n[19] The judge also dismissed Salt River\u2019s request for intervener status. Citing the test from Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Canadian Council for Refugees, 2021 FCA 13, 481 C.R.R. (2d) 234 [Canadian Council], the judge concluded that Salt River was not directly affected by the outcome of the class proceeding, and that in any event, any interest raised by Salt River would be adequately represented at the settlement approval hearing by the other Band class members. The judge noted that Salt River\u2019s proposed challenge to the validity of the opt-in regime had not been raised by the parties in the context of the class action, as the only issue before the Court at the upcoming hearing would be whether the proposed settlement agreement was in the best interests of the class members (Federal Court decision at paras. 14-16).\n[20] Finally, the judge held that Salt River\u2019s intervention would not be in the interests of justice due to Salt River\u2019s delay in seeking intervener status, the impending settlement hearing, and the disruption and prejudice to parties if Salt River were allowed to intervene. The judge was also not satisfied that Salt River provided any reasonable explanation for its delay, given the \u201cextensive outreach by Class counsel to all Indian Bands known to Canada and Class counsel\u201d, as well as \u201cextensive media coverage\u201d of the proceeding (Federal Court decision at para. 20).\nIssues before us\n[21] Salt River contends that the Federal Court\u2019s failure to hold an oral hearing, despite one being requested and the importance of the issues, amounted to a breach of procedural fairness. The other two errors alleged by Salt River relate to the substance of the decision itself; more particularly, Salt River argues that the judge erred in applying a bright-line rule in considering whether it could opt in after the deadline, and secondly, in denying its motion to intervene. Salt River contends that the Court erred in concluding that it did not have a genuine interest in the proceeding as a potential class member.\n[22] Salt River seeks to have the Federal Court\u2019s order set aside, as well as an order granting it leave to intervene and to join as a class member. In the alternative, Salt River seeks to have this matter remitted to the Federal Court for a hearing.\n[23] The Attorney General and the Gottfriedson respondents argue that the judge did not err in disposing of the motion in writing, given the powers conferred on case management judges by rules 384.1 and 385 of the Federal Courts Rules as well as the general powers of the Court under rule 3 of the Federal Courts Rules. The Gottfriedson respondents argue that an oral hearing was not required as a matter of natural justice here, especially given the judge\u2019s familiarity with the matter.\n[24] The Gottfriedson respondents also argue that there was no error in the Court\u2019s decision to deny the motion to intervene and\/or to deny Salt River\u2019s request to join the class. The Gottfriedson respondents note that as an intervener, Salt River was precluded from raising any issue beyond whether the settlement was fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of the class (Gottfriedson Respondents\u2019 Memorandum of Fact and Law at paras. 51-52, citing Tsleil-Waututh Nation v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FCA 174, 414 D.L.R. (4th) 373). The question of whether Salt River could join the class should not be before the Court. The Gottfriedson respondents emphasize that the judge cited the correct legal test for intervention, and that her decision, as case management judge, is entitled to deference.\n[25] Finally, the Gottfriedson respondents argue that there was no error in denying Salt River entry to the class. They argue that the judge did not have the jurisdiction to do so on Salt River\u2019s motion, since the Court\u2019s jurisdiction on the settlement approval hearing was limited to approving or denying the settlement agreement as it stood. They contend that even if the Court had the necessary powers, it would not be in the best interests of the Band class, nor favourable to the integrity of the process, to add Salt River to the class at this stage. Denying Salt River entry into the class also would not prejudice Salt River as it would retain its rights against Canada.\nThe fresh evidence motion\n[26] The Gottfriedson respondents bring a motion to admit fresh evidence on this appeal. They seek leave to admit the evidence that they would have put before the judge on the motion below, had she not dealt with the motion without hearing from them. This evidence deals mainly with the steps taken by class counsel to provide notice of the class action to Bands across Canada (including Salt River), and evidence that the trust has now been settled (which came to be after the settlement approval hearing). The Attorney General takes no position on this motion.\n[27] Salt River does not oppose the fresh evidence motion, however, it seeks to introduce evidence in response to the fresh evidence of the Gottfriedson respondents. Specifically, Salt River seeks to introduce an affidavit from class counsel dated January 12, 2022, which explains why the Gottfriedson respondents sought to reopen the opt-in period and provide further notices to potential class members. The affidavit notes that the discovery of unmarked graves brought renewed interest in the class action and, importantly for the purposes of this appeal, that the previously published notice was confusing. This evidence therefore explains why certain Bands may not have initially opted in. Salt River also seeks to introduce evidence that shows that it was unable to find a record of the email notice of the class action sent by class counsel (Appellant\u2019s Supplemental Motion Record on Fresh Evidence Motion at pp. 2 and 19).\n[28] Importantly, Salt River observes that the fresh evidence of the Gottfriedson respondents does not contradict the fact that it did not become aware of this class action until January 2023 (Appellant\u2019s Written Representations on Fresh Evidence Motion at para. 8).\nThe fresh evidence should be allowed in\n[29] The test for fresh evidence on appeal was set out in Bell Canada v. Adwokat, 2023 FCA 106, 2023 CarswellNat 1503 at para. 4 [Adwokat]: it must be established that the evidence \u201c(1) could not have been adduced at trial with the exercise of due diligence; (2) is relevant in that it bears on a decisive or potentially decisive issue on appeal; (3) is credible in that it is reasonably capable of belief; and (4) is such that, if believed, could reasonably have affected the result in the [C]ourt below.\u201d Even where these criteria are not met, a court has limited residual discretion to admit new evidence on appeal where the interests of justice require it (Adwokat at para. 4).\n[30] Regarding the parties\u2019 due diligence, this criterion is obviously met for the evidence that only came into existence after the motion. However, it is also satisfied for the other evidence, which existed at the time of the motion but which was not before the Federal Court due to the Court choosing, of its own initiative, to decide the matter early and on the basis of Salt River\u2019s materials only. The due diligence criterion is not solely temporal\u2014rather, it focuses on the conduct of the parties (Barendregt v. Grebliunas, 2022 SCC 22, 469 D.L.R. (4th) 1 at para. 59). Both parties here acted with due diligence in preparing and submitting their materials, but were cut off at the pass, so to speak. Therefore, under the unique circumstances of this case, the evidence could not have been adduced in the Court below with the exercise of due diligence.\n[31] The proposed fresh evidence is relevant and credible: it is relevant to the issues of adequacy of notice, Salt River\u2019s reasons for missing the opt-in deadline, and the issue of mootness. Nor is there any reason to doubt its credibility: the evidence is uncontroversial and mostly supported by documentation.\n[32] The final criterion\u2014whether the evidence would have affected the result in the Court below\u2014presents difficulties. The Gottfriedson respondents seek to admit evidence that they say only reinforces the decision below, or that speaks to what the judge can be assumed to have known when she reached the conclusion that she was \u201csatisfied\u201d that notice had been sent to Salt River. Salt River, in contrast, seeks to contextualize the Gottfriedson respondents\u2019 evidence. In my view, the evidence submitted could conceivably have affected the outcome below.\n[33] Based on the above analysis, the evidence can be admitted under both the traditional test, as well as the broader interests of justice test. It is sufficient to say that the Adwokat criteria have been met, but it is also in the interests of justice that this Court has a full record before it. Salt River\u2019s fresh evidence is directly responsive to that of the Gottfriedson respondents and the motions were not opposed by either party. I would allow both motions to adduce fresh evidence.\nWhether the appeal is moot\n[34] The first question to be determined is whether the appeal is moot since the settlement approval hearing has taken place, the settlement has been approved, the approval order is final and has not been appealed, and the settlement has been implemented.\n[35] A matter is moot where there is no longer a live controversy which affects the rights of the parties (Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), 1989 CanLII 123 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342 at 353 [Borowski]). That is the case here. The settlement funds have been settled in the trust and the settlement approval order has not been stayed. The Attorney General has no further role in the proceeding.\n[36] There are, however, a number of reasons why this Court should exercise its discretion and entertain the appeal. Borowski provides that a court, in determining whether to hear a case that is moot, can consider the existence of an adversarial context, the concern for the judicial economy and the role of the court as an adjudicative branch in the political framework (at 358-363). Here, there is a robust adversarial relationship between the parties and the issues have been fully argued before us. Judicial economy is not in play, as the mootness argument was essentially woven into the fresh evidence motion and the substantive questions on appeal. These factors aside, it is in the interests of justice that the Court consider the substantive issue. As the circumstances here demonstrate, there is value in giving appellate guidance to judges considering whether to approve class action settlements.\nError in deciding the motion in writing\n[37] I begin with a review of some basic principles.\n[38] First, the standard of review for an allegation of procedural unfairness is functionally correctness: a court must ask whether the procedure was fair having regard to all of the circumstances (Mission Institution v. Khela, 2014 SCC 24, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 502 at para. 79; Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Canada, 2018 FCA 69, [2018] F.C.J. No. 382 at para. 54). For an alleged error of fact-finding, the standard is palpable and overriding error. A court can take into account the motion judge\u2019s role as case management judge in its analysis (see, for example, Paradissis v. Canada, 2019 FCA 70, 303 A.C.W.S. (3d) 881 at para. 6, citing Turmel v. Canada, 2016 FCA 9, 481 N.R. 139).\n[39] Second, a court is not required to hold an oral hearing in disposing of a motion.\n[40] In dealing with class actions, case management judges are given wide powers under the Federal Courts Rules, including the power to \u201cgive any directions or make any orders that are necessary for the just, most expeditious and least expensive outcome of the proceeding\u201d, per rule 385(1)(a). Judges are also authorized to deal with motions in writing under rule 369 of the Federal Courts Rules, and can exercise their discretion to do so based on the nature of the motion, the evidence, the issues, and the arguments (Adams v. Canada (Parole Board), 2022 FC 273, 2022 W.C.B. 494 at para. 19). Finally, this Court recently held in ViiV Healthcare Company v. Gilead Sciences Canada, Inc., 2021 FCA 122, 460 D.L.R. (4th) 272, that a court can act on its own initiative when confronted with a \u201cproblematic motion\u201d, though it should not be quick to do so, and it must always invite submissions and consider them (at paras. 22-27). I hasten to add that there was nothing problematic about Salt River\u2019s motion. It was promptly brought upon Salt River becoming aware of the proceeding and substantially in proper form (despite it being framed as an intervention motion, when it was in substance a motion to be added to the class, as the judge properly recognized).\n[41] Wide as the discretion of a case management judge may be, it is not unlimited. There are other factors that bear on how it should be exercised, and in this case those include the nature of the issues, the allegations, and, importantly, the expectations of the parties as to how their case will be presented. Put otherwise, counsel may present a much different argument if they know that the motion is to be disposed of in writing only. Here, all parties proceeded on the understanding that there would be an oral hearing with respect to Salt River\u2019s motion.\n[42] The nature of the evidence put before the Court by Salt River also constrained its exercise of discretion. Representatives of Salt River averred, under oath, that they had not received notice of the class action. This was a serious matter.\n[43] Class counsel contend that the judge was entitled to rely on her familiarity with the case and assume that the notices that the Court had directed to be sent were in fact sent and reached their recipients.\n[44] As a general proposition I agree, but again, there are limits. That assumption cannot be relied on in the face of sworn evidence to the contrary. While the judge does not say so directly, it is implicit in her reasons that she did not believe Salt River\u2019s affiants. The judge\u2019s reliance on the proposition that all that was to have been done, had in fact been done, was undermined by the uncontroverted evidence that the notice of the proceeding had not been received. Therefore, the Federal Court erred in making findings of fact not supported by the evidence before it on the motion: namely, that class counsel had effectively communicated the opt-in deadline to potential Band class members, including Salt River, contrary to Salt River\u2019s affidavits asserting the opposite. I note, parenthetically, that the fresh evidence clarifies that while notice had been sent to Salt River, it was unaware of the proceeding.\n[45] Finally, there are circumstances where an oral hearing is required. For the reasons that the judge expressed in the Settlement Approval decision, this settlement was historic in nature and designed to address decades of cultural assimilation through the residential school system. If Salt River was to be denied the opportunity to participate in this settlement, it should have had the right to make the oral submissions that both it and the Federal Courts Rules contemplated and that the parties requested and anticipated. To this I would add that the judge did not consider the overarching objective of reconciliation in deciding to render the decision on the motion in writing and without the benefit of full submissions.\n[46] The judge therefore erred in deciding the matter in writing and without hearing from the parties.\n[47] This finding would be sufficient to conclude this matter; however, there are other concerns with respect to the Federal Court\u2019s treatment of Salt River\u2019s attempt to join the class.\nWhether Salt River could join the class\n[48] I do not accept that Salt River\u2019s failure to opt in by the deadline, on its own, constituted a sound discretionary basis for refusing Salt River\u2019s motion to be added to the class. The judge erred in law in her approach to the issue and her exercise of discretion cannot be sustained in light of the facts.\n[49] Beginning with the law, the judge did not consider the jurisprudence with respect to whether a party should be allowed to opt in after the deadline. (I am assuming that there was, in fact \u201ca deadline\u201d, given the multiple and unexplained extensions and its fluid nature.) Had the Court directed itself to the jurisprudence, it might have reached a different conclusion.\n[50] Where a settlement amount is fixed, a court should apply a balancing test (considering factors such as prejudice to the parties and the reason for delay) in determining whether a potential class member should be allowed to join the class after the relevant deadline (Harrington v. Dow Corning Corp., 2001 BCSC 221, 84 B.C.L.R. (3d) 368 at para. 22; Boys and Girls Club of London Foundation c. Molson Coors Brewing Co., 2010 QCCS 6306, [2010] Q.J. No. 14108 at paras. 10-11; and Gregg v. Freightliner Ltd., 2012 BCSC 415, [2012] B.C.W.L.D. 3314 at para. 73 [Gregg]; see also Johnson v. Ontario, 2022 ONCA 725, 475 D.L.R. (4th) 344 at para. 52).\n[51] The Court in Gregg noted that, save for situations where a judge has become functus, \u201cthe jurisprudence does not appear to endorse an absolute bar on\u2026 extending the time to opt-in after a settlement agreement has been reached\u201d, pointing to a court\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in advancing the goals of class actions (at para. 64). This applies with particular force in the context of a class action addressing the harms caused to Indigenous culture by residential schools with the objective of reconciliation.\n[52] I find it difficult to determine why the Federal Court denied Salt River class status. The only reason given by the judge appears to be that Salt River was out of time. The judge does not address what distinguishes Salt River from the other Bands allowed to join after the deadline (Federal Court decision at paras. 10-12). In addressing Salt River\u2019s request for intervener status, the principal factors apparently motivating the judge\u2019s decision were Salt River\u2019s delay in bringing the motion to opt in and prejudice to the class arising from a delay of the approval of the settlement (Federal Court decision at paras. 15-20).\n[53] The uncontroverted evidence confirms the assertion that Salt River did not know of the class action until late January 2023, and it acted promptly upon learning of it. The judge, however, does not grapple with the question of whether Salt River\u2019s delay to join the class was excusable.\n[54] Insofar as the timing of Salt River\u2019s motion was concerned, it will be recalled that the class action commenced in 2015. In September 2022, the common issues trial commenced and was scheduled to last approximately 10 weeks, with the damages portion of the trial set to proceed at a later date (Settlement Approval decision at para. 15). Other Bands were added to the class before trial began in August and September 2022 on the basis of no evidence at all\u2014simply on the consent of counsel. The settlement itself was only announced January 18, 2023. There was evidence before the judge that Salt River did not become aware of the action until January of 2023. Further, there is no consistency in the treatment accorded to Bands that were allowed to join after the expiry of the opt-in period and Salt River which was not, and no explanation was provided by the Federal Court for its lack of consistency in its treatment of would-be class members.\n[55] The hearing date for the settlement approval was entirely within the judge\u2019s control. Salt River\u2019s request could have been fairly considered had there not been a precipitous rush to have a settlement approval hearing on the date originally set. In exercising discretion with respect to scheduling decisions, judges must have an eye to the efficient administration of justice. But there is a strong countervailing principle, and that is that efficiency must not come at the expense of ensuring fairness to the parties.\n[56] The judge seemed to proceed on the basis that the settlement approval hearing was an immovable target and did not consider whether Salt River\u2019s motion to join could have been heard prior to the settlement approval hearing. The February 27 date was an arbitrary one, entirely in the discretion of the judge to move.\n[57] Nor did the judge explicitly consider the prejudice to Salt River if it was not allowed to join the class. The judge reasoned that since Salt River was not a member of the Band Class, it would not be directly affected by the outcome of the proceeding. This implies that Salt River would not be prejudiced by the Federal Court\u2019s decision, since Salt River would retain its rights against Canada.\n[58] The judge erred in giving this any weight. It took eight years to reach this settlement, involving 325 Bands; how a single, small Band could achieve a proportionate outcome is, at best, conjecture. While Canada said in its submissions that it was \u201copen\u201d to reach a similar accommodation with Salt River, this Court notes that over a year has transpired since the settlement approval and no accommodation has been reached, nor is there any evidence that steps have been taken in this regard.\nThe motion to intervene\n[59] At the risk of repetition, the judge erred in deciding the matter without holding an oral hearing. Again, as noted earlier at paragraph 47, while this is sufficient to conclude the matter, the Federal Court\u2019s consideration of Salt River\u2019s request to intervene requires comment. It is readily apparent that there were palpable and overriding errors in the application of the test by the judge.\n[60] The judge erred in finding that Salt River would not be directly affected by the outcome of the settlement approval hearing and also simultaneously finding that Salt River\u2019s interests would be adequately represented by the Band class members who had opted in.\n[61] It is obvious that Salt River would be directly affected by the outcome of the settlement approval hearing: it met the requirements to opt in to the Band class (which does not appear to be contested) and, absent a stay pending appeal, the approval of the settlement effectively put an end to its ability to join the class. Additionally, the conclusion that Salt River\u2019s interests could be sufficiently represented by class members cannot be sustained. It is, on its face, illogical: existing class members\u2019 interests would be diametrically opposed to Salt River\u2019s, as Salt River\u2019s inclusion may reduce the settlement funds available to all other class members.\n[62] The only possible outcomes of the settlement approval hearing were the denial or approval of the settlement. However, in making that decision, a judge is required to consider expressions of support and objections and communications with class members during litigation (see Settlement Approval decision at para. 49). Given the unique circumstances of this action\u2014an opt-in class action\u2014this could have encompassed consideration of the adequacy of notice to Salt River.\n[63] None of the parties to the settlement agreement had any interest in discussing the question of whether Salt River had received notice or should be a member of the class, and to this extent, Salt River could be characterized as having raised a new issue. Nevertheless, these were questions central to the settlement approval hearing itself, and in respect of which the judge had an obligation to be satisfied in determining whether the settlement was in the best interests of the class. Criticisms of communications between class counsel and class members, for example, can encompass both the content of the communications sent to class members, as well as the efforts deployed by class counsel to distribute such communications (Lin v. Airbnb, Inc., 2021 FC 1260, 2021 CarswellNat 5129 at para. 52). This factor would be particularly relevant in cases such as this, where questions had been raised as to the effectiveness of the notices. Additionally, the objective of this settlement and its asserted historic significance should have been taken into account by the case management judge.\nConclusion\n[64] As noted, the settlement funds have been transferred to the trust and no interim relief was sought to stay the settlement approval decision or the implementation of the settlement pending Salt River\u2019s appeal. Apart from the Federal Court\u2019s limited continuing supervisory jurisdiction over its administration, the action is at an end and the judge is functus. Despite the errors identified, there is no executory order that this Court can issue which would rectify the judgment of the Federal Court and I would therefore dismiss the appeal without costs.\n\u201cDonald J.

The Board dismissed the applicant\u2019s grievance, upholding the employer\u2019s termination decision.\n[2] At the hearing in this Court, the applicant moved to exclude an affidavit filed by the respondent, on the basis that it was fresh evidence. The brief affidavit contains exhibits including the decision under review, interim decisions by the Board, the Board\u2019s decision relating to a separate staffing grievance, the employer\u2019s speaking points for the Board hearing, and exhibits presented to the Board, not all of which were included in the applicant\u2019s record. The applicant\u2019s concern that this is fresh evidence is without merit, as the material is not new. I would dismiss the motion.\n[3] The applicant worked at Health Canada from 2002 to 2014. In July 2014, following her manager\u2019s refusal of a leave request, the applicant wrote an email to her bargaining agent representative indicating that one day soon she would \u201csnap\u201d and commit violence towards her manager.\n[4] Following an administrative investigation and a disciplinary hearing, the applicant\u2019s employment was terminated for cause. The Board considered the applicant\u2019s termination grievance afresh, including oral and documentary evidence offered by the applicant and the employer, and declined to overturn the employer\u2019s decision.\n[5] The standard of review for the Board\u2019s decision is reasonableness: Walker v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FCA 44 at para. 2 [Walker]; Samson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 212 at para. 2.\n[6] As the Supreme Court held in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov], \u201ca reasonable decision is one that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker\u201d: para. 85. A reasonableness review is not a treasure hunt for error; any shortcomings in the decision must be sufficiently central or significant to warrant intervention: Vavilov at paras. 100 and 102.\n[7] The focus of a reasonableness review is on the decision actually made and whether it is unreasonable. The reviewing court does not \u201credo\u201d the analysis that the decision maker did to determine what the court might have decided in the circumstances: Vavilov at para. 83.\n[8] The applicant also raises procedural fairness arguments. The standard of review for procedural fairness is best described as correctness, and the ultimate question is whether the applicant knew the case to meet and had a full and fair chance to respond: Watson v. Canadian Union of Public Employees, 2023 FCA 48 at para. 17; Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 at paras. 54 and 56.\n[9] In my view, the Board\u2019s decision was reasonable, and its process was fair.\n[10] In determining whether the applicant\u2019s termination was justified, the Board applied the well-established framework from William Scott & Co. v. C.F.A.W., Local P-162, 1976 CarswellBC 518, [1977] 1 Can. L.R.B.R. 1 [William Scott], asking whether there were grounds for discipline and, if so, whether the penalty imposed was appropriate: Walker at para. 4; Basra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 FCA 24 at para. 24; Toronto (City) Board of Education v. O.S.S.T.F., District 15, 1997 CanLII 378 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 487 at para. 49.\n[11] As the applicant conceded that her misconduct warranted discipline, the Board\u2019s analysis focused on the appropriateness of termination as a consequence. The Board properly recognized that threats of violence do not automatically justify termination, and that it had to consider both aggravating and mitigating factors, as it did: Board Reasons at paras. 263 and 265.\n[12] The applicant argues that the Board failed to properly take into account her evidence of workplace bullying and harassment and the significant impact that it had on her state of mind. I disagree.\n[13] A harassment grievance and other grievances filed by the applicant had been dismissed or settled and withdrawn prior to the Board hearing. Accordingly, the Board was not charged with determining whether there had been harassment as defined by the employer\u2019s policy or the law. The Board did, however, consider whether the applicant\u2019s perception of harassment and a toxic work environment were mitigating factors in its William Scott analysis: Board Reasons at para. 128.\n[14] The Board carefully considered the evidence, finding that the applicant\u2019s belief that she was harassed was credible and reasonable, as was the evidence of a toxic work environment. However, the Board could \u201conly go so far\u201d in assigning weight to these as mitigating factors without medical evidence of a diminished mental state: Board Reasons at paras. 299 and 301. The Board determined that there had been no immediate provocation and that the applicant\u2019s state of mind did not justify a threat of violence or mitigate the seriousness of the misconduct, such that it could set aside the employer\u2019s termination decision: Board Reasons at para. 303.\n[15] The Board\u2019s conclusion was based on its factual findings and a weighing of the aggravating and mitigating factors. Absent exceptional circumstances, this Court must refrain from reweighing and reassessing the evidence before the Board: Vavilov at para. 125. The applicant has not shown that the Board fundamentally misapprehended, or failed to account for, the facts. Rather, the Board\u2019s reasons show that it meaningfully grappled with the evidence of harassment and the applicant\u2019s state of mind, which was and remains the cornerstone of the applicant\u2019s case.\n[16] The Board\u2019s decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints. There is no basis for this Court to intervene.\n[17] Turning to the applicant\u2019s procedural fairness arguments, the applicant submits that she was denied discovery in the Board proceedings and not provided with a transcript of the proceedings. The applicant also takes issue with the order of the proceedings and being subject to the burden of proof in establishing mitigating factors in the William Scott analysis. The latter is well-established in the case law: Wilson v. Treasury Board (Solicitor General Canada \u2013 Correctional Service), [1995] C.P.S.S.R.B. No. 23 at para. 18; King v. Deputy Head (Canada Border Services Agency), 2010 PSLRB 31 at para. 186, aff\u2019d 2012 FC 488, aff\u2019d 2013 FCA 131.\n[18] Concerning the applicant\u2019s other procedural fairness arguments, I note that the applicant was represented by counsel before the Board. No request for discovery was made, and the parties agreed with the order of proceedings. There is no requirement for a transcript of the Board\u2019s proceedings. Importantly, the Board\u2019s reasons show that the applicant fully understood the case that she had to meet and had a full and fair opportunity to respond. There are no procedural unfairness concerns warranting this Court\u2019s intervention.\n[19] At the Board hearing, the applicant requested anonymization of the decision, which the Board refused. I see no reviewable error in the Board\u2019s decision on this issue, for which it gave detailed reasons: Board Reasons at paras. 13-25. It was open to the Board to reach its conclusion based on the circumstances of the proceeding before it and the open court principle. The Board\u2019s decision also accords with the Board\u2019s Policy on Openness and Privacy: Board Reasons at para. 19.\n[20] For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the application for judicial review.

ROBERT CHAD\nAppellant\nand\nMINISTER OF NATIONAL REVENUE\nRespondent\nDealt with in writing without appearance of parties.\nOrder delivered at Ottawa, Ontario, on March 21, 2024.\nREASONS FOR ORDER BY:\nLOCKE J.A.\nDate: 20240321\nDocket: A-333-23\nCitation: 2024 FCA 56\nPresent: LOCKE J.A.\nBETWEEN:\nS. ROBERT CHAD\nAppellant\nand\nMINISTER OF NATIONAL REVENUE\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR ORDER\nLOCKE J.A.\nI. Background [1] This decision comes in the context of an appeal from a decision of the Federal Court (2023 FC 1481, per Justice Martine St-Louis) that struck, without leave to amend, an amended notice of application filed by the appellant, S. Robert Chad. The Federal Court found that the application was so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success.\n[2] Mr. Chad now moves for an Order determining the content of the appeal book. He proposes a list of several documents, including (i) an affidavit in his name affirmed on May 10, 2023 (the Chad Affidavit) and relied on as his affidavit evidence pursuant to Rule 306 of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R\/98-106, in the now-struck application before the Federal Court, and (ii) a certified transcript of the hearing before the Federal Court held on October 30, 2023 that led to the decision under appeal (the Transcript).\n[3] The respondent, the Minister of National Revenue (the Minister), opposes Mr. Chad\u2019s motion only in respect of the Chad Affidavit and the Transcript. The Minister argues that the Transcript should be excluded as a whole, and the Chad Affidavit should likewise be excluded, but with the exception of Exhibit 7 thereof, which is a demand letter from Mr. Chad dated November 1, 2022 (the Demand Letter).\n[4] The parties appear to agree that the content of the appeal book is to be determined in accordance with Rules 343(2) and 344(1), and jurisprudence related thereto. Rule 343(2) provides that the appeal book should include \u201conly such documents, exhibits and transcripts as are required to dispose of the issues on appeal.\u201d Rule 344(1) provides as follows:\n344 (1) An appeal book shall contain, on consecutively numbered pages and in the following order,\n344 (1) Le dossier d\u2019appel contient, sur des pages num\u00e9rot\u00e9es cons\u00e9cutivement, les documents ci-apr\u00e8s dans l\u2019ordre suivant :\n(a) a table of contents describing each document;\na) une table des mati\u00e8res d\u00e9signant chaque document;\n(b) the notice of appeal and any notice of cross-appeal;\nb) l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019avis d\u2019appel incident;\n(c) the order appealed from, as signed and entered, and any reasons, including dissenting reasons, given in respect of that order;\nc) l\u2019ordonnance port\u00e9e en appel, telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e et inscrite ainsi que les motifs, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, y compris toute dissidence;\n(d) the originating document, any other pleadings and any other document in the first instance that defines the issues in the appeal;\nd) l\u2019acte introductif d\u2019instance, les autres actes de proc\u00e9dure et tout autre document d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans la premi\u00e8re instance qui d\u00e9finit les questions en litige dans l\u2019appel;\n(e) subject to subsection (2), all documents, exhibits and transcripts agreed on under subsection 343(1) or ordered to be included on a motion under subsection 343(3);\ne) sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), les documents, pi\u00e8ces et transcriptions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans l\u2019entente vis\u00e9e au paragraphe 343(1) ou dans l\u2019ordonnance qui en tient lieu;\n(f) any order made in respect of the conduct of the appeal;\nf) toute ordonnance relative au d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019appel;\n(g) any other document relevant to the appeal;\ng) tout autre document pertinent;\n(h) an agreement reached under subsection 343(1) as to the contents of the appeal book or an order made under subsection 343(3); and\nh) l\u2019entente vis\u00e9e au paragraphe 343(1) ou l\u2019ordonnance qui en tient lieu;\n(i) a certificate in Form 344, signed by the appellant\u2019s solicitor, stating that the contents of the appeal book are complete and legible.\ni) le certificat \u00e9tabli selon la formule 344, sign\u00e9 par l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant et attestant que le contenu du dossier d\u2019appel est complet et lisible.\nII. The Transcript [5] The Minister objects to the inclusion of the Transcript in the appeal book because it contains only legal argument, and is not required to dispose of the issues on appeal: Collins v. Canada, 2010 FCA 128 at para. 2. Mr. Chad argues that the Minister tendered evidence at the hearing during her submissions, to which Mr. Chad objected, and that the Transcript is therefore not limited to legal argument. The Minister counters that the alleged evidence was simply submissions in reply to Mr. Chad\u2019s argument that a request for information under the Access to Information Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1, would not be an adequate alternative remedy.\n[6] Mr. Chad argues that the limitation on the content of the appeal book contemplated in Rule 343(2) is a flexible one, and a document should be included if a party \u201chas a reasonable basis for believing that it may wish to rely on that document to support one of its argument on appeal.\u201d Mr. Chad cites Bojangles' International, LLC v. Bojangles Caf\u00e9 Ltd., 2006 FCA 291 at para. 6, in support of this argument, but he takes the quoted passage further than was intended. It was not intended to override the principle that the document in question must be required to dispose of the issues on appeal. The mere fact that a party may wish to rely on a document cannot be sufficient.\n[7] I agree with the Minister that the Minister\u2019s submissions in question at the hearing were not evidence. Moreover, there is no indication that they were treated as such by the Federal Court. The issue of whether a request for information under the Access to Information Act would be an adequate alternative remedy is a question of law. The Transcript is not required to decide that issue; nor am I convinced that it is required to decide any other issue on appeal.\n[8] I accept Mr. Chad\u2019s argument that doubt as to whether a document should be included in the appeal book should be resolved in favour of inclusion (West Vancouver v. British Columbia, 2005 FCA 281 at para. 4), but I have no doubt that the Transcript should not be included.\nIII. The Chad Affidavit [9] The Minister objects to the inclusion of the Chad Affidavit in the appeal book, with the exception of the Demand Letter, because it was not put before the Federal Court by either party in its motion record, and was not relied on as evidence. The Minister acknowledges that Mr. Chad referred to his affidavit in his written submissions before the Federal Court, but notes that he did not include it in his motion record. The Minister also notes that Mr. Chad\u2019s counsel acknowledged explicitly at the hearing before the Federal Court that he was not relying on the Chad Affidavit as evidence.\n[10] Moreover, the Minister notes that, in the context of a motion to strike a notice of application, the facts therein are taken to be true: Canada (National Revenue) v. JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc., 2013 FCA 250 at para. 52. Therefore, no evidence is required to support those facts, either before the Federal Court or before this Court.\n[11] Mr. Chad argues that his affidavit is required to counter the Minister\u2019s submission, which was accepted by the Federal Court, that the amended notice of application \u201clargely includes bald and speculative allegations and conclusory statements which cannot support the relief sought\u201d. Mr. Chad argues that he relies on his affidavit not for the truth of its contents, but as proof that the allegations were not unsupported.\n[12] In my view, Mr. Chad\u2019s argument cannot overcome the following facts (i) evidence is not required on a motion to strike, (ii) the Chad Affidavit was not submitted as evidence in the parties\u2019 motion records, and (iii) Mr. Chad explicitly acknowledged that he was not relying on the Chad Affidavit as evidence.\n[13] The Minister acknowledges that the Demand Letter should be included in the appeal book because it is referred to in the amended notice of application in issue. In reply, Mr. Chad argues that the Minister\u2019s acknowledgement of the relevance of the Demand Letter to the present appeal must operate as an acknowledgement of the relevance of the rest of the Chad Affidavit. As he puts it, \u201c[w]hat is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\u201d I find that expression misplaced in this context. It might apply if somehow the Minister\u2019s case would be favoured by the inclusion of the Demand Letter in the appeal book, but I see no indication of that. In my view, the inclusion of the Demand Letter in the appeal book is not in dispute, but the inclusion of the rest of the Chad Affidavit is.\n[14] I agree with the Minister that the bulk of the Chad Affidavit should be excluded from the appeal book because it is not in evidence. The Demand Letter should be included because its inclusion is not in dispute and because it is referred to in the amended notice of application.\nIV. Conclusion [15] For the foregoing reasons, I will order that the appeal book include the documents proposed by the Minister as listed in Schedule A to her responding motion record. I will also order that Mr. Chad pay the Minister\u2019s costs of this motion in any event of the cause.\n\"George R.

On March 16, 2021, the PSC denied Mr. Sinclair\u2019s request.\n[2] The election was held on April 12, 2021 and three days later on April 15, 2021, Mr. Sinclair filed an application with the Federal Court for judicial review of the decision of the PSC denying him permission to seek nomination as, and be, a candidate in that election. Mr. Sinclair, in his notice of application for judicial review, stated that he was seeking the following:\n1. An order setting aside the PSC decision and declaring that the Applicant was entitled to seek nomination and be a candidate the Yukon territorial election held on April 12, 2021;\n2. In the alternative, an order setting aside the PSC decision and remitting the matter back to the PSC for redetermination in accordance with any directions provided by this Court;\n3. The costs of this application; and\n4. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court deems just.\n[3] The Federal Court (per Sadrehashemi J., 2023 FC 750) found that Mr. Sinclair\u2019s application was moot based on the test as set out in Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), [1989] 1 SCR 342, 57 DLR (4th) 231 (Borowski). The election for which he was seeking to be a candidate was held before he made his application for judicial review. In this appeal, Mr. Sinclair does not challenge the finding that his application was moot.\n[4] In Borowski, the Supreme Court of Canada identified the relevant criteria to be considered by a court in deciding whether to exercise its discretion to decide a matter that is moot:\n(a)the existence of an adversarial relationship between the parties;\n(b)the concern for judicial economy; and\n(c)the need for the court to be sensitive to its adjudicative role.\n[5] The Federal Court Judge considered these factors and declined to exercise her discretion to decide the application for judicial review. Mr. Sinclair\u2019s application was therefore dismissed. In this appeal, Mr. Sinclair challenges this decision of the Federal Court Judge to decline to exercise her discretion to decide his application for judicial review.\n[6] In my view, the Federal Court Judge did not commit any error that would warrant our intervention in declining to exercise her discretion to decide Mr. Sinclair\u2019s judicial review application, based on the record that was before her. This is sufficient to dismiss this appeal.\n[7] Mr. Sinclair submitted that he is seeking statements of general principles from this Court that could be applied to any future decision of the PSC on an application by a public prosecutor for permission to be a candidate in an election.\n[8] I would note that guidance has already been provided by this Court in Taman v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FCA 1 (Taman) on what is to be addressed, from an administrative law perspective, in a decision of the PSC regarding a request by a public prosecutor to be a candidate in an election.\n[9] Guidance has also been provided by the Supreme Court in Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest v. Northwest Territories (Language, Culture and Employment), 2023 SCC 31 (CSFTNO) (and the other decisions of the Supreme Court referred to therein) concerning the application of Charter rights and values in administrative decisions.\n[10] It was not contested in this appeal that decisions by the PSC refusing to grant public servants permission to seek elected office must be justified to the applicants (Taman at para. 47; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653 at para. 95) and must reflect a proportionate balancing of their Charter rights or the values underlying them (CSFTNO at para. 73).\n[11] It is far from clear what other general guidance could be provided by this Court. The Federal Court Judge, in paragraph 15 of her reasons, referred to three declarations that Mr. Sinclair was seeking:\ni) the PSC\u2019s decision disproportionately impacted his Charter rights;\nii) with the exception of the DPP [Director of Public Prosecutions] and the Deputy Directors of Public Prosecutions, federal Crown prosecutors are presumptively permitted to seek nomination and\/or run as candidates in federal, provincial, or territorial elections; and\niii) prior to issuing any decision contrary to that presumption, the PSC must refer that determination to this Court under subsection 18.3(1) of the Federal Courts Act, RSC, 1985, c F-7 on the issue of whether the PSC\u2019s proposed disposition disproportionately impacts the prosecutor\u2019s Charter rights.\n[12] The first declaration relates directly to the PSC decision that is the subject of Mr. Sinclair\u2019s judicial review application. Since his application was moot and the Federal Court Judge did not exercise her discretion to decide his application even though it was moot, this requested declaration did not warrant any further consideration by the Federal Court Judge.\n[13] Neither one of the other two declarations arise from the PSC decision nor are they identified as requested declarations in Mr. Sinclair\u2019s notice of application. These requested declarations are general declarations that Mr. Sinclair is seeking to have applied in a future decision of the PSC. The Federal Court Judge found that these requested declarations were not appropriate and Mr. Sinclair has not established that the Federal Court Judge erred in making this finding.\n[14] There is one matter that was raised in argument that warrants a comment. The PSC in its decision found that a sufficient mitigating factor could not be identified for two specified risks to the perception of political impartiality that could result from granting Mr. Sinclair\u2019s request. In particular, the PSC referred to the risk stated as \u201creputational concerns related to the role of Crown prosecutors\u201d. It is not clear whether this statement is limited to Mr. Sinclair\u2019s role as a Crown prosecutor in Whitehorse or to all Crown prosecutors.\n[15] Any decision under the Public Service Employment Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22, ss. 12, 13 (the PSEA) to grant or deny permission for a public servant, who is otherwise eligible to be a candidate in an election, is to be based on the facts and circumstances related to that particular person. A blanket prohibition on any Crown prosecutor seeking to be a candidate in an election would not be consistent with the purpose of Part 7 of the PSEA: \u201cto recognize the right of employees to engage in political activities while maintaining the principle of political impartiality in the public service\u201d (section 112 of the PSEA).\n[16] I would dismiss the appeal. Since the parties agreed that the successful party would be entitled to $3,000 in costs, I would award the respondent costs fixed in the amount of $3,000.\n\u201cWyman W.

In that decision, the Minister confirmed her intention to revoke Sigma Chi\u2019s registration as a charity.\n[2] Sigma Chi was registered as a charity with effect from 1992. It describes itself as an international fraternal organization with 244 active undergraduate chapters and 152 alumni chapters across Canada and the United States. When it was registered, one of its stated objectives was to \u201cassist deserving undergraduate, graduate, and other students attending or enrolled at institutions and systems of higher education in Canada who are in financial need to continue and complete their education at such institutions and systems.\u201d\n[3] An organization must meet a number of statutory requirements to qualify and continue to qualify for charitable registration. In 2010 and 2011, the Canada Revenue Agency audited Sigma Chi\u2019s operations. The audit identified a number of areas of non-compliance. These included Sigma Chi\u2019s failure to devote all of its resources to charitable activities and the provision of personal benefits to members. The audit found that eligibility for the majority of Sigma Chi\u2019s scholarships was restricted to its members.\n[4] In March 2011, the Minister and Sigma Chi entered into a compliance agreement to address issues identified in the audit. In the agreement, Sigma Chi agreed, among other things, to \u201cdevote all of its resources to charitable activities,\u201d and to not restrict its scholarships and financial assistance to Sigma Chi members.\n[5] The CRA commenced a second audit in November 2017. The Minister informed Sigma Chi of findings from the audit that Sigma Chi was not complying with statutory requirements, including by failing to devote its resources to its own charitable activities, failing to maintain adequate books and records, and issuing non-compliant tax receipts. The audit also found that in the 2015 and 2016 fiscal periods respectively, 61% and 74% of total resources spent on scholarships and awards were for \u201cinhouse scholarships,\u201d which are restricted to members and pledges, and that some scholarships were awarded based on the recipient\u2019s role in Sigma Chi or how they represented its ideals. The audit determined that Sigma Chi\u2019s activities were primarily for the benefit of its members, not for the benefit of the public (as the ITA requires of a registered charity).\n[6] Sigma Chi provided written representations to the Minister in response to the audit. After considering these representations, the Minister determined that Sigma Chi did not meet the requirements for registration as a charity, and issued a notice of intention to revoke. Sigma Chi filed an objection in response. The Minister reviewed Sigma Chi\u2019s submissions in support of its objection, but found that they failed to demonstrate that Sigma Chi met the requirements for maintaining its registration. However, she decided in light of the objection that she would not continue to rely on one of the grounds she had initially advanced\u2014the failure to meet the requirements for books and records in subsection 230(2) of the ITA.\n[7] The Minister now relies on three grounds for revocation: (1) that Sigma Chi has provided private benefits for members, and thus has not been operated exclusively for charitable purposes as required by paragraph 149.1(1)(a) of the ITA; (2) that it has provided funds to non-qualified donees, contrary to paragraph 149.1(1)(a.1); and (3) that it did not have direction and control over funds sent to an American organization, and thus failed to devote all of its resources to charitable activities it itself carried on, contrary to paragraph 149.1(1)(a.1): Canadian Committee for the Tel Aviv Foundation v. Canada, 2002 FCA 72 at para. 40.\n[8] Sigma Chi contests all three of these findings. It is common ground that the standard of review in respect of these findings is the highly deferential standard of palpable and overriding error, and that to displace the Minister\u2019s decision based on them, Sigma Chi must demonstrate palpable and overriding error in respect of all three: Colel Chabad Lubavitch Foundation of Israel v. Canada (National Revenue), 2022 FCA 108 at paras. 49, 51. Sigma Chi also submits that the Minister breached her duty of procedural fairness, and that her conduct raises a reasonable apprehension of bias. We do not agree that any of these grounds are made out.\n[9] First, we see no palpable and overriding error in the finding that Sigma Chi has provided private benefits to its members through its inhouse scholarships. While Sigma Chi submits that these scholarships are open to all male university students eligible to apply for Sigma Chi membership, they are ultimately payable only to recipients who are accepted as members or pledges. Moreover, despite Sigma Chi\u2019s commitment in the compliance agreement to \u201cdevote all of its resources to charitable activities\u201d and to not restrict the beneficiaries of the scholarships and educational assistance program, the record shows that it continued to grant inhouse scholarships in 2015, 2016, 2020, and 2021. In 2015 and 2016 respectively, 75% and 82% of Sigma Chi\u2019s scholarship funds were restricted to Sigma Chi members and pledges. In 2020 and 2021, Sigma Chi awarded $216,760 in inhouse scholarships. The Minister also points out that, at the time of its registration, Sigma Chi\u2019s stated purpose of assisting students pursuing higher education made no mention of any restriction to members or pledges. But as recently as May 2023, Sigma Chi stated on its website that \u201c[t]he Foundation exists as a vehicle for local Active Chapters, Alumni Chapters and\/or House Corporations to raise tax-deductible funds for educational purposes\u2014primarily for the benefit of Active Chapters and Active brothers\u201d (emphasis added). This is not a charitable purpose under the ITA.\n[10] Second, we also see no reviewable error in the Minister\u2019s finding that Sigma Chi has provided funds to non-qualified donees by making loans to Sigma Chi fraternity housing corporations, established to provide housing to members. In addition, it breached the compliance agreement by failing to obtain security for its loans to London Sigma Chi Properties and by making a further advance to London Sigma Chi Properties, despite its obligations under the compliance agreement. The loans and advance to London Sigma Chi Properties involved significant sums. According to the first audit, the loans totaled $403,015. The further advance was of $25,000.\n[11] Third, we see no reviewable error in the Minister\u2019s conclusion that Sigma Chi failed to maintain direction and control over the Horizon Scholarship program, a program partially funded by Sigma Chi and administered in the United States. As the Minister points out, Sigma Chi has only one of the eight seats on the governing board, and only two of 16 on the selection committee. There was ample support in the record for the Minister\u2019s conclusion that Sigma Chi did not have direction and control over the use of its funds.\n[12] Finally, in our view, Sigma Chi has failed to make out a reasonable apprehension of bias, and there was no deprivation of procedural fairness.\n[13] The test for establishing a reasonable apprehension of bias is whether a reasonable and informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, and having thought the matter through, would think it is more likely than not that the decision maker, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly: Yukon Francophone School Board, Education Area #23 v. Yukon (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 25 at para. 20. There is a \u201chigh burden\u201d on the party seeking to establish a reasonable apprehension of bias: Yukon Francophone at para. 26. Sigma Chi\u2019s grounds for claiming a reasonable apprehension of bias fail to meet this high burden.\n[14] Sigma Chi submits that the Minister\u2019s conduct raises a reasonable apprehension of bias because she treated Sigma Chi in a manner dissimilar to other organizations that restrict their scholarships to a subset of the public. Sigma Chi mentions scholarships offered by the University of Toronto that are restricted to students enrolled at Trinity College. However, as this Court has held in the tax context, the fact that others benefitted from an exemption is \u201cnot relevant\u201d to whether a particular taxpayer should benefit from that same exemption: R. v. Sinclair, 2003 FCA 348 at para. 7. Even if comparisons were relevant, the record before us falls well short of providing an evidentiary basis on which the Court could draw meaningful comparisons.\n[15] Sigma Chi also submits that the Minister\u2019s refusal to consider Sigma Chi\u2019s offers to take corrective measures grounds a reasonable apprehension of bias. However, as the Minister notes, Sigma Chi was given three formal opportunities to respond to the issues identified by the Minister. The record before us shows that Sigma Chi\u2019s submissions were taken seriously, and were thoroughly reviewed and considered. We agree with the Minister that Sigma Chi was not entitled to continuously negotiate further corrective measures, especially given its failure to meet its obligations under the compliance agreement.\n[16] For these reasons, we will dismiss the appeal, with costs fixed, in accordance with the parties\u2019 agreement, at $5,000 all-inclusive.\n\u201cJ.B.

MAXINE COLLINS\nAppellant\nand\nTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\n(Delivered from the Bench at Ottawa, Ontario, on January 10, 2024).\nGOYETTE J.A.\n[1] The appellant appeals from an order of the Federal Court (per Fuhrer J) dismissing her motions: 2023 FC 863.\n[2] The relevant facts are as follows.\n[3] On February 8, 2022, the appellant filed a statement of claim with the Federal Court, alleging that employees of Canada Post were interfering with her mail, in violation of sections 48 and 49 of the Canada Post Corporation Act, R.S.C. 1985 c. C-10. The appellant\u2019s action came within the regime for simplified actions provided for in Rules 292 to 299.42 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106 (Rules).\n[4] The respondent did not file a statement of defence. Instead, on March 11, 2022, the respondent filed a motion to strike the appellant\u2019s statement of claim pursuant to Rule 221.\n[5] On April 21, 2023, Associate Judge Molgat (Associate Judge) dismissed the respondent\u2019s motion to strike because (1) the motion was brought out of time, and (2) the respondent had failed to file material necessary for the hearing of the motion.\n[6] The appellant appealed the Associate Judge\u2019s decision to a judge of the Federal Court through a Rule 51 motion. Previously, the appellant had filed a Rule 210 motion seeking default judgment against the respondent for having failed to file a statement of defence. The Federal Court dismissed both these motions.\n[7] The Federal Court exercised its discretion conferred under Rule 210 to dismiss the appellant\u2019s motion for default judgment for two reasons. First, the appellant had failed to provide any supporting evidence as required by Rule 210(3). The Federal Court found that the appellant\u2019s affidavit of service did not qualify as supporting evidence, that is, evidence supporting her statement of claim: Trimble Solutions Corporation v. Quantum Dynamics Inc., 2021 FC 63 at para. 35; Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Verdegem, 2013 FC 50 at para. 2. Second, the respondent had shown interest in the matter.\n[8] As mentioned, a decision on a Rule 210 motion is discretionary. Accordingly, this Court\u2019s intervention is justified only if the Federal Court made an error of law, an error on an extricable question of law, or a palpable and overriding error on a factually suffused question of fact or mixed fact and law: Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, 2016 FCA 215 at paras. 66-69; Canada v. Preston, 2023 FCA 178 at para. 12. We have carefully reviewed the appellant\u2019s arguments as well as the record, and we have found no such errors. Thus, we disagree with the appellant that the Rules prevented the respondent from filing a motion to strike her statement of claim. As for the conflict between the Federal Court\u2019s reasons and the order, paragraph 11 makes it clear that the dismissal of the motion for default judgment is without prejudice to the appellant\u2019s right to bring a further motion for default judgment with proper supporting affidavit evidence. In our view, the Federal Court\u2019s order should be read as implementing paragraph 11.\n[9] We now turn to the appellant\u2019s Rule 51 motion appealing the Associate Judge\u2019s decision to dismiss the respondent\u2019s motion to strike. The Federal Court noted that it could only intervene if the Associate Judge had made an error of law or a palpable and overriding error on a question of fact or mixed fact and law. The Federal Court rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that the Associate Judge had made such an error by rendering her order following Rule 298(2)(b) instead of Rule 221. According to the Federal Court, the wording of the Associate Judge\u2019s order made it clear that it was addressing the respondent\u2019s motion brought pursuant to Rule 221. The Federal Court also determined that the Associate Judge\u2019s consideration of Rule 298 was appropriate as this Rule provides limitations with respect to motions to strike on simplified actions such as the appellant\u2019s.\n[10] Before this Court, the appellant raises numerous allegations concerning the proper interpretation of Rules 221 and 298 and the interaction between these two Rules. After careful consideration of these allegations, we find that they do not support the conclusion that the Federal Court made a reversible error: Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at paras. 6-37.\n[11] As acknowledged in Sa\u2019d v. Yew, 2023 FC 1286, there is a difference between motions to strike pleadings that rely on the ground in Rule 221(1)(a) and those that rely on the grounds in Rule 221(1)(b) to (f). However, this difference has no impact on the outcome of this case. The fact that Rules 221(1)(a) and 298(2) required the respondent to bring his motion to strike the appellant\u2019s statement of claim on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action within the time set in Rule 204, while Rules 221(1)(b) to (f) and Rule 298(1) required him to bring his motion to strike based on other grounds at a pre-trial conference does not change the conclusion that the respondent\u2019s motion to strike was out of time and not accompanied by the necessary material. Either way, no error warrants this Court\u2019s intervention.\n[12] Before disposing of this appeal, we wish to note that the Appellant has not followed the proper procedural channels to raise a systemic discrimination claim. Therefore, this Court cannot rule on this claim.\n[13] For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\"Nathalie Goyette\"\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-160-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nR.

That order adjourned the oral hearing of the respondent\u2019s motion to quash the appellant\u2019s appeal, and ordered that the motion be determined based on written representations. That is, the Tax Court\u2019s order changed the oral hearing to a written hearing.\n[2] The Tax Court\u2019s order is discretionary, meaning that the Tax Court can decide. When an appellant appeals a discretionary order, such as this one, this Court reviews the order on the appellate standards from Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33: Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, 2016 FCA 215 at paras. 66, 79; Canada v. Preston, 2023 FCA 178 at para. 12. Accordingly, we can interfere with the Tax Court\u2019s order only if it made an error of law or a palpable and overriding error on a question of fact or mixed fact and law. A \u201cpalpable\u201d error is one that is obvious; an \u201coverriding error\u201d is an error that goes to the core of the outcome: Benhaim v. St-Germain, 2016 SCC 48 at para. 38, citing South Yukon Forest Corp. v. R., 2012 FCA 165 at para. 46.\n[3] The appellant says that, when it adjourned the hearing of the motion, the Tax Court could not order the motion to be determined based on written representations without his consent.\n[4] I disagree. The Tax Court did not err in changing the manner in which it would hear the motion.\n[5] The Tax Court scheduled an in-person hearing twice at the appellant\u2019s request. However, each time, the appellant asked for and was granted an adjournment because of medical conditions. After the first adjournment, the parties agreed to have the motion decided based on written representations. However, the appellant later changed his mind, seeking an oral hearing. While the Tax Court offered a hearing by teleconference, the appellant insisted on an in-person hearing. The Tax Court scheduled one, but again, at the appellant\u2019s request, the Tax Court adjourned it and issued the order under appeal, noting that the motion was suitable for decision based on written representations.\n[6] There is no right to an oral hearing for a motion. The Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure), SOR\/90-688a expressly permit motions to be determined based on written representations and without appearance of the parties in person: Rule 69. What is important is that the parties have an opportunity to put their submissions before the decision maker. Here, the parties previously made written submissions, and the Tax Court expressly invited them to file further written materials before it decided the motion.\n[7] Before us, the appellant said the Tax Court\u2019s decision to decide the motion in writing prejudiced him because his health conditions limit his ability to deal with written material.\n[8] Both the Tax Court and this Court have a duty to ensure that litigants with disabilities are accommodated, to ensure that they receive the same level of procedurally fair justice as that accorded to other Canadians: Haynes v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 158 at paras. 18-32. That said, individuals with disabilities have an obligation to help secure appropriate accommodation: Haynes at para. 30; Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970, 95 D.L.R. (4th) 577 at 994. There is no evidence before us that the appellant ever advised the Tax Court that it would be difficult for him to process and respond to, or to provide, written representations and other written material.\n[9] The Tax Court also has an obligation to act in a manner that secures the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every proceeding on its merits: Rule 4(1). When the Tax Court made its order, the respondent\u2019s motion had been before the Court for seven years. It merits a decision. Satisfied the motion was suitable to be decided in writing, and after repeated, but unsuccessful, efforts to hold an in-person hearing, the Tax Court\u2019s decision was well within its discretion. I see no error that would permit us to interfere with it.\n[10] At the hearing of this appeal, the respondent withdrew the request for costs. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal without costs.\n\"K.A. Siobhan Monaghan\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nJohn B. Laskin J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nAnne L.

Rule 334.39 provides as follows:\nNo costs\nSans d\u00e9pens\n334.39 (1) Subject to subsection (2), no costs may be awarded against any party to a motion for certification of a proceeding as a class proceeding, to a class proceeding or to an appeal arising from a class proceeding, unless\n334.39 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), les d\u00e9pens ne sont adjug\u00e9s contre une partie \u00e0 une requ\u00eate en vue de faire autoriser l\u2019instance comme recours collectif, \u00e0 un recours collectif ou \u00e0 un appel d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un recours collectif, que dans les cas suivants :\n(a) the conduct of the party unnecessarily lengthened the duration of the proceeding;\na) sa conduite a eu pour effet de prolonger inutilement la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019instance;\n(b) any step in the proceeding by the party was improper, vexatious or unnecessary or was taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution; or\nb) une mesure prise par elle au cours de l\u2019instance \u00e9tait inappropri\u00e9e, vexatoire ou inutile ou a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re n\u00e9gligente, par erreur ou avec trop de circonspection;\n(c) exceptional circumstances make it unjust to deprive the successful party of costs.\nc) des circonstances exceptionnelles font en sorte qu\u2019il serait injuste d\u2019en priver la partie qui a eu gain de cause.\nIndividual claims\nR\u00e9clamations individuelles\n(2) The Court has full discretion to award costs with respect to the determination of the individual claims of a class member.\n(2) La Cour a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019adjuger les d\u00e9pens qui sont li\u00e9s aux d\u00e9cisions portant sur les r\u00e9clamations individuelles de membres du groupe.\n[4] This Court did not consider Rule 334.39 in rendering the decisions on costs and it is open to us to reconsider that part of the judgments (and reasons) pursuant to subsection 397(2) of the Rules: Siddiqui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FCA 237 at paras. 20-21; Le Corre v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 238 at paras. 6-8.\n[5] The \u201cno costs\u201d regime applicable to class proceedings, while generally designed to assist plaintiffs in their access to justice, applies to all parties: Wenham v. Canada, 2020 FC 592 at para. 13, aff\u2019d 2021 FCA 208 at paras. 19-20.\n[6] Rule 334.39 applies as soon as parties to the action are made parties to a certification motion: Campbell v. Canada, 2012 FCA 45 at para. 45; Mohr v. National Hockey League, 2022 FCA 145 at para. 76.\n[7] The parties in this motion are parties to the Hudson certification motion, which was served on October 5, 2020. There is no certification motion in Pierrot v. Canada. Counsel agreed to hold the action in abeyance if Hudson proceeds and, accordingly, Pierrot has been stayed pending a final determination in Hudson: Canada v. Hudson, 2024 FCA 33 at para. 21.\n[8] Subsection 334.39(2) of the Rules is not relevant. Further, there is no reason to apply any of the exceptions contained in paragraphs (a) through (c) of subsection 334.39(1).\n[9] Rule 334.39(1) applies to the Hudson parties. While Rule 334.39(1) is not, strictly speaking, engaged in respect of the Pierrot parties, given the reasons for the matter being stayed, it would be inappropriate to depart from the \u201cno costs\u201d regime. Moreover, the plaintiffs in both Hudson and Pierrot did not mention costs in their submissions to this Court. Accordingly, none should be awarded: Chen v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FCA 170 at para. 60; Exeter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 FCA 134 at para. 12.\n[10] For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the motion, delete the words \u201cwith costs\u201d, and replace them with the words \u201cwithout costs\u201d in the Court\u2019s judgments and reasons (at paragraph 93), dated February 20, 2024.\n\u201cMonica Biringer\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nWebb J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nRennie J.A.\u201d\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKETS:\nA-16-23 and A-15-23\nDOCKET:\na-16-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING v.

Background [1] In the present appeal from a judgment of the Tax Court of Canada, the appellant moves for an Order that:\n1. The Court grant the appellant leave to adduce fresh evidence pursuant to Rule 351 of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106, as follows:\na. The appellant\u2019s personal tax returns and the respondent\u2019s assessments thereof for the relevant taxation years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011;\nb. The derivative corporate taxpayer\u2019s tax returns and the respondent\u2019s assessments thereof for the relevant taxation years 2007 and 2008;\nc. The letter of Dr. L. Raynor dated April 29, 2021;\nd. The medical certificate from Dr. L. Raynor dated April 21, 2011;\ne. The B.C. Minister of Finance document in the possession of the respondent\u2019s counsel which confirms that Factory Marine Distribution was, in fact, owned by Western Import Manufacturing Distribution Group Ltd.;\nf. Canada Revenue Agency circular T4001 (E) entitled Employers Guide - Payroll Deductions and Remittances;\ng. Canada Revenue Agency GST\/HST Policy Statement P-237;\nThe respondent amend and supplement the appeal book by including:\na. The transcripts of the Tax Court trial held on February 19, 2019, October 25, 2019 and March 22, 23 and 24, 2022;\nb. The omitted Tax Court Exhibits R-2 and R-3;\nc. All documents and exhibits provided to the court during Tax Court trial proceedings;\nd. Any or all of the documents that the Court deems admissible;\n3. The parties to this appeal be accorded a reasonable opportunity to amend their respective memoranda of fact and law accordingly;\n4. The appellant\u2019s previously disqualified court support person, Mr. Tinkham, be reinstated.\n[2] The respondents consents to the motion to the following extent:\n1. Including the Tax Court hearing transcripts and Exhibits R-2 and R-3 in a supplemental appeal book;\n2. Preparing the supplemental appeal book (while leaving the appellant responsible for ordering and paying for the transcripts); and\n3. Permitting the parties to amend their memoranda of fact and law.\n[3] The respondent opposes the introduction of fresh evidence, as well as the reinstatement of Mr. Tinkham. The respondent adds a request for an Order that regularizes the fact that a single notice of appeal was filed in respect of two different matters that were before the Tax Court.\n[4] I have also received and considered the appellant\u2019s reply to the respondent\u2019s submissions on the motion, as well as a letter requesting an extension of time to file an amended reply and permission to file an additional affidavit on this motion. I understand that letter request to be in response to an argument by the respondent that the appellant\u2019s affidavit #2 in support of her motion contains argument and irrelevant facts, and should be disregarded. Having considered this argument, I have concluded that the appellant\u2019s affidavit #2 should not be disregarded. To the extent that that affidavit contains argument, I will treat it is as such. Accordingly, I understand that there is no need to act on the appellant\u2019s letter request, and the motion is now ready to be decided.\n[5] Before examining the issues in dispute in this motion, a little background may be helpful. The Tax Court decision under appeal was rendered on May 30, 2022, and the notice of appeal was filed in this Court on June 30, 2022. Because of the lack of progress in the appeal by the following March, the Court sought input from the parties on advancing it. By Order dated May 12, 2023, having received and considered the parties\u2019 input, the Court put in place a timetable of steps in the appeal, and ordered the respondent to prepare the appeal book. The respondent prepared and filed the appeal book, but the appellant felt that some documents were missing. By Direction dated February 1, 2024, again noting the lack of progress in the appeal, the Court directed that, if the appellant felt any documents were missing from the appeal book, she should make a formal motion in that regard. This is the motion currently before the Court.\nII. Fresh Evidence [6] The parties agree that a party seeking to adduce fresh evidence must establish that the evidence: (1) could not have been adduced at trial with the exercise of due diligence; (2) is relevant in that it bears on a decisive or potentially decisive issue on appeal; (3) is credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief; and (4) is such that, if believed, could reasonably have affected the result in the court below; and that, if the evidence fails to meet the foregoing criteria, the Court still possesses a residual discretion to admit the evidence on appeal, though such discretion should be exercised sparingly and only in the clearest of cases, where the interests of justice so require (see Coady v. Canada (Royal Mounted Police), 2019 FCA 102 at para. 3).\n[7] The respondent argues that the proposed fresh evidence should be refused for the following reasons:\n1. In respect of the tax returns, the appellant and Mr. Tinkham were made aware of the importance of these documents during the evidence phase of the trial before the Tax Court, but made no attempt to introduce them into evidence until the stage of closing arguments;\n2. In respect of Dr. Raynor\u2019s letters (which appear to be dated April 21, 2011 and February 8, 2019), the Tax Court excluded them as inadmissible hearsay, and the appellant did not call Dr. Raynor as a witness; the respondent also argues that the February 8, 2019 letter lacks credibility in that it went beyond medical opinion into advocacy;\n3. In respect of the B.C. Minister of Finance document, it could have been adduced at trial with the exercise of due diligence;\n4. In respect of the CRA publications, these are authorities, not evidence.\n[8] The respondent argues that the appellant has not met the requirements for the introduction of any of the proposed fresh evidence, and this is not one of the clearest of cases where the Court should exercise its residual discretion in the interests of justice.\n[9] With regard to the tax returns, the appellant cites difficulties finding them. She adds that she attempted to adduce them as evidence prior to the commencement of closing arguments. With regard to Dr. Raynor\u2019s letters, the appellant argues that she was unable to call Dr. Raynor as a witness because she (Dr. Raynor) went on an extended vacation shortly after providing her February 8, 2019 letter, and then retired upon her return. The appellant also alleges that the Tax Court judge initially indicated that Dr. Raynor\u2019s letters could be introduced through the appellant\u2019s testimony. With regard to the B.C. Minister of Finance document, the appellant disagrees that it could have been adduced at trial with the exercise of due diligence. With regard to the CRA publications, the appellant appears to accept that she can refer to them as authorities rather than evidence.\n[10] I agree with the respondent that fresh evidence pursuant to Rule 351 should not be allowed. The appellant was aware of the importance of the tax returns and Dr. Raynor\u2019s letters and has not convinced me that she exercised due diligence in introducing them into evidence. She points to a trial exhibit as evidence of Dr. Raynor\u2019s vacation, but she does not point to any exchange with the Tax Court in which she asserted the necessity of relying on Dr. Raynor\u2019s letters as hearsay evidence because of her unavailability. The appellant also does not adequately document her allegation that the Tax Court initially indicated that she could introduce Dr. Raynor\u2019s letters through her testimony. Finally, I am also not convinced by the appellant\u2019s bald allegation that she could not have introduced the B.C. Minister of Finance document as evidence at trial with the exercise of due diligence.\n[11] Nevertheless, the appellant alleges in her notice of appeal that the Tax Court erred in refusing to accept at least the tax documents and Dr. Raynor\u2019s letters as evidence. In order for this Court to be in a position to determine whether the Tax Court erred in this respect, it will be necessary to have reference to these documents. Therefore, though they will not be accepted as fresh evidence, they should be included in the appeal book.\nIII. Supplemental Appeal Book [12] In view of the respondent\u2019s consent mentioned above, the only issue remaining in dispute in relation to the supplemental appeal book is the responsibility for ordering and paying for the transcripts. The respondent relies on the general rule that the appellant is responsible for arranging for the production of transcripts if necessary for the appeal. The respondent also notes that the appellant provides no support for her statement that she cannot afford to pay for the transcripts.\n[13] I agree with the respondent. The appellant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to convince me that she cannot afford to pay for the transcripts. In any case, I am not convinced that the respondent should be required to bear the cost of the transcripts to support the appellant\u2019s appeal.\n[14] However, it would appear that the appellant does not need transcripts. The website of the Tax Court indicates that audio recordings of hearings before that court are made available on request of a party for the purposes of appeal. Obtaining such recordings would avoid the high cost of transcripts.\n[15] I will order that the transcripts or audio recordings be included in the appeal book, but the appellant will remain responsible for obtaining them.\nIV. Amended Memoranda of Fact and Law [16] As indicated above, the parties agree that the parties should be allowed to submit amended memoranda of fact and law to reflect the content of the supplemental appeal book. That is appropriate. I will make a timetable for the exchange of amended memoranda of fact and law. That table will recognize the appellant\u2019s expressed concern about the limited time she was given for bringing the present motion.\n[17] At paragraph 46 of her written representations in support of the present motion, the appellant suggests that she might want an increase to the usual 30-page limit for memoranda of fact and law. However, she makes no argument in this regard, and I see no need to increase the page limit.\nV. Mr. Tinkham [18] The respondent opposes the reinstatement of Mr. Tinkham to represent the appellant in Court because this Court already refused this request in its Order dated May 12, 2023. In reply, the appellant simply disagrees.\n[19] I agree with the respondent that Mr. Tinkham should not be reinstated. The Court addressed this question in its Order dated May 12, 2023, and decided that Mr. Tinkham should not be allowed to make representations on behalf of the appellant at the hearing of this appeal. I see no reason to revisit that decision.\nVI. Consolidation [20] The respondent notes that a single notice of appeal was filed in respect of a Tax Court decision that addressed two proceedings in that court. The respondent argues therefore that the proceeding before this Court concerns two appeals, which should be consolidated as was done in Canada v. Microbjo Properties Inc., 2023 FCA 157 at para. 2 (Microbjo).\n[21] In my view, the circumstances in this appeal are distinguishable from those in Microbjo. There, a single set of reasons was prepared in respect of five distinct judgments for the five proceedings before that court. Five separate notices of appeal should have been filed to address the five judgments. Here, the Tax Court issued a single judgment in respect of the two Tax Court proceedings, which single judgment is the object of the present appeal. A single notice of appeal was appropriate in this case.\nVII. Conclusion [22] For the foregoing reasons, the appellant\u2019s motion will be granted in part. Neither party seeks an award of costs on this motion, and I will not award any\n\"George R.

C-42, against allegations of infringement of copyright and moral rights. Subsection 64(2) reads as follows:\n64(2) Where copyright subsists in a design applied to a useful article or in an artistic work from which the design is derived and, by or under the authority of any person who owns the copyright in Canada or who owns the copyright elsewhere,\n64(2) Ne constitue pas une violation du droit d\u2019auteur ou des droits moraux sur un dessin appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 un objet utilitaire, ou sur une oeuvre artistique dont le dessin est tir\u00e9, ni le fait de reproduire ce dessin, ou un dessin qui n\u2019en diff\u00e8re pas sensiblement, en r\u00e9alisant l\u2019objet ou toute reproduction graphique ou mat\u00e9rielle de celui-ci, ni le fait d\u2019accomplir avec un objet ainsi r\u00e9alis\u00e9, ou sa reproduction, un acte r\u00e9serv\u00e9 exclusivement au titulaire du droit, pourvu que l\u2019objet, de par l\u2019autorisation du titulaire \u2014 au Canada ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger \u2014 remplisse l\u2019une des conditions suivantes :\n(a) the article is reproduced in a quantity of more than fifty, or\na) \u00eatre reproduit \u00e0 plus de cinquante exemplaires;\n(b) where the article is a plate, engraving or cast, the article is used for producing more than fifty useful articles,\nb) s\u2019agissant d\u2019une planche, d\u2019une gravure ou d\u2019un moule, servir \u00e0 la production de plus de cinquante objets utilitaires.\nit shall not thereafter be an infringement of the copyright or the moral rights for anyone\n[BLANK]\n(c) to reproduce the design of the article or a design not differing substantially from the design of the article by\n[BLANK]\n(i) making the article, or\n[BLANK]\n(ii) making a drawing or other reproduction in any material form of the article, or\n[BLANK]\n(d) to do with an article, drawing or reproduction that is made as described in paragraph (c) anything that the owner of the copyright has the sole right to do with the design or artistic work in which the copyright subsists.\n[BLANK]\n[2] The principles applicable to statutory interpretation are well known, and have been discussed in many court decisions. The Supreme Court of Canada stated as follows in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653 at paras. 117\u201318:\nA court interpreting a statutory provision does so by applying the \u201cmodern principle\u201d of statutory interpretation, that is, that the words of a statute must be read \u201cin their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament\u201d: Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, and Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26, both quoting E. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87. Parliament and the provincial legislatures have also provided guidance by way of statutory rules that explicitly govern the interpretation of statutes and regulations: see, e.g., Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21.\nThis Court has adopted the \u201cmodern principle\u201d as the proper approach to statutory interpretation, because legislative intent can be understood only by reading the language chosen by the legislature in light of the purpose of the provision and the entire relevant context: [Sullivan Ruth, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes, 6th ed (Markham, Ont: LexisNexis, 2014 at 7\u20138).] Those who draft and enact statutes expect that questions about their meaning will be resolved by an analysis that has regard to the text, context and purpose\u2026\n[3] Statutory interpretation is a question of law and is to be reviewed on a standard of correctness in this appeal: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at para. 8 (Housen).\n[4] Based on statements and debates from around the time that subsection 64(2) was introduced into the Copyright Act, the broad purpose of this provision was to limit the scope of copyright and moral rights for designs applied to certain products that are reproduced in industrial quantities. Paragraphs 47 to 50 of the respondent\u2019s memorandum of fact and law cite some of these statements and debates. The general idea was that such designs should instead be protected by registration of an industrial design, which has a much shorter life than copyright.\n[5] However, the wording Parliament chose for subsection 64(2) is more nuanced than the broad purpose and general idea described above. Parliament did not simply provide that a design that is, or could be, the subject of an industrial design could not be enforced through the Copyright Act. In fact, that is essentially the approach the Copyright Act took prior to the introduction of subsection 64(2) in its current form: Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-30, s. 46. The text of subsection 64(2) does not simply state that there can be no copyright or moral rights infringement at all of a design that is contemplated therein. Rather, Parliament chose to exclude certain activities from infringement and carefully crafted wording both for the kinds of designs that are covered by subsection 64(2) and for the activities that are shielded thereby from infringement. The care with which subsection 64(2) was drafted is further demonstrated by the significant structural difference between the English and French versions of the provision. Despite this significant structural difference, I see no difference in substance between the two versions that is relevant to this appeal.\n[6] Subsection 64(2) contemplates \u201ca design applied to a useful article\u201d in which \u201ccopyright subsists\u201d, where that article has been \u201creproduced in a quantity of more than fifty\u201d \u201cby or under the authority of any person who owns the copyright.\u201d There is no dispute that the product in issue in this appeal meets these criteria.\n[7] Subsection 64(2) goes on to provide that it shall not be an infringement of copyright or moral rights for anyone to do the things indicated in paragraphs (c) and (d) thereof. This is where the dispute in this appeal lies.\n[8] This appeal concerns the Poppy Puppy, a plush toy created by the appellant, Leonard B. French, in 1998. Essentially, it represents a Dalmatian dog whose spots appear as poppies. The Poppy Puppy is the object of industrial design and copyright registrations in Canada. The industrial design registration, No. 97954, expired in 2013. Mr. French also obtained a design patent and a copyright registration in the United States in relation to the Poppy Puppy.\n[9] In 2003, Mr. French sold 150,000 units of the Poppy Puppy (in two sizes) to the respondent, the Royal Canadian Legion (Dominion Command) (the Legion). The Legion is an organization that advocates for veterans and their dependents, and sells Poppy and Legion branded items through its Legion Supply Catalogue and its website.\n[10] The Legion made no purchases of the Poppy Puppy from Mr. French after 2003. Many years later, in 2020, Mr. French became aware that the Poppy Puppy was still being advertised in the Legion Supply Catalogue, and with the following statement:\nThese toys have been [or \u201cThis toy has been\u201d] developed by the Legion to act as an aid in teaching children about the Poppy and the Poppy\u2019s role in Remembrance.\n[11] The Federal Court, in its decision under appeal (2023 FC 749, per Justice Michael D. Manson), found that this statement appeared in the Legion Supply Catalogue from 2004 until 2021 (see paragraph 52 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons).\n[12] In 2021, Mr. French commenced an action against the Legion in the Federal Court claiming infringement of copyright and moral rights in the Poppy Puppy. In support of his claim of copyright infringement, Mr. French alleged that the Legion had switched to an alternative supplier for the Poppy Puppy. However, the Federal Court found that there was no evidence to support this allegation. It also found that the copyright infringement claim was barred by a limitation period. Accordingly, Mr. French is not pursuing the copyright infringement claim in this appeal.\n[13] In support of his allegation of infringement of moral rights, Mr. French cited the statement in the Legion Supply Catalogue reproduced in paragraph 10 above, which he argued was a false claim of authorship of the Poppy Puppy. He argued that the statement infringed his right to be associated with his work as its author or to remain anonymous, as contemplated in subsection 14.1(1) of the Copyright Act.\n[14] The Federal Court found it unnecessary to decide the question of moral rights infringement because it found that any acts by the Legion that might otherwise have constituted infringement fell within subsection 64(2) of the Copyright Act, and hence avoided infringement. Despite this finding, the Federal Court was clearly concerned that the statement in question in the Legion Supply Catalogue was problematic. At paragraph 54 of its reasons, it stated:\nThere is a stark difference between remaining silent as to the authorship of a work and, as the Legion did, falsely claiming authorship of a work. There is no valid basis whatsoever for why the Legion claimed to have developed the Poppy Puppy itself, in place of the Plaintiff, whether the Plaintiff wanted to remain anonymous or not.\n[15] The dispute in this appeal concerns whether the Federal Court erred in finding that the Legion\u2019s activities fell within subsection 64(2) to avoid a finding of infringement of moral rights. Mr. French argues that subsection 64(2) is not applicable in the present case because the Legion\u2019s impugned action, making a false claim of authorship in the Legion Supply Catalogue, falls within neither paragraph (c) nor (d) of subsection 64(2). Unfortunately, the Federal Court provided little analysis to support its conclusion that subsection 64(2) applied. Its analysis in this regard focused mainly on whether the exception in subsection 64(3) applied to deny the Legion the benefit of subsection 64(2) (see paragraphs 27 to 35 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons). The Federal Court concluded that subsection 64(3) did not apply, and Mr. French also takes issue with that conclusion.\n[16] I will first address subsection 64(3). This provision reads as follows:\n64(3) Subsection (2) does not apply in respect of the copyright or the moral rights in an artistic work in so far as the work is used as or for\n64(3) Le paragraphe (2) ne s\u2019applique pas au droit d\u2019auteur ou aux droits moraux sur une oeuvre artistique dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle est utilis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des fins suivantes :\n(a) a graphic or photographic representation that is applied to the face of an article;\na) repr\u00e9sentations graphiques ou photographiques appliqu\u00e9es sur un objet;\n(b) a trademark or a representation thereof or a label;\nb) marques de commerce, ou leurs repr\u00e9sentations, ou \u00e9tiquettes;\n(c) material that has a woven or knitted pattern or that is suitable for piece goods or surface coverings or for making wearing apparel;\nc) mat\u00e9riel dont le motif est tiss\u00e9 ou tricot\u00e9 ou utilisable \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce ou comme rev\u00eatement ou v\u00eatement;\n(d) an architectural work that is a building or a model of a building;\nd) oeuvres architecturales qui sont des b\u00e2timents ou des mod\u00e8les ou maquettes de b\u00e2timents;\n(e) a representation of a real or fictitious being, event or place that is applied to an article as a feature of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament;\ne) repr\u00e9sentations d\u2019\u00eatres, de lieux ou de sc\u00e8nes r\u00e9els ou imaginaires pour donner une configuration, un motif ou un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9coratif \u00e0 un objet;\n(f) articles that are sold as a set, unless more than fifty sets are made; or\nf) objets vendus par ensembles, pourvu qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait pas plus de cinquante ensembles;\n(g) such other work or article as may be prescribed by regulation.\ng) autres oeuvres ou objets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s par r\u00e8glement.\n[17] Mr. French argues that the Federal Court should have found that subsection 64(3) applied to deny the Legion the benefit of subsection 64(2). Specifically, Mr. French argues that the Federal Court erred in stating that the design in issue was the Poppy Puppy as a whole rather than merely the pattern of poppies applied to it. Having made this error, Mr. French submits, the Federal Court failed to recognize that the case concerned an artistic work used as a graphic representation that is applied to the face of an article, as contemplated by paragraph 64(3)(a).\n[18] In my view, this argument cannot succeed. As noted by the Legion, Mr. French\u2019s position in this regard is new on appeal; he stated before the Federal Court in several ways that the design in question was the Poppy Puppy as a whole: see paragraphs 34 to 36 of the respondent\u2019s memorandum of fact and law.\n[19] Moreover, all of the copyright and design registrations obtained by Mr. French related to this case describe the Poppy Puppy toy itself rather than the poppies applied thereto. At the hearing of this appeal, Mr. French referred to drawings that are included in his United States design patent, and argued that dotted lines thereon indicate what is not intended to be part of the design, and that the design was limited to the poppies. I have carefully examined the drawings in question and have no doubt that Mr. French\u2019s argument in this regard must be rejected. The only dotted lines I see are to indicate stitching on the plush toy.\n[20] More importantly, the Federal Court\u2019s identification of the Poppy Puppy as a whole as being the object of Mr. French\u2019s copyright is a finding of mixed fact and law without an extricable question of law. Accordingly, this Court will defer to the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion unless we are convinced that it has made an error that is both palpable (obvious) and overriding (going to the very core of the outcome of the case): Housen at para 36; Benhaim v. St-Germain, 2016 SCC 48, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 352 at para. 38. I am not convinced that the Federal Court made such an error in this regard.\n[21] Aside from his argument concerning the application of subsection 64(3), Mr. French also argues that the Federal Court erroneously read subsection 64(2) as if any potential infringement of moral rights was contemplated therein. In fact, Mr. French argues, paragraph 64(2)(c) covers only reproduction of the design of the article in question either by making it or by making a drawing or other reproduction of it, and paragraph 64(2)(d) covers only doing with an article, drawing or reproduction that is made as described in paragraph (c) anything that the owner of the copyright has the sole right to do with the design or artistic work in question. Mr. French argues that paragraph (c) does not apply because of the Federal Court\u2019s findings that (i) the Legion had not found an alternative supplier for the Poppy Puppy (see paragraph 12 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons), and (ii) there was no evidence of copyright infringement (see paragraph 20 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons). Mr. French also argues that paragraph (d) likewise does not apply because that paragraph is limited to articles (as well as drawings and reproductions) that are made as described in paragraph (c), and it is acknowledged that there was no such article as described in paragraph (c).\n[22] The Legion\u2019s memorandum of fact and law does not respond to this point. The Legion does not dispute that the statement in the Legion Supply Catalogue was false, but it maintains that the defence of subsection 64(2) applies. It focuses on the reference in paragraph 64(2)(d) to the breadth of doing \u201cwith an article \u2026 anything that the owner of the copyright has the sole right to do\u201d.\n[23] At the hearing of this appeal, the Legion urged the Court to read paragraph 64(2)(d) such that the \u201cmade as described in paragraph (c)\u201d clause would apply to the \u201creproduction\u201d and\/or the \u201cdrawing\u201d mentioned in paragraph (d), but not to the \u201carticle\u201d. I do not read paragraph 64(2)(d) this way. In my view, it is clear that the reference to \u201can article, drawing or reproduction\u201d in paragraph (d) is intended to correspond to the \u201carticle\u201d mentioned in subparagraph 64(2)(c)(i) and the \u201cdrawing or other reproduction\u201d mentioned in subparagraph 64(2)(c)(ii). Accordingly, the \u201carticle\u201d mentioned in paragraph 64(2)(d) must have been \u201cmade as described in paragraph (c).\u201d\n[24] The Legion relies principally on the argument that subsection 64(2) is intended to be a full defence to a claim of infringement of copyright or moral rights, the reasoning being that one should not be allowed to enforce the same design as both an industrial design and a copyrighted work. In support of this argument, the Legion cites Magasins Greenberg Lt\u00e9e v. Import-Export Ren\u00e9 Derhy (Canada) Inc., [1995] F.C.J. No. 302, 61 C.P.R. (3d) 133 (F.C.T.D.) (Magasins Greenberg), and specifically paragraph 10 thereof. The Legion cites a quote therein from Hugues G. Richard et al., Canadian Copyright Act: Annotated, vol 3 (Toronto: Carswell, 1994) at 64-12, that provides as follows:\nBoth sections 64 and 64.1 set out a series of acts which, when the conditions of the appropriate subsections are met, are deemed not to constitute an infringement of copyright or moral right in certain designs or features applied to useful articles [emphasis in Magasins Greenberg]\n[25] This passage is of limited assistance in advancing the Legion\u2019s argument concerning the meaning of \u201cmade as described in paragraph (c)\u201d, since it explicitly recognizes that \u201cthe conditions of the appropriate subsections\u201d (subsection 64(2) in this case) must be met. It does not indicate what is necessary to meet those conditions.\n[26] The same paragraph 10 from Magasins Greenberg also provides a quote from Roger T. Hughes & Susan J. Peacock, eds, Hughes on Copyright and Industrial Design (Markham: Butterworths, 1994) at 573-31. This quote is notable because it does not explicitly recognize limits on the activities contemplated by subsection 64(2):\n\u2026 [W]here copyright otherwise subsists in a design applied to a \"useful article\" or an artistic work derived from that design and the owner or anyone authorized by the Canadian or a foreign owner of copyright makes fifty or more copies \u2026 then it is not an infringement to make that article or any drawing or other reproduction of the article or otherwise do what the copyright owner could do. [Emphasis added.]\n[27] Nevertheless, the words \u201cmade as described in paragraph (c)\u201d appear in paragraph 64(2)(d), and they must be given some meaning; Parliament does not speak in vain. There is little jurisprudence concerning subsection 64(2), and nothing directly on the point in dispute in this appeal. It is tempting to agree with Mr. French\u2019s argument that the wording of subsection 64(2) indicates an intention to limit the scope of the infringement exclusion to specific activities that are associated with the copyrighted design applied to an article or a drawing or other reproduction thereof. It is also tempting to agree with Mr. French that subsection 64(2) does not apply in this case because there is no evidence that the false statement in the Legion Supply Catalogue was associated with any reproduction of the Poppy Puppy. The appeal book does not include any copy of the Legion Supply Catalogue, so we cannot see how the statement was presented. Despite the Legion\u2019s assertion to the contrary, we cannot be sure that a photograph or other reproduction of the Poppy Puppy appeared in the Legion Supply Catalogue in association with the false statement. If it were otherwise, the Legion might be better placed to argue that the false statement was part of doing \u201cwith an article, drawing or reproduction that is made as described in paragraph (c)\u201d something that Mr. French, as owner of the copyright, had the sole right to do.\n[28] However, despite the allure of Mr. French\u2019s approach, I note that it would lead to a result in which the Legion would benefit from subsection 64(2) if it had reproduced the design, but not if it did not. Such a result would be absurd because it would benefit a party that had infringed both copyright (by reproducing the work) and moral rights (by falsely claiming authorship of the work), but not one who had infringed only moral rights. It is difficult to conceive that this was the intention of Parliament in enacting subsection 64(2).\n[29] Nevertheless, we still have the question as to what limits Parliament intended to place on the defence against infringement provided for in subsection 64(2). If the defence was intended to be available in respect of all acts of infringement, then presumably Parliament would not have chosen such detailed and careful wording. The answer to the limits that Parliament intended to place on the defence provided for in subsection 64(2) does not come from that provision. It comes from another provision of the Copyright Act, subsection 14.1(1), which defines an author\u2019s moral rights as follows:\n14.1 (1) The author of a work has, subject to section 28.2, the right to the integrity of the work and, in connection with an act mentioned in section 3, the right, where reasonable in the circumstances, to be associated with the work as its author by name or under a pseudonym and the right to remain anonymous.\n14.1 (1) L\u2019auteur d\u2019une oeuvre a le droit, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 28.2, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019oeuvre et, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tout acte mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 3, le droit, compte tenu des usages raisonnables, d\u2019en revendiquer, m\u00eame sous pseudonyme, la cr\u00e9ation, ainsi que le droit \u00e0 l\u2019anonymat.\n[30] Section 28.1 of the Copyright Act defines infringement of moral rights:\n28.1 Any act or omission that is contrary to any of the moral rights of the author of a work or of the performer of a performer\u2019s performance is, in the absence of the author\u2019s or performer\u2019s consent, an infringement of those rights.\n28.1 Constitue une violation des droits moraux de l\u2019auteur sur son oeuvre ou de l\u2019artiste-interpr\u00e8te sur sa prestation tout fait \u2014 acte ou omission \u2014 non autoris\u00e9 et contraire \u00e0 ceux-ci.\n[31] Subsection 14.1(1) contemplates two aspects of moral rights: integrity of the work and authorship. Only the authorship aspect is relevant in this appeal. The text relevant to authorship is limited to a right \u201cin connection with an act mentioned in section 3\u201d. Section 3 of the Copyright Act defines the rights associated with copyright, including the sole right to produce, reproduce, perform and publish the work, and to authorize any of the foregoing activities. The reference in subsection 14.1(1) to these rights ties an author\u2019s moral rights to copyright in the work in much the same way that subsection 64(2) is tied to a use of copyright. This suggests that the defence to infringement of moral rights provided for in subsection 64(2), including paragraph 64(2)(d), is intended to cover any infringement of the author\u2019s moral rights. For there to be an infringement of moral rights, it must be in connection with the copyright; if there is no act in connection with copyright, there is no infringement of moral rights. Though it is not binding on this Court, I note that a similar view of the law was expressed in Dolmage v. Erskine, 23 C.P.R. (4th) 495, [2003] O.J. No. 161 at paras. 77\u201380 (Ont. Sup. Ct., Sm. Cl. Div.). This interpretation of subsection 64(2) and the scope of moral rights is also consistent with the broad purpose and general idea of subsection 64(2) as described in paragraph 4 above.\n[32] Given the limited scope of moral rights contemplated in subsection 14.1(1), I cannot see how the false statement by the Legion concerning authorship could fall outside paragraph 64(2)(d) as Mr. French argues (because it was not associated with a reproduction of the design of the Poppy Puppy), and yet still be an infringement of moral rights. Either paragraph 64(2)(d) benefits the Legion as a defence to infringement of moral rights (if the false statement was associated with a reproduction of the Poppy Puppy), or there was no infringement of moral rights in the first place (because the false statement was not associated with a reproduction of the Poppy Puppy). Either way, the Legion is not liable for infringement of Mr. French\u2019s moral rights. It is not necessary to decide whether a reproduction of the Poppy Puppy actually appeared in the Legion Supply Catalogue.\n[33] Though the Federal Court\u2019s analysis of the application of subsection 64(2) in this case was insufficient, it is my view that it made no reviewable error in dismissing Mr. French\u2019s claim of infringement of moral rights.\n[34] For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss this appeal.\n[35] Because the Legion has requested the right to make submissions on costs after the decision on the merits, I would not decide the question of costs at this time. Instead, I would provide a timetable for submissions on costs.\n\"George R.

In its reports, the Commissioner concluded that the Lobbyists\u2019 Code of Conduct (former Code), developed pursuant to subsection 10.2(1) of the Lobbying Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. 44 (4th Supp.), was not breached by two registered lobbyists.\n[2] Specifically, the Commissioner was tasked with determining whether the registered lobbyists had breached Rules 6 and 9 of the former Code\u2013which related to conflicts of interest\u2013by attempting to lobby the then Minister of International Trade after having conducted political activities on her behalf. The appellant alleges that the Federal Court erred by finding that the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation and application of Rules 6 and 9 of the former Code were reasonable.\n[3] It is noteworthy that a new version of the former Code came into force on July 1, 2023, (current Code).\n[4] Namely, the current Code does not contain former Rules 6 and 9. In fact, they no longer exist. Current Rule 4.3 replaces former Rule 6 and current Rule 4.2 replaces former Rule 9 (see Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying of Canada, Renewing the Lobbyists\u2019 Code of Conduct\u2013Updated standards for ethical and transparent lobbying (Ottawa: OCLC, 2022) at 15\u201318).\n[5] Given the coming into force of the current Code, this Court must now determine whether the appellant\u2019s appeal has become moot and, if so, whether it should exercise its discretion to hear it. A matter becomes moot when there is no longer a live controversy affecting the rights of the parties (Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), 57 D.L.R. (4th) 231, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342 at 353 (Borowski)). A court must consider the following criteria when deciding to exercise its discretion to hear a moot matter: (i) whether there exists an adversarial context; (ii) whether deciding the matter would result in a waste of judicial resources; and (iii) whether the Court would exceed its proper role by deciding the issue (Borowski at 358\u201363).\n[6] It is apparent that no live controversy exists in this case. The appellant acknowledged that it is not pursuing this appeal with the objective of finding the registered lobbyists in contravention of the former Code, but rather to seek guidance, \u201cgoing forward\u201d, on the interpretation of specific expressions contained in the former Code (Memorandum of fact and law of the Appellant at para. 8). Although the appellant contends that some expressions contained in the former Code also appear in the current Code, their meaning remains to be informed by the entirety of the new text of the Sections or Rules of the current Code in which they appear. Hence, considering that: (i) the former Code, which contextualized these expressions, no longer exists; (ii) the issues that were before the Commissioner will not arise in the same way under the current Code; and (iii) the current Code was not before the Commissioner nor before the Federal Court, no live issue remains between the parties. This Court has consistently held that a \u201cmere jurisprudential interest fails to satisfy the need for a concrete and tangible controversy\u201d (Canadian Union of Public Employees (Air Canada Component) v. Air Canada, 2021 FCA 67 at para. 7; see also Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 90; Peckford v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 219). We are therefore of the view that this appeal is moot.\n[7] Neither has the appellant convinced us that we should exercise our discretion to hear the appeal. A weighing of the Borowski factors strongly opposes the hearing of the appeal as it would result in a waste of judicial resources and offend the principle of judicial economy. Further, the appellant has not persuaded us that the issues raised are elusive of review. It would be inappropriate for the Court to rule on the interpretation of expressions and rules contained in the former Code. Should these issues arise again; the appellant will have the opportunity to challenge the interpretation of these expressions in the context of the current Code and the Commissioner will provide its interpretation. In sum, the appellant is asking our Court to provide a legal opinion in the abstract, which is not our role, as ruling on these issues in the absence of a live controversy would lead the Court to overstep its adjudicative role.\n[8] Finally, the appellant challenges the Federal Court\u2019s award of costs on the basis that it was acting in the public interest and that it did not seek its own costs. However, the appellant\u2019s public interest standing does not provide immunity from costs and, consequently, did not preclude the Federal Court from rendering a cost award. The appellant has not convinced us that, in the circumstances of this case, the Federal Court erred in its discretionary decision to award costs. Our intervention is not warranted.\n[9] The appeal will therefore be dismissed, with costs payable to the respondent.\n\"Richard Boivin\"\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-181-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nDEMOCRACY WATCH v.

We agree with the Federal Court\u2019s dismissal of the application, substantially for the reasons it gave on the reasonableness of the Minister\u2019s interpretation and application of subsection C.08.004.1(1).\n[3] In particular, we agree with the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, effective in July 2020, does not displace this Court\u2019s previous interpretation of subsection C.08.004.1(1): Takeda Canada Inc. v. Canada (Health), 2013 FCA 13, [2014] 3 F.C.R. 70 and Janssen Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 137. Since the Agreement, the wording of the definition of \u201cinnovative drug\u201d in subsection C.08.004.1(1) has not changed. Thus, our two previous cases bind us: R. v. Sullivan, 2022 SCC 19, 472 D.L.R. (4th) 521; Miller v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 FCA 370, 220 D.L.R. (4th) 149. Accordingly, the interpretation of subsection C.08.004.1(1) adopted by the Minister in this case with substantial reasons offered in support remains reasonable.\n[4] It is trite that while international treaties can form part of the context relevant to the adoption of legislation, they do not amend legislation: Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada. v. Entertainment Software Association, 2022 SCC 30, 471 D.L.R. (4th) 391. For good measure, section 3 of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement Implementation Act, S.C. 2020, c. 1 provides that the Agreement is to be used to interpret legislation, not amend it. And subsection 30(3) of the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-27 empowers the Governor in Council to make regulations bringing the Agreement into effect, but as far as subsection C.08.004.1(1) is concerned, it has not made any change. While subsection C.08.004.1(2) provides that the purpose of section C.08.004.1 is to implement articles 20.48 and 20.49 of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, it continues to provide that the section is to implement article 39 of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, 1869 U.N.T.S. 299, which supports the previous interpretation of subsection C.08.004.1(1).\n[5] If the unchanged, specific wording of subsection C.08.004.1(1), as interpreted by this Court, does not conform with the Agreement, other legal and political recourses may be available. In this regard, we underscore our agreement with paragraph 54 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons. We add that any vires challenge cannot be inserted into this proceeding at this late time, as the notice of appeal purports to do. Rather, it must be brought in a new proceeding with an evidentiary record developed for that purpose.\n[6] As for Janssen\u2019s submission that the Minister unreasonably refused to reassess the data protection eligibility of the nasal spray, SPRAVATO, given our resolution of the interpretation issue, this issue is moot. Any reassessment would not have resulted in relief.\n[7] Therefore, we will dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at the agreed upon amount of $4,000.\n\u201cDavid Stratas\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-21-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nJANSSEN INC. v.

The Appeal Division, affirming a decision by the General Division delivered on November 7, 2022, held that the applicant was disqualified from receiving employment insurance benefits when he lost his job due to misconduct. He had failed to comply with his employer\u2019s COVID vaccination policy.\n[3] The applicant argued before both Divisions that he did not engage in misconduct on the job. Among other things, he focused on the validity of the employer\u2019s vaccination policy.\n[4] The Appeal Division rejected the applicant\u2019s argument. Following applicable court jurisprudence (e.g., Canada (Attorney General) v. McNamara, 2007 FCA 107 at paras. 22-23, Paradis v. Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 1282 at paras. 30-31 and Cecchetto v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 102), the Appeal Division held that the test for misconduct focuses on the employee\u2019s knowledge and actions, not on the employer\u2019s behaviour or the reasonableness of its work policies. It added that the applicant could pursue remedies elsewhere if he considered that his employer treated him improperly.\n[5] In our view, the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is reasonable. It is supported by the evidentiary record before it and applicable court jurisprudence.\n[6] We would add that the court jurisprudence makes sense. Were the applicant\u2019s submissions to be upheld, the Social Security Tribunal would become a forum to question employer policies and the validity of employment dismissals. Under any plausible reading of the legislation that governs the Tribunal, it is a forum to determine entitlement to social security benefits, not a forum to adjudicate allegations of wrongful dismissal. We note that the applicant in fact has pursued remedies elsewhere for wrongful dismissal and has made a human rights complaint.\n[7] Before both Divisions of the Social Security Tribunal, the applicant raised the Canadian Bill of Rights, S.C. 1960, c. 44. He raises it again here to suggest that his \u201cmisconduct\u201d did not legally constitute misconduct. Here again, as explained above, this submission is legally irrelevant to the Social Security Tribunal\u2019s task. Under its governing statute, the Social Security Tribunal cannot assess whether the applicant\u2019s dismissal from employment was wrongful.\n[8] In this Court, the applicant has raised the Charter in support of his claim. In the General Division, he raised Charter arguments but expressly withdrew them. Thus, his Charter arguments in this Court are a new, inadmissible issue: Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. Alberta Teachers\u2019 Association, 2011 SCC 61, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 654. We add that all Charter arguments, whether based on rights, freedoms or values must be supported by a rich evidentiary record, not by the \u201cunsupported hypotheses of enthusiastic counsel\u201d or judges: see the venerable, unquestioned case of Mackay v. Manitoba, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357, 61 D.L.R. (4th) 385 at 362. We do not have that sort of evidentiary record here.\n[9] Just a couple of weeks before the appeal hearing, the Supreme Court released its decision in Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest v. Northwest Territories (Education, Culture and Employment), 2023 SCC 31. In that decision, the Supreme Court held that decision-makers, at least in some circumstances, must take into account values resident in the Charter and that reviewing courts can consider them even where administrators have not considered them. Out of fairness to the applicant, we invited him to make submissions on whether the Tribunal should have taken into account any Charter values in this case.\n[10] The applicant submits that Charter values of \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d, as broad and unqualified as they are, should have been considered. He submits that the Appeal Division should have used \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d to whittle down or eradicate the vaccination requirements that were enforced against him. We reject this submission.\n[11] The text of the Charter and case law under it heavily qualifies \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d. And everything in the Charter is subject to reasonable limits prescribed by law under section 1. As well, it must also be remembered that section 1 of the Charter, in binding words that cannot be ignored, says that the Charter protects the \u201crights and freedoms set out in it\u201d, not other things such as \u201cvalues\u201d. Thus, the \u201cvalues\u201d that administrative decision-makers are to take into account cannot be broader than, undercut or do an end run around the established scope of the \u201crights and freedoms set out\u201d in the Charter determined in accordance with the seminal, binding Supreme Court authority of Quebec (Attorney General) v. 9147-0732 Qu\u00e9bec Inc., 2020 SCC 32, [2020] 3 S.C.R. 426. Undercutting the applicant\u2019s submission is the fact that there are no Charter cases recognizing a general, unqualified entitlement to \u201cfreedom\u201d or \u201cequality\u201d.\n[12] It is worth adding that under Commission scolaire, Charter values cannot be used to invalidate legislative provisions that administrative decision-makers must follow, such as, in this case, section 30 of the Employment Insurance Act. Only unjustified violations of rights and freedoms can strike down legislation. Here, as we have said, the Social Security Tribunal was reasonable in holding that the applicant was precluded under that section and related court jurisprudence from questioning the appropriateness of the termination of his employment.\n[13] The applicant also submits that he has been treated in a procedurally unfair manner. He focuses on the Social Security Tribunal receiving unsworn testimony. The Appeal Division answered this at paras. 15-16 of its decision, holding that it does have the power to receive unsworn testimony. We agree with this conclusion and the reasons offered by the Appeal Division.\n[14] The applicant is certain that he was wrongly dismissed. We sympathize with his plight but as a court of law we are bound to apply the law. As mentioned above, the law is that the Social Security Tribunal cannot delve into whether the dismissal was proper or the reasonableness of the employer\u2019s work policies that led to the dismissal.\n[15] We thank the applicant for the skill, organizational ability and eloquence he displayed in making his submissions.\n[16] Therefore, we will dismiss the application with costs.\n\u201cDavid Stratas\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-139-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nSKY SULLIVAN v.

It lies between Crooked Lake and Round Lake, the two most easterly lakes in the Qu\u2019Appelle Lakes chain. In 1887, the KFN adhered to Treaty No. 4.\n[2] In 1889, the respondent, whom I refer to as simply the Crown, set aside a fishing station on Crooked Lake as a Reserve, IR 72A, for the benefit of members of the KFN, whose primary Reserve, IR 72, was landlocked. IR 72 and IR 72A were confirmed by the same Order in Council, namely, P.C. 1151, issued on May 17, 1889.\n[3] In 1944, the Crown requested that the KFN consent to a surrender of a small portion of IR 72A for a road allowance requested by a local municipality. In response, KFN members told the Indian Agent with whom they were dealing that they wished to surrender the whole of IR 72A because they preferred to fish in Round Lake, which was close to the residential school their children had attended. They contemplated using the funds from the sale of IR 72A to purchase or lease a fishing station on Round Lake. There is no indication that the option of leasing as opposed to selling the lands comprising IR 72A was canvassed by the Crown with the KFN.\n[4] In 1944, the KFN surrendered all of IR 72A to the Crown for sale \u201cupon such terms as the Government \u2026 may deem most conducive to [the welfare of KFN members]\u201d.\n[5] However, the Crown did not sell the lands that comprised IR 72A until 1956. It then sold them via three tenders to a single purchaser, who operated a resort adjacent to the reserve. In so doing, the Crown did not consult with the KFN to confirm that it was still its wish to sell the land, nor did it confirm that the manner of sale reflected what the KFN wanted.\n[6] The Crown also did not consult with the KFN about how circumstances that affected the sale had changed significantly since the surrender. More specifically, in the years between 1944 and 1956, the residential school at Round Lake had been closed and cottage lots were being sold with increasing frequency in the area.\n[7] On October 5, 2013, the KFN filed a Declaration of Claim with the Specific Claims Tribunal (the Tribunal), seeking compensation in respect of several alleged failures by the Crown to fulfil its duties owed to the KFN with respect to IR 72A and its surrender. More specifically, the KFN claimed that the Crown:\nbreached the pre-surrender fiduciary duty owed to the KFN relating to the surrender of IR 72A;\nbreached the Indian Act,1927, R.S.C. 1927, c. 98 and Treaty No. 4 in respect of the surrender of IR 72A;\nbreached the post-surrender fiduciary duty owed to the KFN in respect of the lands surrendered, including by failing to have consulted with the KFN before making the sale and by failing to pursue the more advantageous option of leasing the lands as cottage lots;\nbreached its pre and post-surrender fiduciary duties related to trespass on the lands that comprised IR 72A; and\nbreached the duty to consult in respect of the 1909 construction of a dam at Craven, Saskatchewan, which impeded water flow into Crooked Lake.\n[8] In its decision in Kahkewistahaw First Nation v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2022 SCTC 5 (the Decision), the Tribunal made the following findings:\nThe Crown did not breach its pre-surrender fiduciary duty owed to the KFN relating to the 1944 surrender of IR 72A;\nThe Crown did not breach its duty under the Indian Act, 1927 owed to the KFN relating to the 1944 surrender of IR 72A;\nThe Crown did not breach its duty under Treaty No. 4 owed to the KFN relating to the 1944 surrender of IR 72A;\nThe Crown breached its post-surrender fiduciary duty owed to the KFN, but not to the full extent claimed by the KFN. The Tribunal held, among other things, that it was not a breach of fiduciary duty for the Crown to have failed to consult with the KFN before making the final sale more than twelve years after the surrender or to have neglected to pursue the potentially more advantageous option of leasing the lands as cottage lots;\nThe Crown breached its fiduciary duty owed to the KFN with respect to a pre-surrender trespass on IR 72A;\nThe Crown owed a fiduciary duty to the KFN with respect to a post-surrender trespass on IR 72A and breached such fiduciary duty; and\nThe Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear the asserted breach of the duty to consult and accommodate with respect to the construction of the Craven Dam.\n[9] The KFN has filed an application for judicial review with this Court, seeking to set aside the Decision in part. More specifically, the KFN asks this Court to overturn the Tribunal\u2019s finding regarding a pre-surrender fiduciary duty. It submits that the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the Crown did not breach the pre-surrender fiduciary duty owed to the KFN relating to the 1944 surrender of IR 72A was unreasonable. The KFN also seeks to have us expand the basis upon which the Crown should be found to have breached its post-surrender fiduciary duty owed to the KFN. It asserts that it was unreasonable for the Tribunal to have concluded that the Crown did not breach its post\u2011surrender fiduciary duty in failing to have consulted with the KFN before making the sale and by failing to pursue the option of leasing the lands.\n[10] As is more fully discussed in the Reasons that follow, I agree with the KFN that the Tribunal committed reviewable errors in respect of its consideration of the Crown\u2019s pre and post\u2011surrender breach of fiduciary duty. Thus, I would set aside the Tribunal\u2019s decision in part, with costs, and remit to it the issues of the Crown\u2019s breach of its pre and post-surrender fiduciary duties for redetermination in accordance with these Reasons.\nI. Relevant Factual Background [11] To put these issues into context, a little more background is required. In providing this context, I set out only those facts relevant to the issues before this Court.\n[12] As noted, IR 72A, a fishing station on Crooked Lake, was set aside in 1889 as a reserve for the benefit of the KFN, whose primary reserve was landlocked. Although originally intended to be somewhat larger, IR 72A was approximately 68.5 acres in size. It comprised lands located along the shoreline of Crooked Lake and adjacent lands extending back from the shoreline.\n[13] In 1924, the Crown transferred 2.64 acres of IR 72A to the province of Saskatchewan for construction of a roadway, but did not obtain a surrender of the lands in question from the KFN nor its consent to the transfer. It also provided no compensation to the KFN for the lands transferred to the Province. In addition, another road over the reserve lands was in use prior to 1944, without the consent of the KFN. This road provided access to Sunset Beach Resort, a waterfront resort adjacent to IR 72A, operated by the Criddle family.\n[14] In 1944, following a flood of the road to Sunset Beach caused by a dam built on Crooked Lake, the municipality of Grayson, Saskatchewan approached the federal government and requested that 1.5 acres of IR 72A be transferred to it for purposes of building a new road to Sunset Beach. This time, the Crown sought the consent of the KFN to a surrender of the portion of IR 72A required for the new road.\n[15] On February 1, 1944, the General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, Mr. Christianson, wrote to Crooked Lake Indian Agent Kerley, noting the latter\u2019s comment that the Chief of the KFN was in favour of granting the requested 1.5 acres and wished to take the matter up with the Band. Mr. Christianson stated in his letter that he had been in touch with Ottawa, which would approve the surrender of the 1.5 acres if the KFN were willing to surrender the land. He asked Agent Kerley to take up the issue with the Chief and Council of the KFN, and if they were willing, to take a surrender of 1.5 acres of IR 72A. In March of 1944, Agent Kerley was sent surrender forms for a surrender of 1.5 acres of IR 72A.\n[16] In early April 1944, Agent Kerley held a meeting with some members of the KFN to discuss the surrender. There were insufficient members of the KFN present at this meeting to authorize the surrender under the provisions of the Indian Act, 1927, so a second meeting was held later that same month.\n[17] In a letter that he sent back to the Indian Affairs Branch dated April 27, 1944, Agent Kerley stated that the Band had decided unanimously at the second meeting to surrender the entire fishing station. He explained that the KFN did not use IR 72A as most of them fished in Round Lake. He added that the KFN \u201c\u2026had in mind selling IR 72A and if possible leasing or purchasing a fishing station and camp near the Round Lake School as the majority of their children attended there\u201d.\n[18] At the time, the KFN had over $200,000.00 in the capital account maintained on its behalf, which appears to have far exceeded the cost of purchasing an equivalent amount of alternate land on Round Lake.\n[19] On May 3, 1944, Agent Kerley was sent surrender forms for the surrender of the entirety of IR 72A.\n[20] On July 8, 1944, Agent Kerley sent a letter to the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, in Ottawa, enclosing the completed surrender forms and reporting that he had obtained a surrender of all of IR 72A. The surrender forms were dated July 4, 1944 and were signed by the Chief and two Principal men of the KFN, whose signatures were witnessed by other members of the KFN. The surrender document read as follows in relevant part:\n\u2026 WE, the undersigned Chief and Principal men of Kahkewistahaw Indian Band resident on our Reserve Kahkewistahaw No. 72 in the Province of Saskatchewan and Dominion of Canada, for and acting on behalf of the whole people of our said Band in Council assembled, Do hereby release, remise, surrender, quit claim and yield up unto our Sovereign Lord the King, his Heirs and Successors forever, ALL AND SINGULAR, that certain parcel or trust of land and premises, situate, lying and being in the whole of Kahkewistahaw Indian Reserve No. 72A in the \u2026 Province of Saskatchewan containing by admeasurement 68.16 acres be the same more or less\u2026\nTO HAVE AND TO HOLD the same unto His said Majesty the King, his Heirs and Successors forever, in trust to sell the same to such person or persons, and upon such terms as the Government of the Dominion of Canada may deem most conducive to our Welfare and that of our people.\nAND upon further condition that all moneys received from the sale thereof, shall be credited to Band funds.\n[21] Enclosed with Agent Kerley\u2019s July 8, 1944 letter was also the list of voters for the meeting held on July 4, 1944, shortly following which the surrender documents were signed. That list shows that 25 of 43 eligible KFN members were present for the vote and that all but two of them had voted in favour of the surrender. Also enclosed was a July 8, 1944 affidavit signed by the Chief and two Principal men of the KFN, as well as Agent Kerley. In that affidavit, they affirmed, among other things, that the surrender had been accepted by a majority of the male members of the KFN who were 21 years or older and that their assent was given at a meeting summoned for that purpose.\n[22] The Crown accepted the surrender via Order in Council P.C. 6171, issued on August 7, 1944. Its text stated that the Crown accepted the surrender of the lands that formerly comprised IR 72A \u201cin order that the said lands may be sold on such terms as may be determined most conducive to the welfare of the Indians\u201d.\n[23] Shortly after the surrender was taken, there was an exchange of correspondence between D.J. Allan, who was employed as the Superintendent Reserves and Trusts, and General Superintendent Christianson regarding the surrendered lands. This exchange reveals that both expected that the surrendered lands abutting Crooked Lake would increase in value since there would be a greater demand for cottage lots after the war ended. Both expressed the view that greater returns might be realized if the lands were subdivided and sold as cottage lots than if they were sold in a block, via public tender, which was the usual manner of selling surrendered lands. In two letters, dated September 25, 1944, and October 17, 1944, General Superintendent Christianson stated that he felt that the government could get ten times the value out of the land by subdividing it in the future, rather than by selling it whole to Mrs. Criddle for the $500 she had offered.\n[24] Superintendent Allan further noted in an October 4, 1944 letter to General Superintendent Christianson that:\nOur experience has been that should such a subdivision be decided upon it is more profitable to rent the cottage sites than to attempt an outright sale of lake frontage lots. For example, it should be an easy matter to obtain an annual rental or $10.00 a lot, while to fix a sale price on the said lots as $100.00 a piece might be considered excessive, but the results in Indian revenue would be the same.\n[25] Following the surrender, the Municipality of Grayson built a road to access the Sunset Beach Resort in 1944 that cut across the former IR 72A lands close to the beach, thereby compromising their value as potential cottage lots. The lands on which the road was situated had not yet been conveyed by the Crown to the Municipality, and a dispute arose between the federal government and the Municipality over the location of the road. After much correspondence back and forth, the Municipality agreed in 1947 to relocate the road to its original position.\n[26] By 1944, lands in the area were beginning to be leased or sold as cottage lots. Certain reserve lands of the Sakimay First Nation, also abutting Crooked Lake, were beginning to be leased as cottage lots for the benefit of that First Nation. In addition, the Criddle family had subdivided their lands at Sunset Beach and, by 1945, had sold all but six of the 24 cottage lots on their lands. In subsequent years, cottage lots were surveyed and sold with increasing frequency in the area.\n[27] It appears that nothing was done by the Crown to further the sale of the surrendered former IR 72A lands between 1944 and 1953. No documentation was found relating to the sale of the lands over that period.\n[28] In July 1953, an individual acting on behalf of Mr. Criddle expressed an interest in purchasing the lands. On July 8, 1953, L.L. Brown, the new Superintendent, Reserves and Trusts, wrote to J.B.P. Ostrander, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, noting that he had received an inquiry from a friend of Mr. Criddle about purchasing the lands. Superintendent Brown thought the lands had not yet been surrendered and inquired if a surrender could be arranged.\n[29] In his reply letter of July 17, 1953, Regional Supervisor Ostrander stated that he had spoken to Agent Kerley, who was under the impression that the lands had already been surrendered. Regional Supervisor Ostrander also expressed the view that the lands should be offered for sale via public tender, as opposed to being sold privately to Mr. Criddle, as the tender process might lead to a higher price. He also wrote that he was of the view that the land should not be subdivided because this would cause delay, and the difference in the amount that the sale following subdivision might realize \u201cwould not be worth the trouble and expense\u201d.\n[30] Superintendent Brown replied on August 6, 1953 and confirmed that the lands had been surrendered. He stated as follows in his letter:\nWe now find that this Reserve was surrendered for sale in July, 1944, and the surrender was accepted by Order in Council P.C. 6171 dated August 4th, 1944. We are therefore in a position to proceed with the proposed sale without further reference to the Band.\n[31] The lands to be sold were subsequently surveyed at the request of the Crown and found to comprise approximately 65 acres. The lands were appraised in 1955 by the Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs as having a value of $1,920.00. At the direction of the Honourable J.W. Pickersgill, the then Minister, Department of Citizenship and Immigration, the lands were divided into three lots and offered for sale by public tender on November 2, 1955. The call for tenders expressly reserved the mine and mineral rights. Three offers were received; the highest was from Mr. Criddle, who offered $2,500.00 for all three parcels. His offer was accepted and a patent was issued to Mr. Criddle in June of 1956 for 64.36 acres of what was formerly IR 72A.\n[32] The KFN was not consulted about the manner of disposition of the lands, save to obtain its concurrence to bearing the costs for advertising the sale. Nor was it asked whether it still desired that the lands be sold.\n[33] By Band Council Resolution dated October 11, 1955, the KFN resolved that the costs for advertising the sale of the lands were to be paid from the revenue account of the Band.\n[34] Sometime between 1944 and 1954, the Round Lake Residential School closed. On September 21, 1954, by Band Council Resolution, the KFN decided to buy the former Round Lake Residential School lands for $10,000.00, resolving to lease these lands until they were needed by the KFN for farming purposes. These lands were purchased by the Crown on behalf of the KFN, and were added to IR 72 by Order in Council, dated November 10, 1960.\n[35] The experts who testified before the Tribunal on behalf of the KFN and the Crown agreed that the highest and best use of the portion of the lands that formerly comprised IR 72A contiguous to the shoreline would have been as a cottage lot subdivision, which would have yielded 42 waterfront lots. They further agreed that the highest and best use of the backlands would have been for agricultural purposes. They also agreed that, had the lands been leased for the benefit of the KFN, the revenue from leasing the lands between 1945 and 2018 would have been equivalent to nearly 4 million dollars in 2018.\nII. The Decision [36] I turn next to review the portions of the Decision relevant to the issues before this Court.\n[37] As concerns the alleged breach of pre-surrender fiduciary duties, the Tribunal focussed its discussion on whether the KFN\u2019s understanding of the terms of surrender was adequate and whether its decision to surrender the entirety of IR 72A was so foolish or improvident as to constitute exploitation.\n[38] The Tribunal commenced its discussion of these issues by quoting from the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in Southwind v. Canada, 2021 SCC 28, 459 D.L.R. (4th) 1 [Southwind] and Blueberry River Indian Band v. Canada (Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 344, 1995 CanLII 50 (SCC). The Tribunal then noted that it was required \u201c\u2026to strike [a] balance between the two pillars of autonomy and protection\u201d (at para. 47). It continued by stating that the KFN had the right to surrender the land and that its decision to do so was to be respected \u201c\u2026unless [its] understanding of the terms of surrender was inadequate or the decision to surrender IR 72A was so foolish or improvident that it constituted exploitation\u201d (at para. 47).\n[39] The Tribunal then moved to assess the adequacy of the KFN\u2019s understanding of the terms of surrender and concluded that the evidence did not support a conclusion that such understanding was inadequate. The Tribunal noted that the surrender documents were signed by the Chief and five members of the Band and clearly set out the nature of the surrender, stating that the lands were being surrendered for sale. Based largely on this fact and the fact that the impetus for the surrender of the whole of IR 72A came from the KFN, the Tribunal concluded that the KFN\u2019s understanding of the terms of surrender was not inadequate.\n[40] In terms of the contrary arguments advanced by the KFN, the Tribunal gave little weight to the fact that certain members of the KFN continued to fish in Crooked Lake after 1944 or to the fact that the KFN had adequate funds in the capital account to purchase those lands it wished to purchase on Round Lake. The Tribunal inferred that the Chief and Council would have been aware of the amount in the capital account. The Tribunal thus concluded that the amount of the funds on deposit in that account did not evidence an inadequate understanding of the terms of surrender, which were plainly set out in the documents that were signed by the Chief and members of the KFN.\n[41] The Tribunal also gave little weight to the opinions of Superintendent Allan and General Superintendent Christianson, set out in their letters regarding the most profitable way of proceeding, holding that their letters \u201c\u2026 speak only to their opinions at the time of writing and not an inadequate understanding by the [KFN] of the terms of the surrender\u201d (at para. 48).\n[42] Despite concluding that the evidence did not demonstrate an inadequate understanding by the members of the KFN of the terms of surrender, the Tribunal was critical of the Crown\u2019s conduct in taking the surrender. It wrote as follows at paragraph 49 of the Decision:\nStill, it is difficult to consider the facts surrounding the pre-surrender without concluding that the Crown could have better guided Kahkewistahaw when they decided that they wished to sell all of IR 72A. It could have investigated the land around Round Lake to determine availability and cost and inform Kahkewistahaw of its findings, considering the money in Kahkewistahaw\u2019s capital account. The Crown ultimately did not offer Kahkewistahaw lands on Round Lake to purchase until 1953 and the purchase price was a small fraction of the amount in their capital account at the time of surrender. The Crown could have informed and discussed leasing with the Claimant as an alternative to selling the land, pre-surrender. The Crown\u2019s pre-surrender fiduciary obligation, however, is one of \u201cordinary diligence\u201d to avoid an exploitative bargain.\n[43] After discussing the adequacy of the KFN\u2019s understanding of the terms of surrender, the Tribunal assessed whether its terms were foolish or improvident. The Tribunal compared the situation to that in Blueberry River and Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada, 2002 SCC 79, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 245 [Wewaykum], where the First Nations involved were found to have possessed good reasons for decisions they made: see Decision at paras. 49-50. The Tribunal reasoned that the KFN also had similar reasons in the case at bar, which were \u201c\u2026 grounded in reflection evidenced by a clear explanation why land near Round Lake would be more suitable to the members\u201d: see para. 51. It therefore held that the surrender was not so foolish or improvident as to constitute exploitation.\n[44] The Tribunal concluded as follows concerning the alleged pre-surrender breach of fiduciary duty: \u201c[w]hile the Crown could have communicated further details to the [KFN] at the time they expressed their desire to sell IR 72A, its failure to do so falls short of breaching its pre-surrender fiduciary obligation to avoid an unconscionable bargain\u201d: see para. 51.\n[45] Turning to the claimed post-surrender breach of fiduciary duty, the Crown conceded that the delay in selling the surrendered lands between 1948 and 1953, during which there was no movement to sell the lands, amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty: Decision at para. 101. The Tribunal also held that the Crown breached its fiduciary duty over the period from 1944 to 1947 by failing to exercise reasonable diligence to source revenue for the surrendered lands or to make an effort to sell them: Decision at para. 106. The Tribunal further held that the Crown breached its post-surrender fiduciary duty by failing to assess whether it would have been more profitable to subdivide the lands before the sale, particularly as there was a steady sale of cottage lots in the area between 1959 and 1967: see Decision at para. 111.\n[46] However, the Tribunal held that the Crown had no duty to consider leasing the lands on behalf of the KFN because the terms of surrender provided that the lands were surrendered for sale: see Decision at para. 107.\n[47] The Tribunal also held that the Crown did not breach its duty to consult the KFN about the sale before the lands were eventually sold, because delay, in and of itself, does not give rise to such a duty: see Decision at para. 113.\nIII. Analysis\n[48] I turn now to address the arguments the KFN advanced before this Court.\nA. Standard of Review [49] I commence by noting that the standard of review that we are to apply to the Decision is the deferential standard of reasonableness, as was held in by the Supreme Court of Canada in Williams Lake Indian Band v. Canada (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development), 2018 SCC 4, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 83 at para. 27 [Williams Lake 2018 SCC] and by this Court in Williams Lake First Nation v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 2021 FCA 30 [Williams Lake 2021 FCA], 458 D.L.R. (4th) 722 at para. 33; Witchekan Lake First Nation v. Canada, 2022 FCA 52, 2022 CarswellNat 7119 at para. 2; and Ahousaht First Nation v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 2021 FCA 135, 342 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 39847 (3 March 2022) at paras. 44-45 [Ahousaht].\n[50] In Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, 2019 SCC 65 (CanLII) [Vavilov], a majority of the Supreme Court underscored that a decision of an administrative decision-maker may be unreasonable either because of a failure of rationality in its reasoning process, where it gives reasons, or because the decision is untenable in light of the factual and legal constraints that bear on it: Vavilov, at para. 101.\n[51] As concerns the second possibility, the majority noted that the requisite inquiry is contextual. The Court provided a non-exhaustive list of contextual factors that may constrain an administrative decision maker. Those include the relevant common law precedents, precedents from the administrative decision maker, itself, and the evidence before the decision-maker.\n[52] With respect to common law precedents from the courts, the majority held that, provided adequate explanations are given, an administrative decision-maker may sometimes decline to follow a decision from the courts, depending on the circumstances. More specifically, at paragraphs 112-113 of Vavilov, the majority stated:\nAny precedents on the issue before the administrative decision maker or on a similar issue will act as a constraint on what the decision maker can reasonably decide. An administrative body\u2019s decision may be unreasonable on the basis that the body failed to explain or justify a departure from a binding precedent in which the same provision had been interpreted. Where, for example, there is a relevant case in which a court considered a statutory provision, it would be unreasonable for an administrative decision maker to interpret or apply the provision without regard to that precedent. The decision maker would have to be able to explain why a different interpretation is preferable by, for example, explaining why the court\u2019s interpretation does not work in the administrative context: M. Biddulph, \u201cRethinking the Ramification of Reasonableness Review: Stare Decisis and Reasonableness Review on Questions of Law\u201d (2018), 56 Alta. L.R. 119, at p. 146. There may be circumstances in which it is quite simply unreasonable for an administrative decision maker to fail to apply or interpret a statutory provision in accordance with a binding precedent. For instance, where an immigration tribunal is required to determine whether an applicant\u2019s act would constitute a criminal offence under Canadian law (see, e.g., Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, ss.35-37), it would clearly not be reasonable for the tribunal to adopt an interpretation of a criminal law provision that is inconsistent with how Canadian criminal courts have interpreted it.\nThat being said, administrative decision makers will not necessarily be required to apply equitable and common law principles in the same manner as courts in order for their decisions to be reasonable. For example, it may be reasonable for a decision maker to adapt a common law or equitable doctrine to its administrative context: see Nor-Man Regional Health Authority, at paras. 5-6, 44-45, 52, 54 and 60. Conversely, a decision maker that rigidly applies a common law doctrine without adapting it to the relevant administrative context may be acting unreasonably: see Delta Air Lines, at paras. 16-17 and 30. In short, whether an administrative decision maker has acted reasonably in adapting a legal or equitable doctrine involves a highly context-specific determination.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[53] With respect to a decision maker\u2019s own prior decisions, Vavilov recognizes that decision makers may enjoy greater latitude in departing from their own prior decisions, given the absence of stare decisis, but nonetheless must still provide adequate reasons for declining to follow the decision maker\u2019s own case law. As the majority stated at paragraphs 129 and 131:\nAdministrative decision makers are not bound by their previous decisions in the same sense that courts are bound by stare decisis. As this Court noted in Domtar, \u201ca lack of unanimity is the price to pay for the decision\u2011making freedom and independence\u201d given to administrative decision makers, and the mere fact that some conflict exists among an administrative body\u2019s decisions does not threaten the rule of law: p. 800. Nevertheless, administrative decision makers and reviewing courts alike must be concerned with the general consistency of administrative decisions. Those affected by administrative decisions are entitled to expect that like cases will generally be treated alike and that outcomes will not depend merely on the identity of the individual decision maker \u2014 expectations that do not evaporate simply because the parties are not before a judge.\n[\u2026]\nWhether a particular decision is consistent with the administrative body\u2019s past decisions is also a constraint that the reviewing court should consider when determining whether an administrative decision is reasonable. Where a decision maker does depart from longstanding practices or established internal authority, it bears the justificatory burden of explaining that departure in its reasons. If the decision maker does not satisfy this burden, the decision will be unreasonable. In this sense, the legitimate expectations of the parties help to determine both whether reasons are required and what those reasons must explain: Baker, at para. 26. We repeat that this does not mean administrative decision makers are bound by internal precedent in the same manner as courts. Rather, it means that a decision that departs from longstanding practices or established internal decisions will be reasonable if that departure is justified, thereby reducing the risk of arbitrariness, which would undermine public confidence in administrative decision makers and in the justice system as a whole.\n[54] As concerns the constraints imposed by the evidence before the decision maker, the majority found that it is axiomatic that a reviewing court may not second guess the factual findings of an administrative decision maker or re-weigh the evidence before the administrative decision maker. That said, the majority also recognized that a decision must nonetheless be justified in terms of the facts that were before the decision maker. More specifically, at paragraphs 125-126 of Vavilov, the majority found:\nIt is trite law that the decision maker may assess and evaluate the evidence before it and that, absent exceptional circumstances, a reviewing court will not interfere with its factual findings. The reviewing court must refrain from \u201creweighing and reassessing the evidence considered by the decision maker\u201d: CHRC, at para. 55; see also Khosa, at para. 64; Dr. Q, at paras. 41-42. Indeed, many of the same reasons that support an appellate court\u2019s deferring to a lower court\u2019s factual findings, including the need for judicial efficiency, the importance of preserving certainty and public confidence, and the relatively advantageous position of the first instance decision maker, apply equally in the context of judicial review: see Housen, at paras. 15-18; Dr. Q, at para. 38; Dunsmuir, at para. 53.\nThat being said, a reasonable decision is one that is justified in light of the facts: Dunsmuir, at para. 47. The decision maker must take the evidentiary record and the general factual matrix that bears on its decision into account, and its decision must be reasonable in light of them: see Southam, at para. 56. The reasonableness of a decision may be jeopardized where the decision maker has fundamentally misapprehended or failed to account for the evidence before it. In Baker, for example, the decision maker had relied on irrelevant stereotypes and failed to consider relevant evidence, which led to a conclusion that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias: para. 48. Moreover, the decision maker\u2019s approach would also have supported a finding that the decision was unreasonable on the basis that the decision maker showed that his conclusions were not based on the evidence that was actually before him: ibid.\n[55] In judicial review applications before the Federal Courts, paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-7 sets out the sets out both the grounds of review and the parameters of what reasonableness requires for review of factual errors: see Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa, 2009 SCC 12, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 339 at para. 46; Canada (Attorney General) v. Best Buy Canada Ltd., 2021 FCA 161, [2021] F.C.J. No. 848 (QL) at para. 103 [Best Buy].\n[56] Paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act uses terms very similar to those used by the Supreme Court of Canada in Vavilov to define unreasonable factual errors. Paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act provides that factual findings made by a federal administrative decision maker are subject to being set aside only if the decision maker has \u201cbased its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it.\u201d\n[57] As noted in Best Buy at paragraph 123 and Walls v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 47, [2022] F.C.J. No 399 (QL) at paragraph 41, this Court has held that the notion of perversity has been interpreted as wilfully going contrary to evidence, whereas the notions of capriciousness and factual findings being made without regard to the evidence include circumstances where there was no evidence to rationally support a finding or where the decision maker failed to reasonably account at all for critical evidence that ran counter to its findings (see also Page v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 169, 483 D.L.R. (4th) 742 at para. 79 and Brown v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 104, 2022 A.C.W.S. 2040 at para. 22).\n[58] While the test for setting aside a decision due to an unreasonable factual finding is an exacting one, reviewable factual errors do occur, and have, for example, resulted in decisions being set aside by this Court in Williams Lake 2021 FCA (an application for judicial review of a Tribunal decision); Canada (Attorney General) v. Fauteux, 2020 FCA 165, 329 A.C.W.S. (3d) 231; and Bergey v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FCA 30, [2017] F.C.J. No. 142.\nB. Is the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Pre-surrender and Post-Surrender Fiduciary Duty Unreasonable? [59] With this general background regarding reasonableness review in mind, I move on now to assess whether the Tribunal\u2019s treatment of the Crown\u2019s fiduciary obligations was reasonable. Having already reviewed the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on this issue, it is useful to next discuss the applicable common law precedents.\n(1) Precedents from the Courts [60] In Williams Lake 2018 SCC, the Supreme Court of Canada explained that there are two different ways in which a fiduciary obligation may arise between the Crown and Indigenous peoples. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Wagner stated as follows at paragraph 44:\nA fiduciary obligation may arise from the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples in two ways. First, it may arise from the Crown\u2019s discretionary control over a specific or cognizable Aboriginal interest: Manitoba Metis Federation, at paras. 49 and 51; Wewaykum, at paras. 79-83; Haida Nation, at para. 18; T.R., at para. 180-81. Because this obligation is specific to the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples, it has been characterized as a \u201csui generis\u201d fiduciary obligation: Wewaykum, at para. 78; Guerin, at p. 385; Sparrow, at p. 1108. Second, a fiduciary obligation may arise where the general conditions for a private law ad hoc fiduciary relationship are satisfied \u2014 that is, where the Crown has undertaken to exercise its discretionary control over a legal or substantial practical interest in the best interests of the alleged beneficiary: Manitoba Metis Federation, at para. 50; Alberta v. Elder Advocates of Alberta Society, 2011 SCC 24, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 261, at para. 36; T.R., at paras. 182 and 217.\n[61] As noted in Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 623 at paragraph 50 and Alberta v. Elder Advocates of Alberta Society, 2011 SCC 24, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 261 [Elder Advocates], at paragraph 36, a private law ad hoc fiduciary relationship requires that the following conditions be met:\n(1) an undertaking by the alleged fiduciary to act in the best interests of the alleged beneficiary or beneficiaries; (2) a defined person or class of persons vulnerable to a fiduciary\u2019s control (the beneficiary or beneficiaries); and (3) a legal or substantial practical interest of the beneficiary or beneficiaries that stands to be adversely affected by the alleged fiduciary\u2019s exercise of discretion or control.\n[62] The duties cast upon an ad hoc fiduciary are those of utmost loyalty and good faith, requiring the fiduciary to act in the best interests of the beneficiary and no other: see Elder Advocates at para. 43, citing Timothy G. Youdan, ed., Equity, Fiduciaries and Trusts (Royal Society of Canada, 1989) at p. 27; Williams Lake 2018 SCC at para. 165 (Brown J.\u2019s dissenting reasons). Given their multifaceted obligations and responsibilities, as was noted at para. 37 of Elder Advocates, governments will not owe private law duties of an ad hoc fiduciary in many circumstances.\n[63] The sui generis fiduciary duty owed to Indigenous people, on the other hand, has been held to exist whenever the Crown has discretionary control over a cognizable Aboriginal interest, and particularly with respect to the surrender and expropriation of reserve lands.\n[64] The sui generis fiduciary duty owed to Indigenous peoples in respect of surrendered reserve lands was first recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in Guerin v. The Queen, 1984 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335; Jack Woodward, Aboriginal Law in Canada (Proview) at \u00a7 3:57 at paras. 3.1300, 3.1310; Leonard I. Rotman \u201cConceptualizing Crown-Aboriginal Fiduciary Relations,\u201d in Law Commission of Canada, In Whom We Trust: A Forum on Fiduciary Relationships (Toronto: Irwin, 2002) at 26. There, the Court found that the Crown breached its fiduciary duty to the Band when it leased surrendered reserve lands on less favourable terms than were discussed with the Band and failed to disclose its inability to have the lessee agree to the terms discussed with the Band. Rather than proceeding to sign the lease, the Supreme Court held that the Crown ought to have instead disclosed to the Band its inability to obtain the terms discussed with the Band and should have sought new instructions before signing a lease. Even though the terms in issue were only discussed orally and were not incorporated into the terms of the surrender, the Court held that the Crown could not rely on the written terms contained in the formal surrender document. Writing for the majority in Guerin, Dickson J. (as he then was) stated at pp. 388-389:\nNonetheless, the Crown, in my view, was not empowered by the surrender document to ignore the oral terms which the Band understood would be embodied in the lease. The oral representations form the backdrop against which the Crown's conduct in discharging its fiduciary obligation must be measured. They inform and confine the field of discretion within which the Crown was free to act. After the Crown's agents had induced the Band to surrender its land on the understanding that the land would be leased on certain terms, it would be unconscionable to permit the Crown simply to ignore those terms. When the promised lease proved impossible to obtain, the Crown, instead of proceeding to lease the land on different, unfavourable terms, should have returned to the Band to explain what had occurred and seek the Band's counsel on how to proceed. The existence of such unconscionability is the key to a conclusion that the Crown breached its fiduciary duty. Equity will not countenance unconscionable behaviour in a fiduciary, whose duty is that of utmost loyalty to his principal.\n[65] In Blueberry River, the Band surrendered its mineral rights and reserve lands to the Crown to use the funds obtained to purchase alternate lands closer to its hunting grounds. The terms of the surrender for the mineral rights were for them to be leased and the terms of the surrender of the lands were for lease or sale. The Court found no breach of fiduciary duty in respect of the surrender because its terms were fully discussed and understood by the Band. Importantly, the option of leasing was shown to have been fully discussed with the Band. However, the Court went on to find a breach of fiduciary duty in respect of the Crown\u2019s failure to reserve the mineral rights in the eventual sale in circumstances where the Crown\u2019s usual practice was to reserve the mineral rights in all sales of Crown lands.\n[66] On the issue of the surrender, in her oft-cited concurring reasons, McLachlin J. (as she then was) noted that, while the Band had trusted the Crown to provide it with information as to its options and their foreseeable consequences, the Band had not abdicated its decision making power in respect of the surrender. In the circumstances, the Court found that the scope of the fiduciary duty owed by the Crown in respect of the surrender was limited to preventing an exploitative bargain as opposed to preventing the sale. The Band had argued that the Crown had an obligation to prevent the surrender in circumstances where, with the decline of hunting and trapping and the subsequent discovery of oil and gas on the former reserve, hindsight showed the decision to surrender to have been unfortunate. The Court rejected this contention. McLachlin J. noted at paragraph 35:\nMy view is that the Indian Act's provisions for surrender of band reserves strikes a balance between the two extremes of autonomy and protection. The band's consent was required to surrender its reserve. Without that consent the reserve could not be sold. But the Crown, through the Governor in Council, was also required to consent to the surrender. The purpose of the requirement of Crown consent was not to substitute the Crown's decision for that of the band, but to prevent exploitation. As Dickson J. characterized it in Guerin (at p. 383):\nThe purpose of this surrender requirement is clearly to interpose the Crown between the Indians and prospective purchasers or lessees of their land, so as to prevent the Indians from being exploited.\nIt follows that under the Indian Act, the Band had the right to decide whether to surrender the reserve, and its decision was to be respected. At the same time, if the Band's decision was foolish or improvident -- a decision that constituted exploitation -- the Crown could refuse to consent. In short, the Crown's obligation was limited to preventing exploitative bargains.\n[67] Gonthier J., who penned the majority reasons, noted that he would have been \u201creluctant to give effect\u201d to the surrender if he thought that the \u201cBand\u2019s understanding of its terms had been inadequate, or if the conduct of the Crown had somehow tainted the dealings in a manner which made it unsafe to rely on the Band\u2019s understanding and intention\u201d (at para. 14).\n[68] The failure to reserve the mineral rights, on the other hand, was found to be a breach of fiduciary duty because the Crown failed to exercise ordinary prudence when, through mistake, it neglected to follow its usual practice of reserving the mineral rights from the sale. In the words of McLachlin J. at paragraph 104:\nThe matter comes down to this. The duty on the Crown as fiduciary was \"that of a man of ordinary prudence in managing his own affairs\": Fales v. The Crown Permanent Trust Co., 1976 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1977] 2 S.C.R. 302, at p. 315. A reasonable person does not inadvertently give away a potentially valuable asset which has already demonstrated earning potential. Nor does a reasonable person give away for no consideration what it will cost him nothing to keep and which may one day possess value, however remote the possibility. The Crown managing its own affairs reserved out its minerals. It should have done the same for the Band.\n[69] Wewaykum also concerned reserve lands. There, the Supreme Court of Canada clarified that a fiduciary duty does not cover all aspects of the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples and does not necessarily arise before reserve creation: see para. 81. The Court held that, depending on the circumstances, a fiduciary relationship can arise prior to reserve creation, where its scope is limited to the obligations of good faith, providing full disclosure with respect to the subject matter, and acting with ordinary prudence. However, after a reserve is created, the scope of the Crown\u2019s obligations are expanded to include protection of Indigenous interests in reserve land from exploitative bargains: see paras. 98-99.\n[70] In Williams Lake 2018 SCC, Chief Justice Wagner, writing for a majority of the Supreme Court, described the scope of the sui generis fiduciary duty owed to Indigenous peoples, as developed through the case law, in the following terms at paragraph 46:\nA fiduciary obligation requires that the Crown\u2019s discretionary control be exercised in accordance with the standard of conduct to which equity holds a fiduciary (Guerin, at p. 384; Wewaykum, at para. 80). This is embodied, for example, in the fiduciary duties of loyalty, good faith and full disclosure. The standard of care to which a fiduciary is held in its pursuit of the beneficiary\u2019s interests is \u201cthat of a man of ordinary prudence in managing his own affairs\u201d: Blueberry River Indian Band v. Canada (Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 1995 CanLII 50 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 344, at para. 104 (McLachlin J., as she then was), citing Fales v. Canada Permanent Trust Co., 1976 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1977] 2 S.C.R. 302, at p. 315; Wewaykum, at para. 94.\n[71] In Southwind, the most recent decision of the Supreme Court concerning fiduciary duties owed to Indigenous peoples, Karakatsanis J., writing for the majority, described the nature of the ad hoc fiduciary duty owed by the Crown to Indigenous peoples with respect to reserve lands as follows at paragraphs 63-64:\nIn a case involving reserve land, the sui generis nature of the interest in reserve land informs the fiduciary duty. Reserve land is not a fungible commodity. Instead, reserve land reflects the essential relationship between Indigenous Peoples and the land. In Osoyoos, Iacobucci J. wrote that Aboriginal interests in land has an \u201cimportant cultural component that reflects the relationship between an aboriginal community and the land and the inherent and unique value in the land itself which is enjoyed by the community\u201d (para. 46). The importance of the interest in reserve land is heightened by the fact that, in many cases such as this one, the reserve land was set aside as part of an obligation that arose out of treaties between the Crown and Indigenous Peoples.\nThe fiduciary duty imposes the following obligations on the Crown: loyalty, good faith, full disclosure, and, where reserve land is involved, the protection and preservation of the First Nation\u2019s quasi-proprietary interest from exploitation (Williams Lake, at para. 46; Wewaykum, at para. 86). The standard of care is that of a person of ordinary prudence in managing their own affairs (Williams Lake, at para. 46). In the context of a surrender of reserve land, this Court has recognized that the duty also requires that the Crown protect against improvident bargains, manage the process to advance the best interests of the First Nation, and ensure that it consents to the surrender (Blueberry River Indian Band v. Canada (Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 1995 CanLII 50 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 344, at paras. 35 and 96). In an expropriation, the obligation to ensure consent is replaced by an obligation to minimally impair the protected interest (Osoyoos, at para. 54).\n[Emphasis added.]\n[72] In Southwind, the Supreme Court also underscored that a breaching fiduciary who fails to disclose material facts is prevented by what has been called the \u201cBrickenden rule\u201d from arguing that the outcome would have been the same regardless of whether the facts were disclosed, citing to Brickenden v. London Loan & Savings Co. [1934] 3 D.L.R. 465 (P.C.), 1934 CanLII 280 (UK JCPC) (at para. 82).\n[73] One other court decision merits mention, namely, the decision of our Court in Semiahmoo Indian Band v. Canada (C.A.), 148 D.L.R. (4th) 523, 1997 CanLII 6347 (FCA) [Semiahmoo]. There, this Court found a breach of fiduciary duty when the Crown requested the surrender of land to expand a customs facility without any definite plans to construct the facility. This Court upheld the trial judge\u2019s finding that the initial surrender as well as a failure to re-convey the land when the Band requested a re-conveyance were both breaches of fiduciary duty by the Crown. Importantly for our purposes, this Court confirmed that the Crown\u2019s post-surrender fiduciary obligations required it to consider and adjust to changed circumstances, which in that case, involved a request by the Band that the land be re-conveyed back to Band when it was no longer needed for the purposes it was surrendered.\n[74] From the foregoing cases, the following principles emerge of relevance to the instant case.\n[75] First, the nature of the sui generis fiduciary duty owed by the Crown to Indigenous peoples in the context of a surrender of reserve land is multifaceted. The obligations imposed on the Crown in such circumstances include duties of loyalty, good faith, full disclosure, protection of the First Nation\u2019s interest in the reserve lands from exploitative or improvident bargains, managing the process in the best interests of the First Nation, and ensuring that the First Nation consents to the surrender. These duties require decision makers tasked with assessing a claim of breach of fiduciary duty to consider factors that go well beyond the existence of consent by the First Nation and whether the bargain was improvident, the only two factors assessed by the Tribunal in the present case.\n[76] Second, the terms of the formal written surrender document are not determinative of the scope of the Crown\u2019s fiduciary obligations. Rather, the nature of those obligations will fall to be determined based on all the relevant surrounding circumstances. Sometimes those circumstances may require the Crown, in the discharge of its fiduciary obligations, to go beyond the terms contained in the surrender document and to explore other options.\n[77] Third, the Crown\u2019s post-surrender fiduciary obligations may require it to consider and adjust to changed circumstances relevant to the surrender where the surrendered land has not yet been sold. Depending on the facts, the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duties may require it to consult with the First Nation or re-convey to the First Nation lands that have been surrendered and not yet sold.\n(2) Precedents from the Tribunal [78] I turn next to briefly review relevant precedents from the Tribunal, itself.\n[79] The Tribunal has recognized many times that the obligations imposed on the Crown when reserve land is surrendered go beyond preventing exploitative bargains and accepting a surrender that the First Nation has consented to sign. These additional obligations include, among other things, the need for full disclosure to the First Nation by the Crown of all relevant facts that the Crown has knowledge of prior to taking the surrender: see e.g. Metlakatla Indian Band v. His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, 2022 SCTC 6 at paras. 186-189, 194 [Metlakatla]; Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2019 SCTC 5 at para. 144 [Makwa Sahgaiehcan]; Lac La Ronge Band and Montreal Lake Cree Nation v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2014 SCTC 8, aff\u2019d 2015 FCA 154 at para. 164.\n[80] In all of the foregoing cases, the Tribunal found the Crown breached the fiduciary duty it owed to Indigenous Peoples, in part because it failed to disclose or consult on facts the Crown had knowledge of that were relevant to the decision to surrender. As the Tribunal noted in Metlakatla, \u201cthe failure by Canada to offer disclosure of material facts to [a] Band\u201d is \u201ca failure to act with loyalty and good faith towards [that] Band\u201d: see para. 340.\n[81] Where there is a failure to disclose relevant facts, any consent given to the surrender is not an informed one, and therefore cannot be valid. This is because \u201cwhere actions are a matter of choice, the exercise of an actor\u2019s autonomous will depend on the actor\u2019s knowledge of the available choices\u201d: Makwa Sahgaiehcan, at para. 149.\n[82] Where appropriate disclosure has not been made, the Tribunal has held that the burden falls on the Crown to establish that the First Nation would have suffered the same loss regardless of the breach. In in Doig River First Nation and Blueberry River First Nations v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada 2018, SCTC 5, the Tribunal outlined the applicable principles as follows:\n[161] \u2026.Where the breach of duty includes a failure to inform the beneficiary about important aspects of the impugned transaction, the principle in Brickenden, as interpreted in Hodgkinson, applies. The Court in Brickenden at page 469 said:\nWhen a party, holding a fiduciary relationship, commits a breach of his duty by non-disclosure of material facts, which his constituent is entitled to know in connection with the transaction, he cannot be heard to maintain that disclosure would not have altered the decision to proceed with the transaction, because the constitutent\u2019s [sic] action would be solely determined by some other factor, such as the valuation by another party of the property proposed to be mortgaged. Once the Court has determined that the non-disclosure facts were material, speculation as to what course the constituent, on disclosure, would have taken is not relevant.\n[162] In Hodgkinson, the Supreme Court of Canada framed the principle in Brickenden as a reverse onus: \u201c\u2026the onus is on the defendant to prove that the innocent victim would have suffered the same loss regardless of the breach\u2026\u201d; the defendant must provide \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d; and, \u201cmere \u2018speculation\u2019\u201d is inadequate (Hodgkinson at para 76). The focus of the inquiry then is whether the ill-informed \u201cconstituent\u201d would have continued with the deal if properly informed.\n[83] The Tribunal has also found that where there is a change in circumstances relevant to a decision to surrender or to the sale of resources harvested from reserve lands, the Crown must consult with the First Nation before proceeding: see especially Doig River First Nation and Blueberry River First Nations v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2015 SCTC 6 at paras. 155, 168 [Doig River 2015]; Huu-Ay-Aht First Nations v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2014 SCTC 7 at paras. 72, 86-87, 104 [Huu-Ay-Aht].\n[84] As will soon become apparent, it is my view that the Tribunal\u2019s failure to recognize the foregoing principles drawn from the relevant court and Tribunal cases renders its decision in the case at bar unreasonable.\n(3) Reasonableness of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Pre-surrender Breach of Fiduciary Duty [85] I turn first to review in more detail the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the allegations of pre-surrender breach and find that it reached an unreasonable factual conclusion. This, in turn, led it to bypass consideration of the adequacy of the information the KFN had when it consented to the surrender of IR 72A and of the adequacy of disclosure made by the Crown to the KFN.\n[86] In this regard, it will be recalled that the Tribunal characterized what was said by two government officials in correspondence between them about the value of the surrendered lands as being merely the views of two individuals, which bore no relevance to the adequacy of the KFN\u2019s understanding of the terms of surrender. With respect, this characterization is so untenable that it meets the high bar of being unreasonable because it fails to reasonably account for critical evidence that runs counter to its findings. In the words used by the Supreme Court in Vavilov, the Tribunal fundamentally misapprehended the evidence before it.\n[87] Superintendent Allan and General Superintendent Christianson were not mere individuals, but, rather, were key officials employed in the very federal government department that was charged with responsibility for protecting the interests of Indigenous Peoples in Saskatchewan in their reserve lands. Moreover, in his October 4, 1944 letter to General Superintendent Christianson, Superintendent Allan stated that it had been \u201cour\u201d experience that leasing cottage lots was more profitable than selling them. His use of the pronoun \u201cour\u201d can only be understood as meaning that he was speaking of the collective experience of officials in the Department and not just his own experience. The timing of the letter is also significant. It was sent just months after the surrender was taken.\n[88] The knowledge of individuals acting for the Crown in these key roles that it was more profitable at the time to lease than sell lots that could be used for building cottages is highly relevant to the adequacy of the KFN\u2019s understanding of the terms of the surrender and to the adequacy of the Crown\u2019s disclosure to the KFN.\n[89] There is no suggestion that the Crown discussed the relative merits of leasing versus selling the IR 72A lands with the KFN before the surrender was taken by Agent Kerley. In the absence of any discussion by the Crown with the KFN of the comparative value of leasing versus sale of the IR 72A lands, it is impossible to conclude that the KFN had an adequate understanding of the terms of the surrender or that appropriate disclosure was made by the Crown.\n[90] As the applicant rightly notes, the lack of evidence that these facts were discussed with the KFN distinguishes this case from Blueberry River and reduces the requirement for an adequate understanding of the terms of the surrender to \u201clittle more than a question of whether the First Nation members were literate\u201d: see Applicant\u2019s Memorandum of Fact and Law at para. 46.\n[91] I therefore conclude that the unreasonable characterization of the correspondence between Superintendent Allan and General Superintendent Christianson led the Tribunal to commit a reviewable error.\n[92] In addition to the foregoing unreasonable factual determination, the Tribunal also failed to account for or to reconcile its decision in the present case with the long line of authority from the courts and the Tribunal, itself, holding that the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duties in cases of this nature include the requirement for full disclosure. The conclusions of the Tribunal in paragraphs 49 and 51 of the Decision, regarding the additional disclosures that could have been made by the Crown about the potential benefits of leasing, are incompatible with the authorities that require full disclosure by the Crown of relevant information when a surrender is taken.\n[93] I therefore conclude that the Tribunal\u2019s determination that there was no pre-surrender breach of fiduciary duty by the Crown was unreasonable.\n(4) Reasonableness of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Post-surrender Breach of Fiduciary Duty [94] I turn now to the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the post-surrender breach of fiduciary duty by the Crown.\n[95] The case law discussed above recognizes that changed circumstances affecting a decision to surrender, where the land in still owned by the Crown, typically require that the Crown consult with the First Nation and seek fresh instructions. As this Court held in Semiahmoo, \u201creasonable diligence\u201d requires that the [Crown] disclose\u2014and \u201cmove to correct\u201d\u2014any material facts that would affect a community\u2019s interests in the context of a surrender for sale. The Crown is remiss in meeting its post-fiduciary duties when it fails to do so (see para. 68). Investigation and disclosure are important in this context. Like this Court concluded in Semiahmoo, \u201chad the Crown moved with some degree of alacrity, the band could have benefitted from an earlier termination of what had turned out to be a bad deal for them\u201d (see para. 68, citing Lower Kootenay Indian Band v. Canada, [1992] 2 C.N.L.R. 54 (F.C.T.D.)).\n[96] The Tribunal came to similar conclusions in Doig River 2015at para. 167; and Huu-Ay-Aht at paras. 100, 104. In both cases, the Tribunal held that the Crown\u2019s failure to investigate and disclose the changed circumstances affecting surrendered lands prevented the Indigenous community involved from making an informed choice about its best interests.\n[97] It is clear from this line of jurisprudence that the Crown does not discharge its fiduciary duty by merely acting on the terms contained in the surrender document.\n[98] Contrary to the foregoing, the Tribunal in the instant case held that the Crown was not required to consider leasing the former IR 72A lands after the surrender was taken because the terms of the surrender were for sale. However, in the intervening years, during which the Crown failed to take any action on the matter, the reason that prompted the surrender in the first place may well have disappeared with the closure of the Round Lake Residential School. In addition, cottage development in the area was proceeding apace.\n[99] These were important changed circumstances that merited consideration by the Tribunal and assessment as to whether the Crown ought to have consulted with the KFN before proceeding with the sale and whether, in such consultations, the possibility of leasing ought to have been discussed. It was unreasonable for the Tribunal to have concluded that all that had transpired in the intervening years was the mere passage of time.\n[100] The Tribunal\u2019s characterization of the facts was therefore, once again, unreasonable. This characterization prevented it from assessing whether further consultation with the KFN or consideration of the option of leasing in 1956 was required.\n[101] I accordingly find that the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of these issues was unreasonable. It follows that the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on the impugned issues cannot stand.\nIV. Proposed Disposition [102] I would therefore set aside the Decision in part and remit to the Tribunal the issue of the Crown\u2019s breach of its pre and post-surrender fiduciary duties for redetermination, the whole in accordance with these Reasons. As I would find the KFN entirely successful, I would award it costs.\n\u201cMary J.L. Gleason\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nJudith Woods J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nJ.B.

The two are identical, there being no confidential information disclosed in the confidential reasons.\nLOCKE J.A.\nI. Background [1] This is an appeal of a decision of the Federal Court (2022 FC 107, per Justice Michael D. Manson) in the context of an action brought pursuant to subsection 6(1) of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations, S.O.R.\/93-133. In that action, the respondents, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. (collectively, Janssen), sought a declaration that the appellant, Apotex Inc. (Apotex), would infringe Canadian Patent No. 2,655,335 (the 335 Patent) if it were to make, use or sell its generic version of Janssen\u2019s patented medicine called INVEGA SUSTENNA.\n[2] INVEGA SUSTENNA involves a suspension of paliperidone palmitate for the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders. The 335 Patent teaches a regimen to achieve an optimum plasma concentration-time profile. It teaches a first loading dose administered in the deltoid muscle on day 1, a second loading dose administered in the deltoid muscle on day 8, and then monthly maintenance doses thereafter administered either in the deltoid or gluteal muscle. For non-renally impaired patients, the first and second loading doses are 150 and 100 mg equivalent (mg-eq.), respectively, and the monthly maintenance doses are 75 mg-eq. each. For renally impaired patients, the first and second loading doses are 100 and 75 mg-eq., respectively, and the monthly maintenance doses are 50 mg-eq. each.\n[3] Apotex brought a motion for summary trial seeking dismissal of Janssen\u2019s action on the basis that its product would not infringe the 335 Patent since it would not provide the 75 mg-eq. dose, which is an essential element of all of the claims thereof. The Federal Court found that it was an appropriate proceeding for summary trial, but decided the action in favour of Janssen, finding that Apotex would induce infringement of the 335 Patent with its generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA.\n[4] The legal test for a finding of inducing patent infringement was correctly stated by the Federal Court at paragraph 113 of its reasons:\nThere is a three \u201cprong\u201d test for inducement: (1) direct infringement by a third party; (2) the inducer influenced the third party to the point that the infringing act would not have occurred without the influence; and (3) the defendant knew that its influence would bring about the infringing act [Corlac Inc. v. Weatherford Canada Ltd., 2011 FCA 228 [Corlac]].\n[5] The Federal Court found that each of the prongs of the test was satisfied. In the present appeal, Apotex takes issue only with the second prong. Specifically, Apotex argues that the Federal Court erred in finding that it would induce infringement of the 335 Patent such that, without its influence, the act of direct infringement would not occur.\n[6] For the reasons set out below, I would dismiss this appeal.\nII. The Federal Court\u2019s Decision [7] The Federal Court addressed the second prong of the test for inducing infringement at paragraphs 125 to 148 of its reasons.\n[8] After correctly defining the legal test, the Federal Court noted Apotex\u2019s argument that the facts were similar to those in Janssen Inc. v. Teva Canada Limited, 2020 FC 593, 321 A.C.W.S. (3d) 539 (Teva Paliperidone), and that the Court should therefore follow its conclusion therein that \u201cany act of direct infringement would be a result of physician skill and judgment applied to specific patient characteristics, rather than any influence exercised by the product monograph for the [Apotex] Product\u201d (paragraph 129 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons). Unfortunately for Apotex, the argument that the result in this case on inducing infringement should follow that in Teva Paliperidone no longer assists it because the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion on that issue was reversed on appeal to this Court: Teva Canada Limited v. Janssen Inc., 2023 FCA 68, [2023] F.C.J. No. 467.\n[9] The Federal Court went on to address a further argument by Apotex. This is based on the assertions that:\n\u201c[T]he ultimate dosing decision is based on physician skill and judgment, not the language in the product monograph\u201d; and\nBecause physicians are already familiar with the INVEGA SUSTENNA product, they will not be influenced in their prescribing practices to the extent necessary to meet the second prong of the test in Corlac (see paragraph 132 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons).\n[10] The Federal Court found that each of the expert witnesses agreed that \u201cpatients may receive the claimed dosage regimen as a result of referring to the Apotex product monograph\u201d (see paragraph 138 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons). The Federal Court also found that \u201cApotex\u2019s product monograph includes recommendations to prescribers for use of the claimed dosage regimen\u201d (see paragraph 143 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons).\n[11] The Federal Court concluded its discussion of the second prong of the test for inducing infringement as follows:\n[147] Notwithstanding the exercise of skill and judgment by prescribing physicians in selecting the dosing regimen for patients, the evidence before the Court in this case establishes that acts of infringement will be influenced by the acts of the alleged inducer, Apotex, to the point that, without the influence, direct infringement will not take place. Apotex\u2019s product monograph will influence prescribers and patients to implement the claimed dosage regimen, thereby directly infringing the 335 Patent.\n[148] I am satisfied, on the evidence before the Court that Janssen has proven, on a balance of probabilities, that at least some prescribers of the impugned [Apotex] Product will be sufficiently influenced by the Apotex product monograph to induce infringement by those prescribing physicians.\nIII. Standard of Review [12] The parties agree that the standard of review applicable in this case is as set out in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. Questions of law are reviewed on a standard of correctness, and questions of fact or of mixed fact and law from which no question of law is extricable are reviewed on a standard of palpable and overriding error. A palpable error is one that is obvious. An overriding error is one that goes to the very core of the outcome of the case. When arguing palpable and overriding error, it is not enough to pull at leaves and branches and leave the tree standing. The entire tree must fall: Canada v. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 FCA 165, [2012] F.C.J. No. 669 at para. 46 (cited with approval in Benhaim v. St-Germain, 2016 SCC 48, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 352 at para. 38).\nIV. Analysis [13] Apotex focuses its argument on the high threshold for influence required by the second prong of the test for inducement: that the infringing act would not have occurred without the influence. This Court has equated this threshold to a sine qua non (without which not) test: MacLennan v. Produits Gilbert Inc., 2008 FCA 35, [2008] F.C.J. No. 128 at para. 38 (MacLennan). Apotex urges this Court to treat the threshold as a \u201cbut for\u201d test, and it cites jurisprudence that calls this a causation test. I have no objection to Apotex\u2019s characterization of the test, but I do not find it to be more helpful that the \u201cwould not have occurred without\u201d and \u201csine qua non\u201d characterizations provided in the jurisprudence of this Court. In my view, these are merely different ways of describing the same threshold.\n[14] Apotex relies on the fact that its product monograph would essentially be a copy of that for INVEGA SUSTENNA, and the assertion that prescribing practices of physicians would not change if Apotex were allowed to market its generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA. In light of the foregoing, Apotex argues that any influence that its product monograph could have on any ultimate act of direct infringement could not rise to the level required in Corlac.\n[15] Apotex supplements its argument by asserting that the Federal Court lacked any meaningful analysis in its consideration of the second prong. It adds that the Federal Court\u2019s statement at paragraph 138 of its reasons that \u201cpatients may receive the claimed dosage regimen as a result of referring to the Apotex product monograph\u201d (see paragraph 10 above) can be of limited assistance because paragraph 138 contains inaccuracies and appears to have been copied from another decision.\n[16] I will address this supplementary argument first. It is helpful to begin by quoting the entirety of paragraph 138 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons:\nAs outlined previously, each expert agrees that patients may receive the claimed dosage regimen as a result of referring to the Apotex product monograph. All four experts acknowledged on cross-examination that while the product monograph for the [Apotex] Product does not explicitly recommend a 75 mg-eq. monthly maintenance dose, it is a therapeutic option within a recommended range in the Apotex product monograph. Moreover, a 75 mg-eq. loading dose on Day 8 is explicitly recommended for renally impaired patients.\n[17] Apotex argues that it was simply wrong to state that the content of the first sentence in that paragraph was \u201coutlined previously\u201d. It adds that paragraph 138 is essentially the same as paragraph 131 from Janssen Inc. v. Pharmascience Inc., 2022 FC 62, 190 C.P.R. (4th) 1 (Pharmascience), which the same judge (Justice Manson) decided just days prior in another case involving the same Janssen plaintiffs, the same 335 Patent, and the same drug (INVEGA SUSTENNA). Apotex argues that there is a similar problem in relation to the remainder of paragraph 138 \u2013 it is essentially the same as paragraph 127 of Pharmascience. Apotex asserts that the summary trial that led to the present appeal heard from five experts not four, and that those experts agreed that Apotex\u2019s product monograph does explicitly recommend a 75 mg-eq. maintenance dose.\n[18] I agree with Apotex that it appears that parts of paragraph 138 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons in the decision under appeal were lifted from Pharmascience. It also appears that this paragraph contains some factual inaccuracies. That said, I am not convinced that these inaccuracies rise to the level of overriding errors of such a nature that this Court should intervene.\n[19] Firstly, it was entirely reasonable for the Federal Court to state that the content of the first sentence of paragraph 138 was \u201coutlined previously\u201d. The Federal Court elaborated on this point in paragraphs 139 and 140 of its reasons. In my view, the following paragraphs from the Federal Court\u2019s reasons addressed the experts\u2019 testimony as it related to the issue that \u201cpatients may receive the claimed dosage regimen as a result of referring to the Apotex product monograph\u201d: for Dr. Oluboka, paragraph 63, for Dr. Zhang, paragraph 71, for Dr. Agid, paragraphs 84 and 85, for Dr. Chue, paragraphs 94 and 95, and for Mr. Jones, paragraph 102.\n[20] Further, reading the Federal Court\u2019s reasons as a whole, I do not agree that it was actually confused as to the number of experts or that it misunderstood the nature of their testimonies. The Federal Court provided a summary of each expert\u2019s testimony at paragraphs 58 to 74 and 80 to 104 of its reasons. The reference in paragraph 138 to \u201c[a]ll four experts\u201d appears to be no more than a slip of the pen.\n[21] I also disagree with Apotex\u2019s argument that the Federal Court lacked any meaningful analysis in its consideration of the second prong. Paragraph 124 of its reasons, reproduced here, provides some analysis:\nThere appears to be several instances in the [Apotex] Product product monograph that will influence a physician to prescribe a 75 mg-eq. maintenance dose as part of the claimed dosing regimen leading to direct infringement of the 335 Patent: (i) in the recommended maintenance dose ranges in which 75 mg-eq. is one of the doses; and (ii) in tables outlining instructions for switching patients from oral paliperidone to an injectable product, like the [Apotex] Product or INVEGA SUSTENNA\u00ae. In addition, there is no dispute that 75 mg-eq. is the second loading dose for renally-impaired patients.\n[22] Moreover, the Federal Court\u2019s discussion of Janssen\u2019s arguments at paragraphs 137 and following of its reasons provide an indication of the arguments and evidence upon which it relied. I mention a couple of these at paragraph 10 above. For these reasons, I disagree that the Federal Court\u2019s analysis in its consideration of the second prong was insufficiently based on the facts and law.\n[23] I turn now to Apotex\u2019s more substantive argument that the Federal Court erred in concluding that the high threshold for the second prong of the test for inducing infringement was met in this case. The main weakness of this argument is that it depends on there being a requirement that prescribing practices of physicians be altered because of Apotex\u2019s activities. In fact, this is not necessary. What is required is that the ultimate act of direct infringement occur because of Apotex\u2019s activities.\n[24] It is important to bear in mind that the ultimate act of direct infringement in the present case could be either by a prescriber (e.g. a physician or a nurse practitioner) or by a patient: Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research, 2020 FCA 30, [2020] F.C.J. No. 179 at para. 40, citing AB Hassle v. Genpharm Inc., 2003 FC 1443, 243 F.T.R 6 at para. 127, aff\u2019d 2004 FCA 413, [2004] F.C.J. No. 2079. The Federal Court recognized this at paragraphs 74 and 104 of its reasons. It is also important to understand that inducing patent infringement can occur even where there is no direct contact between the inducer and the direct infringer: MacLennan at para. 43, citing Procter & Gamble Co. v. Bristol-Myers Canada Ltd., [1978] F.C.J. No. 812, 39 C.P.R. (2d) 145 at 167. Accordingly, Apotex could be found to induce infringement by a patient even if they have no direct communication.\n[25] It follows that, even if the practices of prescribing physicians were to remain unchanged following the introduction to the market of Apotex\u2019s generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA, the fact would remain that activities by patients (and by prescribers) that had previously been non-infringing (because the drug was sourced from Janssen) would be infringing once the drug was sourced from Apotex, an unlicensed supplier. As indicated at paragraph 11 above, the Federal Court concluded at paragraphs 147 and 148 of its reasons that such infringement would be influenced by Apotex to the point that, without the influence, direct infringement would not take place. It is in this sense that the Federal Court was entitled to conclude that the second prong of the test for inducing patent infringement was met.\n[26] Apotex argues that the mere fact that its product monograph would be available for consultation is not enough to meet the test for influence. Apotex also argues that the evidence before the Federal Court did not go beyond merely establishing that Apotex\u2019s product monograph would have some influence on the use of its generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA, and therefore did not meet the high threshold for the second prong (the infringing act would not have occurred without the influence). Apotex notes that none of the experts went so far in their testimony as to state explicitly that any direct infringement using Apotex\u2019s product would not occur without Apotex\u2019s influence.\n[27] In my view, this is a factually suffused issue on which Apotex would have to establish that the Federal Court made a palpable and overriding error. The Federal Court did not err in law. Moreover, I am not convinced that, based on the evidence, the Federal Court could not have concluded that the threshold was met. It was entitled to draw inferences from the evidence before it, and there was evidence to support the conclusion that Apotex\u2019s product monograph would give rise to the required influence.\nV. Conclusion [28] It follows from the foregoing that I would dismiss the present appeal. I would award costs to Janssen in the agreed amount of $10,000, all-inclusive.\n\"George R.

Ce jugement (le Jugement), r\u00e9pertori\u00e9 \u00e0 2021 CF 164, accueillait la demande de r\u00e9vision log\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant\/intim\u00e9 incident (l\u2019Appelant) aux termes du paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, L.R.C. 1985, c. A -1 (la Loi) \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du refus de l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l\u2019Agence) de lui communiquer l\u2019enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 des renseignements faisant l\u2019objet de la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information qu\u2019il avait formul\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s d\u2019elle.\n[2] Ce refus \u00e9tait essentiellement fond\u00e9 sur le paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi, lequel oblige le responsable de l\u2019institution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale vis\u00e9 par une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information de \u00ab refuser la communication de documents contenant des renseignements personnels \u00bb. Les renseignements ainsi pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s en vertu du paragraphe 19(1) en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont les images de voyageurs et d\u2019agents de l\u2019Agence capt\u00e9es par des cam\u00e9ras de surveillance install\u00e9es par l\u2019Agence \u00e0 un des points d\u2019entr\u00e9e de la fronti\u00e8re canado-am\u00e9ricaine o\u00f9 travaillait l\u2019Appelant. Seules les images des agents sont en cause ici.\n[3] L\u2019Appelant, qui se repr\u00e9sente seul devant cette Cour, se pourvoit \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du Jugement, m\u00eame si celui-ci lui parait favorable. Il soutient, en effet, que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne s\u2019est pas prononc\u00e9e sur tous les moyens qu\u2019il a soulev\u00e9s devant elle et qu\u2019elle a fait d\u00e9faut, par cons\u00e9quent, d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019Agence de divulguer l\u2019ensemble des renseignements vis\u00e9s par sa demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, et non juste une partie de ceux-ci, comme elle a fait. Pour sa part, l\u2019intim\u00e9\/appelant incident (l\u2019Intim\u00e9) reproche \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019avoir incorrectement limit\u00e9 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019exemption pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 19 de la Loi. Il lui reproche \u00e9galement la d\u00e9marche qu\u2019elle a suivie pour r\u00e9soudre cette question.\n[4] Pour les motifs qui suivent, j\u2019estime que l\u2019appel principal doit \u00e9chouer. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019appel incident, je propose qu\u2019il soit accueilli.\nI. Le contexte [5] Le 3 juillet 2017, l\u2019Appelant est impliqu\u00e9 dans un incident avec l\u2019un de ses sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la fin de son quart de travail. Il \u0153uvre \u00e0 ce moment au poste-fronti\u00e8re du pont Queenston, dans le sud de l\u2019Ontario. Suite \u00e0 cet incident, l\u2019Agence lance une enqu\u00eate interne; l\u2019Appelant, lui, d\u00e9pose un grief.\n[6] Le 31 juillet 2017, l\u2019Appelant, en marge de cette enqu\u00eate et de ce grief, produit aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019Agence une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information. Cette demande (no. A-2017-12202) est libell\u00e9e comme suit :\nLieu : Zone des comptoirs de bus de la section voyageurs du pont Queenston au 14154 Niagara Parkway, Niagara-on-the-lake, ON, L0S 1J0. Je demande que me soient remis l\u2019ensemble des documents suivants : L\u2019ensemble des rapports r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par les employ\u00e9s et les gestionnaires pr\u00e9sents aux comptoirs primaires des bus en avec les all\u00e9gations faites par [\u2026] le 2017-07-03 entre 23:00 et 00:00. Je r\u00e9clame que me soient remis TOUS les rapports de tous les agents ayant eu \u00e0 r\u00e9diger quoi que ce soit par rapport \u00e0 cela. Je r\u00e9clame que me soient [sic] communiqu\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble des copies conformes des enregistrements des vid\u00e9os de surveillance dans la zone de comptoirs de bus entre 23:30 et 0:06 au cours de cette journ\u00e9e. Notamment celles me montrant interagir avec la surintendante [\u2026], le surintendant [\u2026] et l\u2019ensemble des interactions nous impliquant les uns les autres entre 23 :45 et 00 :06. Je r\u00e9clame \u00e9galement que me soient communiqu\u00e9s des enregistrements de toutes les vid\u00e9os de surveillance situ\u00e9es au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e, entre 23 :30 et 00 :06. Je tiens \u00e0 voir les vas et viens des employ\u00e9s quittant et arrivant sur les lieux de travail au cours de cette p\u00e9riode.\n[7] L\u2019Agence r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la demande le 21 f\u00e9vrier 2018 en communiquant \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant les rapports \u00e9crits vis\u00e9s par ladite demande de m\u00eame qu\u2019un total de sept (7) bandes vid\u00e9os, certaines caviard\u00e9es, d\u2019autres non. Insatisfait de la r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019Appelant porte plainte aupr\u00e8s du Commissaire \u00e0 l\u2019information du Canada. Il se plaint principalement du fait que la totalit\u00e9 des bandes vid\u00e9os demand\u00e9es ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e et que celles qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 volontairement alt\u00e9r\u00e9es au montage en plus d\u2019\u00eatre presque impossibles \u00e0 visionner, \u00e9tant en mode acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[8] Le 14 d\u00e9cembre 2018, le Commissaire rejette la plainte, mais indique avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Agence de refaire les bandes vid\u00e9os transmises le 21 f\u00e9vrier 2018 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 corriger le probl\u00e8me technique not\u00e9 par l\u2019Appelant. L\u2019Agence s\u2019ex\u00e9cute le 19 octobre 2018 lorsqu\u2019elle transmet \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant une version corrig\u00e9e des bandes vid\u00e9os en question. Le Commissaire note par ailleurs que si toutes les bandes vid\u00e9os qui ont pu exister au jour et aux heures vis\u00e9s par la demande n\u2019ont pas toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant, c\u2019est parce que certaines ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9es en vertu de la politique de conservation des enregistrements de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l\u2019Agence, laquelle pr\u00e9voit une p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9tention de 30 jours. Seules les bandes vid\u00e9os jug\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires aux fins de l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne entreprise suite \u00e0 l\u2019incident du 3 juillet 2017 sont conserv\u00e9es. Ce sont les sept (7) bandes vid\u00e9os transmises \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant. Le Commissaire note aussi, \u00e0 ce dernier \u00e9gard, que les pr\u00e9l\u00e8vements effectu\u00e9s par l\u2019Agence sur certaines de ces bandes vid\u00e9os sont conformes au \u00ab cadre clair \u00bb r\u00e9gissant le droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e dans le contexte de l\u2019utilisation de cam\u00e9ras de surveillance en milieu de travail.\n[9] Suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception du rapport du Commissaire \u00e0 l\u2019information, l\u2019Appelant exerce le recours en r\u00e9vision pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi. Aux termes de ce recours, l\u2019Appelant, qui est alors repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par avocat, demande \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale :\na) de d\u00e9clarer que l\u2019Agence ne peut pas s\u2019appuyer sur le paragraphe 19(1) de la [Loi] pour refuser de communiquer certains enregistrements des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019Agence, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ces enregistrements contiennent des renseignements vis\u00e9s par le paragraphe 3(j) de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, RSC 1985, c P-21; et ainsi\nb) d\u2019infirmer les d\u00e9cisions dat\u00e9es du 21 f\u00e9vrier 2018 et du 19 octobre 2018; et\nc) d\u2019ordonner au ministre de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et de la Protection civile [\u2026] de r\u00e9pondre int\u00e9gralement \u00e0 la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information no A-2017-12202;\nd) le tout avec d\u00e9pens.\n(Avis de demande, Dossier d\u2019appel amend\u00e9 \u00e0 la p. 817)\nII.

Lire cette exception comme le fait l\u2019Agence serait, poursuit-elle, limiter ind\u00fbment la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de sa disposition liminaire.\n[13] Ayant conclu que les images pr\u00e9lev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale se dit d\u2019avis qu\u2019il ne lui est pas n\u00e9cessaire, dans ce contexte, de trancher le d\u00e9bat entourant l\u2019application faite par l\u2019Agence de l\u2019article 25 de la Loi. Cette disposition l\u00e9gislative impose aux institutions f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, lorsqu\u2019elles sont d\u2019avis, vu la nature des renseignements contenus dans un document vis\u00e9 par une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, que la communication de celui-ci peut \u00eatre refus\u00e9e, l\u2019obligation de n\u00e9anmoins communiquer les parties du document d\u00e9pourvues des renseignements en cause lorsque cela \u00ab ne pose pas de probl\u00e8mes s\u00e9rieux \u00bb.\nIII. Questions en litige et norme de contr\u00f4le [14] \u00c0 mon sens, la pr\u00e9sente affaire soul\u00e8ve les questions suivantes :\na) La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a-t-elle omis de se prononcer sur l\u2019ensemble des questions soulev\u00e9es dans le recours que l\u2019Appelant a entrepris devant elle et d\u2019ainsi accorder \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant la r\u00e9paration qu\u2019il recherchait, soit une ordonnance obligeant l\u2019Agence \u00e0 lui divulguer tous les renseignements vis\u00e9s par sa demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information ?\nb) Dans la n\u00e9gative, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a-t-elle commis une erreur justifiant l\u2019intervention de cette Cour en concluant que le recours \u00e0 l\u2019exemption \u00e9tablie au paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ?\nc) Si c\u2019est le cas, y a-t-il lieu de se prononcer sur l\u2019application qu\u2019a faite l\u2019Agence de l\u2019article 25 de la Loi et, s\u2019il y a lieu de le faire, l\u2019application qu\u2019elle en a faite \u00e9tait-elle conforme aux exigences de cette disposition ?\n[15] S\u2019il y a eu, \u00e0 un certain moment, un d\u00e9bat au sein de cette Cour sur la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable \u00e0 l\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aux termes de l\u2019article 41 de la Loi, ce d\u00e9bat a pris fin en juin 2019, par l\u2019ajout, \u00e0 la Loi, de l\u2019article 44.1, lequel \u00e9nonce que les recours entrepris en vertu de l\u2019article 41, notamment, doivent \u00eatre \u00ab entendus et jug\u00e9s comme une nouvelle affaire \u00bb.\n[16] L\u2019ajout de cette disposition fait donc maintenant en sorte que la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable aux appels des d\u00e9cisions rendues aux termes de l\u2019article 41 de la Loi est celle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235 (Housen), et non celle, pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Agraira c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et protection civile), 2013 CSC 36, [2013] 2 R.C.S. 559, applicable aux appels des d\u00e9cisions rendues par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le judiciaire (Canada (Sant\u00e9) c. Elanco Canada Limited, 2021 CAF 191, 337 A.C.W.S. (3d) 153 au para. 32 (Elanco)).\n[17] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que la norme de contr\u00f4le \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Housen requiert que la Cour r\u00e9vise les questions de droit se posant devant elle suivant la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte et qu\u2019elle n\u2019intervienne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions de fait ou mixtes de fait et de droit que si elle constate la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une erreur manifeste et dominante (Housen aux para. 26\u201128; Elanco au para. 33).\nIV. Analyse A. L\u2019appel principal [18] L\u2019Appelant, je le rappelle, soutient que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aurait omis de traiter de l\u2019ensemble des questions soulev\u00e9es dans le recours qu\u2019il a entrepris devant elle, un recours qu\u2019elle devait pourtant juger, pr\u00e9cise-t-il, comme une affaire nouvelle, ce qui, selon lui, l\u2019obligeait \u00e0 se prononcer sur l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de sa demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et \u00e0 ordonner, en cas de succ\u00e8s, la divulgation compl\u00e8te des renseignements qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019Agence.\n[19] Outre le fait que d\u2019aucuns pourraient pr\u00e9tendre que ce type de r\u00e9crimination constitue davantage un motif ouvrant droit \u00e0 une demande de reconsid\u00e9ration aux termes de la r\u00e8gle 397(1)(b) des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, DORS\/98-106, que d\u2019un motif d\u2019appel, cet argument, quoi qu\u2019il en soit, ne r\u00e9siste pas \u00e0 l\u2019analyse, et ce, pour deux raisons. Premi\u00e8rement, une lecture de l\u2019Avis de demande et du m\u00e9moire des faits et du droit produits par l\u2019Appelant devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u00e9montre clairement que l\u2019Appelant a ultimement cibl\u00e9 son recours sur l\u2019utilisation faite de l\u2019article 19 de la Loi en lien avec quatre (4) des sept (7) bandes vid\u00e9os qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, soit celles identifi\u00e9es au paragraphe 28 dudit m\u00e9moire et au paragraphe 16 du Jugement :\na) Traffic_Bus_Passenger_Pil_2017-07-14-1714;\nb) Traffic_Bus_Passenger_Secondary_1_2017-07-14_1700;\nc) Traffic_Bus_Passenger_Secondary_2_2017-07-14_1707;\nd) Traffic_Corr_Outside_1131_2017-07-18_1426.\n[20] C\u2019est donc de cette fa\u00e7on que l\u2019Appelant a formul\u00e9 et circonscrit son recours devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et on ne peut reprocher \u00e0 celle-ci une quelconque omission en rapport avec ce qu\u2019elle avait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider. L\u2019Appelant met l\u2019emphase sur la conclusion de son Avis de demande aux termes de laquelle il requiert qu\u2019il soit ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Intim\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00ab int\u00e9gralement \u00bb \u00e0 sa demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information (Avis de demande, Dossier d\u2019appel amend\u00e9 \u00e0 la p. 46). Or, cette conclusion g\u00e9n\u00e9rique ne peut \u00eatre dissoci\u00e9e du reste de l\u2019Avis de demande et de la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019Appelant a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 sa position dans son m\u00e9moire. En d\u2019autres termes, elle ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un fourre-tout autorisant la prise en compte, devant cette Cour, de moyens n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Je note, du reste, qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune preuve au dossier d\u00e9montrant que l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment par l\u2019avocate qui repr\u00e9sentait l\u2019Appelant lors de l\u2019audience devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[21] Comme l\u2019Intim\u00e9 le souligne \u00e0 juste titre, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, cette Cour ne se penchera pas sur une question qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e en premi\u00e8re instance (Oleynik c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2020 CAF 5, 441 D.L.R. (4th) 744 au para. 72). Or, rien ne justifie, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, une quelconque d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle.\n[22] Cela m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 mon deuxi\u00e8me point. Devant cette Cour, l\u2019Appelant, qui, je le rappelle, se repr\u00e9sente dor\u00e9navant seul, a tent\u00e9 \u00e0 plus d\u2019une reprise d\u2019\u00e9largir le d\u00e9bat en demandant, en outre, la permission de pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en appel de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 cette Cour de r\u00e9pondre \u00ab \u00e0 toutes les questions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es et auxquelles la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas pu r\u00e9pondre du fait des subterfuges [de l\u2019Intim\u00e9] \u00bb. Pour faire sanctionner ces \u00ab subterfuges \u00bb, l\u2019Appelant a m\u00eame pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en outrage au tribunal contre l\u2019affiant principal de l\u2019Intim\u00e9.\n[23] Toutes ces demandes ont \u00e9chou\u00e9. Cette Cour doit donc d\u00e9cider du pr\u00e9sent appel \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du dossier tel que constitu\u00e9 devant elle. Or, ce dossier n\u2019autorise pas l\u2019Appelant \u00e0 \u00e9largir la port\u00e9e du d\u00e9bat comme il souhaiterait le faire ou encore \u00e0 traiter de questions qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[24] L\u2019appel principal m\u2019apparait donc d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de tout fondement. Par cons\u00e9quent, je le rejetterais.\nB. L\u2019appel incident [25] L\u2019appel incident fait intervenir la seconde question en litige, qui est celle de savoir si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a err\u00e9 en concluant que les renseignements dont l\u2019Agence refuse la divulgation ne tombent pas sous l\u2019exemption du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi au motif qu\u2019ils seraient eux-m\u00eames vis\u00e9s par une des exceptions au concept de \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb, tel que d\u00e9fini par la LPRP.\n[26] Cette question met en cause la port\u00e9e du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi et, par ricochet, celle de la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb que l\u2019on retrouve \u00e0 la LPRP et \u00e0 laquelle la Loi renvoie.\n[27] S\u2019agissant d\u2019abord d\u2019une question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation statutaire, le traitement qu\u2019en a fait la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale doit \u00eatre r\u00e9vis\u00e9 selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte (Housen au para. 8) et la question elle-m\u00eame, analys\u00e9e suivant la m\u00e9thode moderne d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois, laquelle requiert que le texte des dispositions en cause soit examin\u00e9 \u00ab dans leur contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s\u2019harmonise avec l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la loi, l\u2019objet de la loi et l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 R.C.S. 27, 154 D.L.R. (4th) 193 au para. 21, citant Elmer A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes, 2e \u00e9d., Toronto, Butterworths, 1983 \u00e0 la p. 87; Bayer Cropscience LP c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CAF 77, 155 C.P.R. (4th) 99 au para. 67, citant Tran c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2017 CSC 50, [2017] 2 R.C.S. 289, au para. 23).\n[28] Du m\u00eame souffle, il nous faudra voir o\u00f9 se situe, par rapport \u00e0 cet exercice, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation retenue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Cette interpr\u00e9tation, qui, je le rappelle, prend essentiellement appui sur la lecture que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a faite des arr\u00eats Dagg et Canada (GRC), peut se r\u00e9sumer comme suit :\na) La Loi, qui vise \u00e0 promouvoir la transparence des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00c9tat, et la LPRP sont des lois compl\u00e9mentaires; elles doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es harmonieusement et aucune n\u2019a pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur l\u2019autre;\nb) Bien que la disposition liminaire de la d\u00e9finition que donne la LPRP du concept de \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb soit tr\u00e8s large, elle est assujettie \u00e0 des exceptions qui, bien qu\u2019elles ne devraient pas limiter la port\u00e9e de ladite d\u00e9finition, s\u2019appliquent, notamment, au contexte du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi;\nc) Il ne fait aucun doute qu\u2019en l\u2019absence de ces exceptions, et en particulier de celle qui concerne l\u2019information portant sur le poste ou les fonctions d\u2019un cadre ou employ\u00e9, actuel ou ancien, d\u2019une institution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, les renseignements en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u2014 les images de coll\u00e8gues de l\u2019appelant apparaissant sur les bandes vid\u00e9os litigieuses \u2014 sont des renseignements personnels prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi;\nd) Or, cette exception, pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP, est applicable aux renseignements en cause puisqu\u2019il est difficile d\u2019imaginer que l\u2019image d\u2019un agent des services frontaliers, capt\u00e9e alors qu\u2019il est en uniforme et en fonction, ne constitue pas, au m\u00eame titre que ses feuilles de pr\u00e9sence au travail, un renseignement portant sur la nature des attributions de son poste; on peut dire, \u00e0 ce titre, qu\u2019il y a presque une ad\u00e9quation entre la pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019agent sur les lieux du travail et l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions;\ne) L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par l\u2019Agence, qui repose sur des analogies faites avec certains des exemples de renseignements personnels que l\u2019on retrouve \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de ce concept \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la LPRP, a pour effet de limiter la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019exception en cause, une approche \u2014 \u00ab circulaire \u00bb \u2014 pourtant rejet\u00e9e dans Canada (GRC).\n[29] Il est utile, \u00e0 ce stade, de reproduire les portions pertinentes du texte des dispositions en cause, l\u2019enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 du texte \u00e9tant reproduite en annexe aux pr\u00e9sents motifs :\nLoi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, L.R.C. 1985, c.

La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en r\u00e9sume correctement les grands traits, particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu\u2019elle souligne la port\u00e9e ind\u00e9niablement large de la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb et le fait que les exceptions \u00e0 cette d\u00e9finition ne devraient pas en limiter la port\u00e9e, du moins, j\u2019ajouterais, au-del\u00e0 de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire.\n[31] Une lecture attentive de cette jurisprudence fait toutefois apparaitre une autre dimension importante du rapport entre la Loi et la LPRP, dimension qui ne transparait pas du Jugement, ce qui explique peut-\u00eatre la port\u00e9e qu\u2019a donn\u00e9e la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP et, de ce fait, \u00e0 l\u2019exemption imp\u00e9rative du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi.\n[32] En effet, bien qu\u2019elles soient compl\u00e9mentaires, comme l\u2019a correctement not\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et qu\u2019elles doivent \u00eatre \u00ab interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es conjointement \u00bb, comme l\u2019a rappel\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019affaire Cie H.J. Heinz du Canada Lt\u00e9e c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2006 CSC 13, [2006] 1 R.C.S. 441 (Heinz), qui mettait aussi en cause la port\u00e9e du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi (Heinz aux para. 2, 12; voir \u00e9galement Dagg au para. 1), il est acquis que la Loi et la LPRP, lues ensemble, \u00ab accordent une plus grande protection aux renseignements personnels \u00bb (Heinz aux para. 29\u201331; voir \u00e9galement : Dagg au para. 48, juge La Forest, dissident quant au r\u00e9sultat). Cela fait en sorte qu\u2019il faut se garder de \u00ab donner une \"interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9troite\" \u00e0 l\u2019exception des renseignements personnels en conf\u00e9rant \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information primaut\u00e9 sur la protection des renseignements personnels \u00bb (Heinz au para. 61, citant Dagg au para. 51, juge La Forest, dissident quant au r\u00e9sultat).\n[33] Il est important de rappeler que le r\u00e9gime mis en place par la Loi et la LPRP vise \u00e0 concilier deux principes oppos\u00e9s que sont l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, d\u2019une part, et la protection des renseignements personnels, d\u2019autre part (Dagg au para. 45, juge La Forest, dissident quant au r\u00e9sultat; voir \u00e9galement Dagg au para. 1 et Canada (GRC) au para. 21, souscrivant dans les deux cas aux motifs du juge La Forest, dissident quant au r\u00e9sultat, sur la fa\u00e7on d\u2019aborder l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Loi et de la LPRP). Ce r\u00e9gime, qui tente d\u2019\u00e9tablir et maintenir un \u00ab fragile \u00e9quilibre \u00bb entre ces deux principes, favorise toutefois, \u00ab syst\u00e9matiquement \u00bb, dans la mesure qui y est pr\u00e9vue, la protection des renseignements personnels (Heinz aux para. 1, 24). Les droits pr\u00e9vus aux deux lois n\u2019ont donc pas, en tout temps, valeur \u00e9gale et lorsqu\u2019il est question des renseignements personnels d\u2019un individu, le droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e l\u2019emporte sur le droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, sauf dans la mesure pr\u00e9vue par la loi (Heinz au para. 26).\n[34] Cette nuance, je le rappelle, ne semble pas faire partie des jalons sur lesquels le raisonnement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est construit. \u00c0 tout le moins, il n\u2019en est pas fait mention. Comme on vient de le constater, ce r\u00e9gime fait clairement primer la protection des renseignements personnels sur le droit \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information. Il requiert, \u00e0 cette fin, de la part des tribunaux, une approche calibr\u00e9e tendant \u00e0 favoriser une \u00ab protection efficace \u00bb de ces renseignements, ce qui doit notamment inciter ceux-ci \u00e0 \u00ab ne pas cr\u00e9er d\u2019obstacles artificiels \u00bb \u00e0 cette protection (Heinz au para. 31).\n[35] Il ne suffit donc pas, pour souligner l\u2019importance de la protection des renseignements personnels dans le cadre de ce r\u00e9gime, de faire \u00e9tat du caract\u00e8re ind\u00e9niablement tr\u00e8s large de la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb; il faut \u00e9galement articuler l\u2019analyse en fonction de la primaut\u00e9 de cette protection sur le droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information. Cela va aussi pour l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 suivant lequel aucune des deux lois en cause n\u2019a pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur l\u2019autre puisqu\u2019en raison de cette primaut\u00e9, le droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information n\u2019a pas, en tout temps, valeur \u00e9gale \u00e0 la protection des renseignements personnels.\n[36] Ayant trac\u00e9 les principes r\u00e9gissant l\u2019interaction entre la Loi et la LPRP, il y a lieu de s\u2019attaquer maintenant au rapport entre le paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi et l\u2019exception \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP.\n[37] S\u2019il est vrai que les fonctionnaires de l\u2019administration f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, en raison de la pr\u00e9sence de cette exception, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019un niveau de protection moindre de leur vie priv\u00e9e, lorsqu\u2019il est question de renseignements portant sur les poste et fonctions qu\u2019ils occupent (Canada (GRC) au para. 34), ils ne sont pas pour autant d\u00e9pourvus de toute protection.\n[38] Pour d\u00e9terminer ce niveau de protection, il faut se demander si les renseignements auxquels l\u2019acc\u00e8s est sollicit\u00e9, \u00ab portent directement sur les caract\u00e9ristiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales rattach\u00e9es au poste ou aux fonctions d\u2019un employ\u00e9 \u00bb et garder en t\u00eate qu\u2019ils \u00ab sont du genre de ceux qu\u2019on trouve dans la description de travail \u00bb, ce qui comprend \u00ab les conditions li\u00e9es au poste, dont les qualit\u00e9s requises, les attributions, les responsabilit\u00e9s, les heures de travail et l\u2019\u00e9chelle de traitement \u00bb (Canada (GRC) au para. 38, citant Dagg au para. 95, juge La Forest, dissident quant au r\u00e9sultat).\n[39] M\u00eame si sa port\u00e9e est \u00ab g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00bb et que la liste d\u2019exemples qu\u2019il comprend n\u2019est pas exhaustive, il reste que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP \u00ab a n\u00e9anmoins une port\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, car les renseignements doivent porter sur le poste ou les fonctions \u00bb et \u00ab ne doit s\u2019appliquer que lorsque les renseignements demand\u00e9s ont un lien suffisant avec les caract\u00e9ristiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales rattach\u00e9es au poste ou aux fonctions [\u2026] \u00bb (Canada (GRC) au para. 38).\n[40] L\u2019exception de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP demeure donc circonscrite par des balises relativement pr\u00e9cises. Par exemple, les renseignements qui touchent \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence et aux caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019un employ\u00e9, tout comme les \u00ab opinions exprim\u00e9es au sujet de la formation, de la personnalit\u00e9 [et] de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience \u00bb de cet employ\u00e9, ne sont pas vis\u00e9s par cette exception (Canada (GRC) au para. 38) . Dans l\u2019affaire Dagg, si les juges majoritaires ont jug\u00e9 que les renseignements contenus \u00e0 une feuille de pr\u00e9sence tombaient sous cette exception, ils n\u2019ont pas manqu\u00e9 de souligner qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait-l\u00e0 de \u00ab renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9riques sur le poste lui-m\u00eame \u00bb (Dagg au para. 12).\n[41] Il en va de m\u00eame de l\u2019\u00e9chelle salariale associ\u00e9e au poste occup\u00e9 par un employ\u00e9, qui tombe sous l\u2019exception de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP, mais non le salaire de l\u2019employ\u00e9, un renseignement qui lui est propre (Dagg au para. 13), bien qu\u2019il soit intimement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019emploi qu\u2019il occupe.\n[42] Ici, la tension est vive entre les \u00ab deux principes oppos\u00e9s \u00bb puisque, comme l\u2019a correctement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait de l\u2019exception de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP, les renseignements en cause se qualifieraient sans \u00e9quivoque au titre de \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb, au sens de la LPRP. On n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 lire la d\u00e9finition de ce concept, reproduite au paragraphe 29 des pr\u00e9sents motifs, pour s\u2019en convaincre.\n[43] L\u00e0 o\u00f9 le b\u00e2t blesse en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, c\u2019est que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a tent\u00e9 de concilier ces deux principes en assimilant \u00ab les renseignements contenus dans une bande vid\u00e9o capt\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e et au d\u00e9part d\u2019un employ\u00e9 \u00bb, qu\u2019elle a par ailleurs reconnus, comme je viens de le mentionner, comme \u00e9tant autrement des renseignements personnels au sens de la LPRP, \u00e0 ceux \u00ab contenus dans [l]es feuilles de pr\u00e9sence \u00bb de l\u2019employ\u00e9. Selon elle, citant l\u2019arr\u00eat Dagg, dans les deux cas, ces renseignements bien qu\u2019ils \u00ab ne r\u00e9v\u00e8lent rien au sujet de la nature des attributions du poste \u00bb en donnent n\u00e9anmoins \u00ab une indication g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de leur \u00e9tendue \u00bb (Jugement au para. 35, citant Dagg au para. 9). L\u2019Appelant fait \u00e9cho au Jugement, sans plus.\n[44] En tout respect, cette ad\u00e9quation est probl\u00e9matique puisqu\u2019elle fait fi de l\u2019ensemble des renseignements propres \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 que peuvent r\u00e9v\u00e9ler les images capt\u00e9es sur les lieux du travail. En d\u2019autres termes, contrairement aux feuilles de pr\u00e9sence, qui n\u2019ont qu\u2019un caract\u00e8re informationnel g\u00e9n\u00e9rique sur le poste occup\u00e9 par l\u2019employ\u00e9 et les fonctions associ\u00e9es \u00e0 ce poste, les images capt\u00e9es sur les lieux du travail en r\u00e9v\u00e8lent, en principe, bien davantage sur l\u2019employ\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame et les \u00ab caract\u00e9ristiques \u00bb qui lui sont propres, et ce, m\u00eame s\u2019il porte un uniforme.\n[45] Il est en effet \u00e0 se demander, comme le requiert la grille d\u2019analyse applicable \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP, dont, du reste, il n\u2019ait pas fait mention dans le Jugement, en quoi les traits physiques ou personnels de l\u2019employ\u00e9 que peuvent r\u00e9v\u00e9ler les images capt\u00e9es par des cam\u00e9ras de surveillance install\u00e9es sur les lieux de travail, comme la couleur de la peau, les traits du visage, la stature, le handicap, l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 un groupe religieux ou autre groupe, le langage corporel et m\u00eame les mani\u00e9rismes observables, portent directement sur les caract\u00e9ristiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales rattach\u00e9es au poste ou fonctions de cet employ\u00e9 et r\u00e9v\u00e8lent des renseignements qui sont du m\u00eame type que ceux que l\u2019on trouve dans une description de travail.\n[46] Je ne vois, bien humblement, aucun rapport entre les deux, et ce, m\u00eame si les images sont capt\u00e9es sur les lieux du travail puisque, au-del\u00e0 de pouvoir visionner l\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00ab en action \u00bb, ces images sont susceptibles de d\u00e9voiler des renseignements qui sont propres \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 et qui sont li\u00e9s davantage \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont il exerce ses fonctions et, ultimement, \u00e0 sa comp\u00e9tence, et \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont il affiche sa personnalit\u00e9, son identit\u00e9 ou ses croyances sur son lieu du travail, ce qui n\u2019est pas couvert par cette exception.\n[47] Sur ce plan, comme nous l\u2019avons vu, la protection de la LPRP continue d\u2019\u00eatre assur\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9raux (Canada (GRC) au para. 38) et le fait de devoir porter un uniforme n\u2019y change rien. Pouss\u00e9e \u00e0 sa limite, cette caract\u00e9ristique \u2014 le fait de porter un uniforme \u2014 cr\u00e9erait deux cat\u00e9gories de fonctionnaires au sein du r\u00e9gime \u00e9tabli par la Loi et la LPRP : ceux qui portent l\u2019uniforme, et qui sont priv\u00e9s de la protection du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi, et ceux qui n\u2019en portent pas et qui, par cons\u00e9quent, continuent de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de cette protection. Cela ne peut avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0 l\u2019intention du Parlement.\n[48] En somme, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, au nom de la transparence des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00c9tat, a fait primer le droit \u00e0 l\u2019information sur celui \u00e0 la protection des renseignements personnels. Elle a, ce faisant, donn\u00e9 une port\u00e9e beaucoup trop large \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP, r\u00e9duisant du m\u00eame coup celle du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi. Ce r\u00e9sultat, \u00e0 mon sens, est, comme on l\u2019a vu, non conforme au droit applicable et d\u00e9coule ainsi d\u2019une erreur justifiant l\u2019intervention de la Cour. En d\u2019autres termes, il lui fallait faire primer le droit \u00e0 la protection des renseignements personnels puisqu\u2019il n\u2019existait pas de lien suffisant entre l\u2019ensemble des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par les images des agents et les caract\u00e9ristiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales rattach\u00e9es \u00e0 leurs postes ou fonctions.\n[49] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, la procureure de l\u2019Intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que l\u2019Agence avait commis une erreur en divulguant l\u2019image des agents qui apparaissent sur les bandes vid\u00e9os sur lesquelles on peut voir aussi l\u2019Appelant. Selon elle, l\u2019image de tous les agents apparaissant sur les bandes vid\u00e9os en cause aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e sans \u00e9gard au fait qu\u2019on y voit l\u2019Appelant ou pas.\n[50] Je suis d\u2019accord puisque rien dans la Loi ou la LPRP ne justifie une telle distinction. En d\u2019autres termes, tous les agents apparaissant sur les bandes vid\u00e9os avaient droit \u00e0 la m\u00eame protection aux termes du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi. En ce sens, il fallait leur appliquer l\u2019exception de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019objet ou \u00e0 la nature de la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information de l\u2019Appelant (Canada (GRC) au para. 32).\n[51] Finalement, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 reproche \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019avoir abord\u00e9 incorrectement l\u2019analyse qu\u2019un recours en vertu de l\u2019article 41 de la Loi lui imposait. L\u2019Intim\u00e9 plaide essentiellement que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale devait proc\u00e9der \u00e0 sa propre analyse, et non, axer celle-ci sur la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019Agence et sur ce qui la motivait.\n[52] Compte tenu de la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j\u2019en suis arriv\u00e9 sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019exception de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP et, par-del\u00e0, de l\u2019exemption pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, selon moi, d\u2019aborder en d\u00e9tail le second volet de l\u2019appel incident. Il suffit de dire que si certains de ses passages, comme la formulation de la question en litige portant sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi (Jugement au para. 17A), peuvent porter \u00e0 confusion \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, le Jugement, lu dans son ensemble, laisse voir que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait sa propre analyse de la question qu\u2019elle avait \u00e0 trancher, et ce, ind\u00e9pendamment de la position de l\u2019Agence, m\u00eame si elle a critiqu\u00e9 celle-ci \u00e0 certains moments.\n[53] Ayant conclu que l\u2019Agence pouvait, \u00e0 bon droit, recourir au paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi pour refuser la divulgation des images des agents apparaissant sur les bandes vid\u00e9os communiqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant, les questions touchant l\u2019article 25 de la Loi doivent \u00eatre abord\u00e9es.\nC. L\u2019article 25 de la Loi [54] L\u2019article 25 de la Loi oblige le responsable d\u2019une institution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 communiquer les parties du document faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information qui sont d\u00e9pourvues des renseignements dont ce responsable est en droit de refuser la divulgation, \u00e0 condition que le pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement de ces parties ne pose pas de probl\u00e8mes s\u00e9rieux (Merck Frosst Canada Lt\u00e9e. c. Canada (Sant\u00e9), [2012] 1 R.C.S. 23, 342 D.L.R. (4th) 257 au para. 229 (Merck)).\n[55] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la preuve au dossier, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019en dit l\u2019Appelant, r\u00e9v\u00e8le que cet exercice \u2014 obligatoire \u2014 a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait (Merck au para. 236). En effet, les documents en cause \u2014 soit les bandes vid\u00e9os litigieuses \u2014 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant apr\u00e8s qu\u2019aient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s les renseignements que l\u2019Agence estimait \u00eatre des renseignements personnels prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi, m\u00eame si, elle a erron\u00e9ment fait exception. Il ne fait donc aucun doute que l\u2019Agence a trait\u00e9 la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information de l\u2019Appelant en ayant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit le devoir que lui imposait l\u2019article 25 de la Loi.\n[56] La question \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre est donc celle de savoir si l\u2019Agence s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9e de ce devoir selon les exigences de l\u2019article 25. Tel que mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de trancher cette question puisqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que les bandes vid\u00e9os en litige devaient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant dans leur enti\u00e8ret\u00e9, \u00e0 la seule exception des images du public voyageur.\n[57] Dans ces circonstances, je dois en premier lieu d\u00e9cider si cette d\u00e9termination doit \u00eatre laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, auquel cas il faudrait que le dossier lui soit retourn\u00e9, ou s\u2019il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que cette Cour d\u00e9cide de la question au lieu et place de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, comme lui permet de le faire le sous alin\u00e9a 52b)(i) de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. 1985, c. F-7, lequel autorise la Cour, lorsqu\u2019elle est saisie de l\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00e0 \u00ab rendre le jugement que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb rendre et prendre toutes mesures d\u2019ex\u00e9cution ou autres que celle-ci aurait d\u00fb prendre \u00bb.\n[58] D\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, il est important de mentionner que jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant ce pouvoir a \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9 avec parcimonie, car il ne revient normalement pas \u00e0 cette Cour d\u2019agir comme tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance. Cette r\u00e9ticence vient \u00ab non seulement de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience et de l\u2019expertise accrues de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re de recherche des faits, mais aussi des complications pratiques et autres li\u00e9es \u00e0 la recherche des faits par une formation de trois juges \u00bb (Sandhu Singh Hamdard Trust c. Navsun Holdings Ltd, 2019 CAF 295, 169 C.P.R. (4th) 325 au para. 59; voir aussi : Canada (Revenu national) c. Hydro Qu\u00e9bec, 2023 CAF 171 aux para. 27\u201329).\n[59] L\u2019Intim\u00e9 nous exhorte cependant \u00e0 exercer ce pouvoir. Il estime qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice de le faire puisque (i) la preuve n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de la conformit\u00e9 des pr\u00e9l\u00e8vements effectu\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce aux exigences de l\u2019article 25 est d\u00e9j\u00e0 au dossier, (ii) celui-ci, dans sa forme judiciaris\u00e9e, perdure depuis 2019 et engendre de l\u2019incertitude au sein de l\u2019appareil f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sur la fa\u00e7on de traiter les demandes d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information portant sur l\u2019image des employ\u00e9s, et (iii) la r\u00e9solution compl\u00e8te du pr\u00e9sent appel r\u00e9pondrait aux objectifs de r\u00e9solution rapide, efficace et \u00e9conomique devant guider l\u2019exercice des recours entrepris devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[60] Il y aura bient\u00f4t sept (7) ans que l\u2019Appelant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et, comme le souligne l\u2019Intim\u00e9, toute la preuve n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 ce qu\u2019aurait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider cette Cour au lieu et place de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est au dossier. Au surplus, cette preuve n\u2019a rien de controvers\u00e9e si bien que cette Cour est dans une aussi bonne position que le serait la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour d\u00e9cider de cette question. \u00c9galement, le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi incident soul\u00e8ve une question importante et il est, \u00e0 mon avis, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice que la Cour utilise le pouvoir qui lui est d\u00e9volu aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(b)i) de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales afin que cette question soit r\u00e9solue sans plus de d\u00e9lai.\n[61] La Cour doit donc d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019Agence a appliqu\u00e9 correctement l\u2019article 25 (Merck au para. 232) et doit le faire, tel que le pr\u00e9voit le nouvel article 44.1 de la Loi, comme si elle \u00e9tait saisie d\u2019une \u00ab nouvelle affaire \u00bb. \u00c0 cette fin, elle ne doit \u00e0 l\u2019Agence aucune d\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\n[62] Il s\u2019agit ici de se demander si, parmi les images vid\u00e9os soustraites \u00e0 la divulgation, se trouvent des renseignements qui auraient n\u00e9anmoins d\u00fb \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s par l\u2019Agence. Suivant l\u2019article 25 de la Loi, une telle communication s\u2019impose si cela ne pose pas \u00ab de probl\u00e8mes s\u00e9rieux \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019institution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale concern\u00e9e. Ce sera le cas (i) si les renseignements en cause, une fois communiqu\u00e9s, ont un sens sur le plan s\u00e9mantique, rendant ainsi la communication \u00ab utile \u00bb, et (ii) si les avantages li\u00e9s \u00e0 leur pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement et \u00e0 leur divulgation \u00ab justifient les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par l\u2019institution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en vue d\u2019expurger le document en cause \u00bb (Merck au para. 237). En d\u2019autres termes, l\u2019analyse des co\u00fbts et avantages justifiera la divulgation de ces renseignements si le travail de pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement n\u00e9cessaire est raisonnablement proportionn\u00e9 \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019acc\u00e8s qui s\u2019ensuivrait (Merck au para. 237, citant Bande indienne de Montana c. Canada (Ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), [1989] 1 C.F. 143, 51 D.L.R. (4th) 306).\n[63] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il faut appliquer ce test \u00e0 des images vid\u00e9os, et non \u00e0 des documents, comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas dans l\u2019affaire Merck, et il faut le faire en gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit \u00ab l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25, qui vise \u00e0 faciliter l\u2019acc\u00e8s au plus de renseignements possible tout en donnant effet aux exceptions pr\u00e9cises et limit\u00e9es pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 la Loi \u00bb (Merck au para. 238, citant Ontario (S\u00fbret\u00e9 et S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique), 2010 CSC 23, [2010] 1 R.C.S. 815 au para. 67).\n[64] Sur trois (3) des quatre (4) bandes vid\u00e9os en cause, les pr\u00e9l\u00e8vements sont significatifs et visent les membres du public voyageur pr\u00e9sents sur les lieux capt\u00e9s par les cam\u00e9ras de surveillance, de m\u00eame que les agents pr\u00e9sents lorsque l\u2019Appelant n\u2019apparait pas sur les images. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019utilit\u00e9 de ce qui pourrait \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9, il est \u00e0 se demander ce qu\u2019il en serait d\u2019un ensemble disparate d\u2019images vid\u00e9os de lieux physiques (parties de murs, plafonds, corridors, bureaux, etc.) ou encore, pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 la limite, d\u2019images purg\u00e9es des traits physiques ou personnels des agents concern\u00e9s, tels la couleur de la peau, les traits du visage, la stature, le handicap, l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 un groupe religieux ou autre groupe, le langage corporel et les mani\u00e9rismes observables.\n[65] Au niveau des co\u00fbts et des avantages \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une telle extraction de renseignements par ailleurs divulgables, la preuve indique que contrairement \u00e0 des documents, ce type d\u2019exercice, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019images vid\u00e9os, pr\u00e9sente des d\u00e9fis particuliers dans la mesure o\u00f9 chaque seconde d\u2019enregistrement vid\u00e9o contient une soixantaine d\u2019images. L\u2019Intim\u00e9 soutient donc qu\u2019isoler, par exemple, le contenu personnel identifiable de chaque image repr\u00e9sente un d\u00e9fi colossal.\n[66] Je fais miens ici les propos de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Attaran c. Canada (D\u00e9fense nationale), 2011 CF 664, 391 F.T.R. 70 (Attaran), selon lesquels \u00ab l\u2019application de l\u2019article 25 de la [Loi] dans le contexte de la suppression de renseignements personnels sur une photographie [\u2026] devrait favoriser la protection du droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e de la personne vis\u00e9e \u00bb (Attaran au para. 29) (soulignement dans l\u2019original). Cet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 a tout autant son importance, selon moi, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019appliquer l\u2019article 25 de la Loi \u00e0 des identificateurs personnels apparaissant sur des images vid\u00e9os.\n[67] Sans dire qu\u2019en toutes circonstances, ce type d\u2019extraction, quand il s\u2019agit d\u2019images vid\u00e9os, est inutile et n\u2019est pas raisonnablement proportionn\u00e9 \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019acc\u00e8s qui s\u2019ensuit, je suis d\u2019avis, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du dossier qui est devant la Cour, que tel est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019article 25 a \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information produite par l\u2019Appelant et l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 en conformit\u00e9 avec son objet. Cet objet, je le rappelle, est de faciliter l\u2019acc\u00e8s dans la meilleure mesure possible tout en donnant effet aux exemptions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 la Loi, dont celle portant sur la protection des renseignements personnels, laquelle est imp\u00e9rative et prime sur le droit \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information.\n[68] Si les pr\u00e9l\u00e8vements effectu\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce peuvent para\u00eetre importants, quantitativement, je rappelle qu\u2019aux termes du paragraphe 19(2) de la Loi, la communication de renseignements personnels s\u2019impose lorsque (i) l\u2019individu qu\u2019ils concernent y consent; (ii) le public y a acc\u00e8s ou (iii) la communication est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019article 8 de la LPRP, lequel \u00e9num\u00e8re un certain nombre de situations o\u00f9 la communication de tels renseignements est permise. Toutefois, l\u2019application du paragraphe 19(2) de la Loi aux circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire d\u00e9borde du cadre de cet appel.\nV. Conclusion [69] Pour toutes ces raisons, je rejetterais l\u2019appel principal, avec d\u00e9pens, et j\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel incident. J\u2019infirmerais ainsi le Jugement et rendant la d\u00e9cision que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb rendre, je rejetterais le recours entrepris par l\u2019Appelant aux termes de l\u2019article 41 de la Loi et je le ferais avec d\u00e9pens en faveur de l\u2019Intim\u00e9 tant devant cette Cour que devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n\u00ab Ren\u00e9 LeBlanc \u00bb\nj.c.a.\n\u00ab Je suis d\u2019accord.\nRichard Boivin j.c.a. \u00bb\n\u00ab Je suis d\u2019accord.\nNathalie Goyette j.c.a. \u00bb\nANNEXE\nLoi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, L.R.C. 1985, c.

La juge de la CCI a conclu que c\u2019est \u00e0 bon droit que le ministre du Revenu national a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les appelants cumulaient des heures d\u2019emploi assurable durant leurs p\u00e9riodes de cong\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 10.1(2) du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-emploi, DORS\/96-332 (R\u00e8glement).\n[2] La seule question qui doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e est celle de savoir si la juge de la CCI a commis une erreur en d\u00e9terminant que les conditions d\u2019application du paragraphe 10.1(2) du R\u00e8glement \u00e9taient remplies.\n[3] La norme de contr\u00f4le qui s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte pour les questions de droit. Pour ce qui est des questions mixtes de fait et de droit, notre Cour interviendra uniquement si l\u2019erreur est manifeste et dominante (Housen c. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235, 2002 CSC 33).\n[4] \u00c0 notre avis, cet appel ne peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[5] Lors de l\u2019audience, les appelants ont fait grand cas du fait que les sommes vers\u00e9es par le fiduciaire constituaient de l\u2019\u00e9pargne et non de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration assurable. Or, l\u00e0 n\u2019est pas la question et cet argument n\u2019est pas pertinent aux fins du pr\u00e9sent litige. En effet, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Lapointe rendue par notre cour (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Lapointe, 2013 CAF 52), l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de cong\u00e9 rev\u00eat le caract\u00e8re de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration assurable au moment o\u00f9 elle est pay\u00e9e, et ce, avant qu\u2019elle ne soit vers\u00e9e en fiducie. En fait, les appelants nous demandent d\u2019ignorer la d\u00e9cision Lapointe en vertu de laquelle nous sommes li\u00e9s. Aucun argument convaincant nous permettant de nous en \u00e9carter nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9.\n[6] Ainsi, en s\u2019appuyant sur la preuve au dossier et la jurisprudence pertinente comme elle l\u2019a fait, la juge de la CCI n\u2019a pas err\u00e9 dans les circonstances de cette affaire, en d\u00e9terminant que pour la p\u00e9riode en cause (18 ao\u00fbt 2016 au 5 ao\u00fbt 2017), les appelants cumulaient des heures d\u2019emploi assurable au cours de leurs p\u00e9riodes de cong\u00e9s pay\u00e9s, car les trois conditions au R\u00e8glement sont remplies: (i) les appelants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9tribu\u00e9s par leur employeur (ii) pour une p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9, et (iii) par un paiement forfaitaire d\u00e9termin\u00e9 sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode.\n[7] Nous ne d\u00e9celons aucune erreur qui justifierait notre intervention.\n[8] L\u2019appel sera donc rejet\u00e9 sans d\u00e9pens.\n\u00ab Richard Boivin \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIERS :\nA-181-22 ET A-182-22\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nYVAN BOUCHARD et YVES PROULX c.

Celui-ci lui reprochait des d\u00e9faillances, durant son quart de travail dans la nuit du 22 au 23 janvier 2017, dans sa surveillance d\u2019une d\u00e9tenue qui pr\u00e9sentait alors un risque \u00e9lev\u00e9 de suicide et qui, de ce fait, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9e sous surveillance accrue dans une cellule de l\u2019unit\u00e9 d\u2019isolement du p\u00e9nitencier o\u00f9 la demanderesse travaillait.\n[3] La Commission s\u2019est dite satisfaite que l\u2019employeur avait rencontr\u00e9 son fardeau de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de deux des quatre actes d\u2019inconduite reproch\u00e9s \u00e0 la demanderesse, soit ceux de ne pas avoir, \u00e0 certaines p\u00e9riodes du quart de travail, effectu\u00e9 ses patrouilles de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et assur\u00e9 une observation constante de la d\u00e9tenue comme l\u2019exigeaient les r\u00e8gles et proc\u00e9dures applicables. Bien qu\u2019elle ait exon\u00e9r\u00e9 la demanderesse des deux autres actes d\u2019inconduite qui \u00e9taient dirig\u00e9s contre elle, soit ceux de ne pas avoir assur\u00e9, plus sp\u00e9cifiquement, une surveillance constante de la d\u00e9tenue vuln\u00e9rable lorsqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait assise sur le mur du fond de l\u2019unit\u00e9 d\u2019isolement et de ne pas avoir d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 une coll\u00e8gue de travail qui, selon l\u2019employeur, avait aussi failli \u00e0 ses obligations de surveillance accrue, la Commission a maintenu la mesure disciplinaire prise par l\u2019employeur, ne la jugeant pas excessive dans les circonstances.\n[4] Devant nous, la demanderesse reproche \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019avoir ignor\u00e9 l\u2019un de ses arguments, soit une d\u00e9fense de mesure disciplinaire discriminatoire, et d\u2019avoir maintenu cette mesure \u2014 une suspension de 15 jours sans salaire \u2014 malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 exon\u00e9r\u00e9e de deux des quatre chefs d\u2019inconduite qui pesaient contre elle.\n[5] Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que la norme de r\u00e9vision applicable \u00e0 l\u2019examen de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable (Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653 (Vavilov); Babb c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2022 CAF 55 au para. 31). Une d\u00e9cision sera raisonnable si elle est fond\u00e9e sur un raisonnement intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rent et est justifi\u00e9e au regard des contraintes juridiques et factuelles pertinentes (Vavilov aux para. 84\u201185). La cour de r\u00e9vision doit s\u2019attarder tant au r\u00e9sultat qu\u2019au raisonnement \u00e0 l\u2019origine de ce r\u00e9sultat (Vavilov au para. 87).\n[6] Je suis d\u2019avis, apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites et orales des parties et plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement l\u2019ensemble du dossier qui est devant nous, que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est raisonnable et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a donc pas lieu d\u2019intervenir.\n[7] Tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la demanderesse reproche \u00e0 la Commission, dans un premier temps, d\u2019avoir omis de consid\u00e9rer un argument qui, selon elle, \u00e9tait essentiel \u00e0 sa cause, soit celui d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment d\u2019un coll\u00e8gue qui \u00e9tait aussi d\u2019office durant son quart de travail et qui, lui, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir pourtant ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 ses rondes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re qu\u2019elle. La demanderesse soutient qu\u2019il est bien \u00e9tabli en droit du travail que le m\u00eame comportement doit \u00eatre sanctionn\u00e9 de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, et ce, dans le but de maintenir une certaine coh\u00e9rence dans l\u2019exercice du pouvoir disciplinaire de l\u2019employeur. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0, selon elle, d\u2019un argument important que la Commission ne pouvait ignorer.\n[8] Nous ne pouvons faire droit \u00e0 ce moyen dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Comme la demanderesse le rappelle elle-m\u00eame, la Commission n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenue de traiter de chaque argument et de chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve que lui a soumis la demanderesse (Vavilov aux para. 91, 128), bien qu\u2019elle ait fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, dans ses motifs, au t\u00e9moignage de cet employ\u00e9 (D\u00e9cision aux paras. 91, 104, 188). Mais plus important encore, il est bien \u00e9tabli que la simple preuve d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement n\u2019est pas suffisante pour faire valoir avec succ\u00e8s une d\u00e9fense de traitement discriminatoire; encore faut-il expliquer les raisons de cette diff\u00e9rence de traitement, lesquelles peuvent \u00eatre multiples (Bridgen c. Canada (Service correctionnel), 2014 CAF 237, 465 N. R. 73 au para. 59 (Bridgen), citant Canada v. Barrett, [1984] F.C.J. No. 249, 53 N. R. 60 au para. 25).\n[9] Or, ce fardeau incombait \u00e0 la demanderesse (Bridgen au para. 60). Toutefois, comme le souligne avec justesse le d\u00e9fendeur dans son m\u00e9moire, ce moyen de d\u00e9fense n\u2019apparaissait pas, devant la Commission, aussi essentiel \u00e0 la demanderesse qu\u2019elle le pr\u00e9tend maintenant. En effet, mis \u00e0 part une br\u00e8ve r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans la d\u00e9claration d\u2019ouverture, ni la preuve n\u00e9cessaire ni les autorit\u00e9s soumises par la demanderesse \u00e0 la Commission ne permettaient d\u2019\u00e9tayer une telle d\u00e9fense. Bien qu\u2019il e\u00fbt probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 souhaitable que la Commission en fasse \u00e9tat, ne serait-ce que bri\u00e8vement, le fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas senti besoin de le faire ne constitue pas, dans ces circonstances, une erreur justifiant l\u2019intervention de la Cour.\n[10] Je rappelle \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard que nous devons interpr\u00e9ter la d\u00e9cision de la Commission et les motifs qui la sous-tendent \u00ab en fonction de l\u2019historique et du contexte de l\u2019instance dans laquelle ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus \u00bb, ce qui comprend notamment, la preuve dont la Commission disposait (Vavilov au para. 94). L\u2019absence d\u2019une preuve cruciale \u2014 ici ce qui a pu motiver le fait qu\u2019aucune sanction n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise contre ce coll\u00e8gue de la demanderesse \u2014 \u00ab peut expliquer un aspect du raisonnement du d\u00e9cideur qui ne ressort pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence des motifs eux\u2011m\u00eames \u00bb (Vavilov au para. 94). On pourrait en dire autant du fait, tel que cela ressort aussi de la preuve au dossier, que ce coll\u00e8gue n\u2019\u00e9tait pas charg\u00e9, durant ce quart de travail, d\u2019effectuer exactement les m\u00eames fonctions que la demanderesse. Or, suivant la jurisprudence de la Commission et, plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les autorit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de droit du travail, une d\u00e9fense de traitement discriminatoire ne peut r\u00e9ussir, comme l\u2019\u00e9nonce la demanderesse elle-m\u00eame, que s\u2019il y a une parfaite ad\u00e9quation entre les deux situations (Donald J.M. Brown Q.C., David M. Beatty et Adam J. Beatty, Canadian Labour Arbitration, 5e ed, Thomson Reuters, 2019 (feuilles mobiles mises \u00e0 jour en 2023) \u00a7 7:70; Bridgen au para. 61-62; Ranu v. Deputy Head (Correctional Service of Canada), 2014 PSLRB 89 au para. 48). La preuve, ici, ne pointait pas dans cette direction.\n[11] En somme, vu l\u2019historique et le contexte de l\u2019instance dans laquelle la d\u00e9cision de la Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, l\u2019intelligibilit\u00e9 et la transparence de ladite d\u00e9cision n\u2019apparaissent pas affect\u00e9es par l\u2019absence de mention de la d\u00e9fense de traitement discriminatoire, du moins pas \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 l\u2019intervention de la Cour s\u2019imposerait.\n[12] Quant au deuxi\u00e8me moyen de contestation de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, li\u00e9 \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation du caract\u00e8re excessif de la sanction disciplinaire impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la demanderesse, je suis \u00e9galement d\u2019avis qu\u2019il ne peut r\u00e9ussir. Selon la demanderesse, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est d\u00e9raisonnable \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard puisque celle-ci a maintenu la mesure disciplinaire tout en, du m\u00eame souffle, l\u2019exon\u00e9rant de deux des quatre chefs d\u2019inconduite qui pesaient contre elle. Dans un tel contexte, dit-elle, une sanction moins lourde s\u2019imposait.\n[13] Dans l\u2019affaire Lloyd c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2016 CAF 115, 265 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1036 (Lloyd), une affaire pr\u00e9sentant des similitudes avec le pr\u00e9sent dossier, la Cour a statu\u00e9 que le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la mesure disciplinaire \u2014 dans ce cas une suspension de 40 jours \u2014 devait \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00ab \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des deux actes d\u2019inconduite qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis \u00bb (Lloyd au para. 23). Dans cette affaire, il y en avait (7) sept (Lloyd au para. 10). Or, c\u2019est exactement ce que la Commission a fait en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tant parfaitement consciente que l\u2019employeur n\u2019avait \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une partie de l\u2019inconduite all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (D\u00e9cision aux para. 191, 205).\n[14] La Commission, appliquant la grille d\u2019analyse ressortant de la jurisprudence de ce tribunal (D\u00e9cision au para. 193, citant Brazeau c. Administrateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics et des Services gouvernementaux), 2008 CRTFP 62), laquelle n\u2019est pas remise en cause ici, a jug\u00e9 que parmi tous les facteurs qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 soupeser, celui de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction au regard des politiques de l\u2019employeur et de ses obligations \u00e9tait le plus important en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (D\u00e9cision au para. 201). Selon la Commission, la gravit\u00e9 des deux actes d\u2019inconduite \u00e9tablis \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la demanderesse \u00e9tait telle qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas convaincue que la sanction impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la demanderesse devait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e puisque ces actes d\u2019inconduite touchaient directement la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rentes personnes (D\u00e9cision aux para. 202\u2013205).\n[15] \u00c0 mon sens, cette conclusion respecte les contraintes factuelles et juridiques qui encadraient l\u2019action de la Commission dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Dans Lloyd, la Cour n\u2019\u00e9nonce pas que dans les cas o\u00f9 une partie seulement des actes reproch\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 sont \u00e9tablis, la sanction disciplinaire doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre r\u00e9vis\u00e9e \u00e0 la baisse, ce qu\u2019a reconnu la demanderesse \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Je ne crois pas non plus qu\u2019un tel \u00e9nonc\u00e9 puisse en \u00eatre inf\u00e9r\u00e9 (voir aussi : Mackey v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 213, au para. 9). Ce jugement de la Cour nous enseigne plut\u00f4t que dans de telles circonstances, l\u2019explication du tribunal pour le maintien de la sanction doit \u00eatre plus robuste qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019\u00e9tait dans cette affaire. En somme, chaque cas est tributaire de ses circonstances propres.\n[16] Ici, ce que la demanderesse nous demande, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, c\u2019est de reconsid\u00e9rer la question, mettre en doute les conclusions tir\u00e9es par la Commission et, ultimement, substituer nos propres conclusions \u00e0 celles de cette derni\u00e8re. Or, comme la Cour a eu l\u2019occasion de le dire \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, cela va bien au-del\u00e0 du r\u00f4le qui est le n\u00f4tre en mati\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le judiciaire (Vavilov aux paras. 102, 125; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c.

Roy Inc. (Gestion Roy) et 4452712 Canada Inc., se pourvoient \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du jugement du juge Smith de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (la CCI), rendu le 28 novembre 2022 (2022 CCI 144). La CCI a confirm\u00e9 les cotisations \u00e9mises par la ministre du Revenu national \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2014, 2015, 2016 et 2017. La CCI a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que des paiements de primes d\u2019assurance effectu\u00e9s par un tiers (R3D) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de contrats d\u2019assurance, dont les appelantes sont titulaires, constituent un avantage au sens des paragraphes 15(1) et 246(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C. 1985, c. 1 (5e suppl.) (Loi).\n[2] Les appelantes \u00e9taient titulaires de six (6) polices d\u2019assurance-vie enti\u00e8re avec comptes de placement d\u2019une valeur totale de 20 000 000 $. Les polices assuraient la vie de leur actionnaire majoritaire, Marc-Andr\u00e9 Roy, et les primes \u00e9taient pay\u00e9es par R3D, la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire r\u00e9vocable. R3D est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en exploitation d\u00e9tenue majoritairement par M. Roy par l\u2019entremise de Gestion Roy. Cette structure a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue afin que R3D ait le capital n\u00e9cessaire pour racheter ses actions de la succession de M. Roy advenant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier.\n[3] Les appelantes soul\u00e8vent de nombreuses questions devant notre Cour, mais elles se r\u00e9sument en fait \u00e0 la question suivante : la CCI a-t-elle err\u00e9 en d\u00e9terminant que les paiements des primes effectu\u00e9s par R3D, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un contrat d\u2019assurance, constituent un avantage au sens de la Loi?\n[4] La norme de contr\u00f4le qui s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est celle de l\u2019erreur manifeste et dominante (Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235). Comme l\u2019a rappel\u00e9 notre Cour \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, notamment dans la d\u00e9cision Canada c. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 CAF 165 au para 46, ce fardeau est lourd : \u00ab Lorsque l\u2019on invoque une erreur manifeste et dominante, on ne peut se contenter de tirer sur les feuilles et les branches et laisser l\u2019arbre debout. On doit faire tomber l\u2019arbre tout entier \u00bb.\n[5] Nous sommes tous d'avis que cet appel ne peut \u00eatre accueilli. Nous souscrivons essentiellement \u00e0 la d\u00e9marche adopt\u00e9e par la CCI et adoptons son analyse des questions en cause et son raisonnement juridique \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard.\n[6] Les appelantes font valoir qu\u2019en tant que titulaires, elles n\u2019ont jamais obtenu d\u2019avantage puisque les polices d\u2019assurance ont \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9es avant que le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de M. Roy survienne et que de toute mani\u00e8re, elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires au contrat. Or, lorsque les appelantes \u00e9taient titulaires, faut-il rappeler que R3D payait les primes d\u2019assurance ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s ann\u00e9e. Ce faisant, les appelantes ont re\u00e7u un avantage puisque pendant des ann\u00e9es elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 titulaires de polices totalisant un capital-d\u00e9c\u00e8s de 20 000 000$ avec tous les droits y aff\u00e9rant sans avoir \u00e0 s\u2019acquitter des primes. La CCI n\u2019a pas err\u00e9 en concluant qu\u2019il existait d\u2019une part, un avantage pour les appelantes, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le maintien de la couverture d\u2019assurance, et, d\u2019autre part, un appauvrissement correspondant pour R3D, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le montant pay\u00e9 au titre des primes d\u2019assurance.\n[7] Les appelantes soumettent \u00e9galement qu\u2019elles ne se sont pas vues attribuer un avantage puisqu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas per\u00e7u la valeur de rachat des comptes de placement, celle-ci ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e \u00e0 R3D. En tant que titulaires des contrats, le choix de verser la valeur de rachat \u00e0 R3D appartenait aux appelantes. Elles auraient tout autant pu conserver ces montants pour elles-m\u00eames. Nous ne d\u00e9celons aucune erreur dans la conclusion de la CCI selon laquelle \u00ab le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu\u2019a re\u00e7u R3D avec l\u2019aval de M. Roy n\u2019est pas pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019avantage re\u00e7u par les appelantes, soit le montant des primes pay\u00e9es par R3D \u00bb car \u00ab le droit de rachat revient \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9 ou au titulaire de la police et non au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire [R3D] \u00bb (Jugement de la CCI aux para. 72 et 102).\n[8] Les appelantes soutiennent de plus que R3D n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de leur conf\u00e9rer un avantage et qu\u2019en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, lorsque la dur\u00e9e du contrat est prise en compte, l\u2019intention \u00e9tait de conf\u00e9rer un avantage \u00e0 R3D. Cependant, comme notre Cour l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lalibert\u00e9 : \u00ab la jurisprudence n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas de mani\u00e8re universelle un lien entre un tel appauvrissement et l\u2019intention d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et encore moins avec l\u2019intention subjective d\u2019un actionnaire majoritaire \u00bb (Lalibert\u00e9 c. La Reine, 2020 CAF 97 au para. 44 (Lalibert\u00e9)). La CCI a correctement conclu que la question de savoir si une op\u00e9ration commerciale conf\u00e8re un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une question de fait et nous ne d\u00e9celons pas d\u2019erreur qui justifierait notre intervention.\n[9] Compte tenu de notre conclusion quant \u00e0 la qualification de l\u2019avantage, nous ne voyons aucune erreur dans la d\u00e9termination de la valeur de l\u2019avantage qu\u2019a faite la CCI pour les ann\u00e9es en cause.\n[10] Finalement, nous partageons la conclusion de la CCI selon laquelle l\u2019analyse \u00e0 \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e au terme du paragraphe 246(1) est substantiellement la m\u00eame que celle prescrite par le paragraphe 15(1) (voir Lalibert\u00e9).\n[11] L\u2019appel sera donc rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\n\u00ab Richard Boivin \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIERS :\nA-273-22 ET A-274-22\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nGESTION M.-A.

Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le CRTC a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Bell et \u00e0 Telus Communications Inc. (TCI) de fournir \u00e0 des revendeurs concurrents acc\u00e8s \u00e0 leurs installations de fibre jusqu\u2019aux locaux des abonn\u00e9s (les installations FTTP) au moyen de \u00ab services d\u2019acc\u00e8s haute vitesse de gros group\u00e9s \u00bb, en Ontario et au Qu\u00e9bec, au plus tard le 7 mai 2024. Le CRTC a ordonn\u00e9 de rendre ces installations accessibles de mani\u00e8re temporaire, en attendant l\u2019issue de l\u2019examen g\u00e9n\u00e9ral que le CRTC est en train d\u2019effectuer \u00e0 la suite de la publication de l\u2019avis de consultation de t\u00e9l\u00e9com du 8 mars 2023.\n[2] Il convient de faire un rappel de l\u2019affaire pour situer la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate et la d\u00e9cision du CRTC dans leur contexte.\n[3] Les installations FTTP donnent acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet haute vitesse. En ordonnant que Bell et TCI fournissent temporairement acc\u00e8s \u00e0 leurs installations FTTP au moyen de services d\u2019acc\u00e8s haute vitesse de gros group\u00e9s, la d\u00e9cision du CRTC exige de Bell et de TCI (dans le cas de cette derni\u00e8re, uniquement pour un nombre relativement petit de clients) qu\u2019elles donnent acc\u00e8s temporairement \u00e0 des revendeurs concurrents, au moyen de services group\u00e9s, \u00e0 leurs installations de fibre en Ontario et au Qu\u00e9bec qui permettent aux clients d\u2019avoir un acc\u00e8s par fil \u00e0 Internet haute vitesse. Le CRTC \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019ainsi les concurrents pourraient vendre des services d\u2019Internet haute vitesse en Ontario et au Qu\u00e9bec qui feraient concurrence \u00e0 ceux offerts par Bell et TCI. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le CRTC a \u00e9galement fix\u00e9 temporairement les tarifs de gros que Bell et TCI pouvaient facturer aux revendeurs pour les services group\u00e9s d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 leurs installations FTTP.\n[4] En 2015, le CRTC a ordonn\u00e9 que les entreprises dot\u00e9es d\u2019installations, dont Bell et TCI, fournissent des services FTTP d\u00e9group\u00e9s aux revendeurs et a fix\u00e9 les tarifs qui pouvaient \u00eatre factur\u00e9s pour ces services.\n[5] La diff\u00e9rence entre les services d\u2019acc\u00e8s group\u00e9s et d\u00e9group\u00e9s est bien r\u00e9sum\u00e9e par Bell, aux paragraphes 18 et 19 des observations \u00e9crites qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate :\n[traduction]\n18. Les entreprises dot\u00e9es d\u2019installations investissent notamment dans deux types d\u2019installations : le transport et l\u2019acc\u00e8s. Les installations de transport permettent que de grandes quantit\u00e9s de trafic de donn\u00e9es soient envoy\u00e9es et re\u00e7ues dans tout le r\u00e9seau de fibres optiques. On peut les comparer aux autoroutes ou aux lignes de transmission d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. Les installations d\u2019acc\u00e8s, par contraste, sont celles qui connectent le lieu o\u00f9 se trouve le client (c.-\u00e0-d. les locaux) au r\u00e9seau de fibres optiques. On peut les comparer aux routes locales ou aux lignes de distribution d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9.\n19. Traditionnellement, le CRTC r\u00e9glemente deux types de services Internet de gros utilisant ces installations :\n(a) les services Internet de gros group\u00e9s : ils permettent aux revendeurs de louer une combinaison (i) d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux installations dont ils ont besoin pour brancher les locaux du client et (ii) d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux installations de transport par lesquelles de grandes quantit\u00e9s de trafic de donn\u00e9es peuvent \u00eatre envoy\u00e9es ou re\u00e7ues. Avant la d\u00e9cision du CRTC, les services de gros group\u00e9s \u00e9taient offerts pour le service Internet de fibre optique jusqu\u2019au n\u0153ud (un bon service Internet, mais pas aussi bon que le service FTTP), mais pas pour le service FTTP, qui est une technologie \u00e9mergente que les entreprises dot\u00e9es d\u2019installations utilisent pour fournir les services Internet les plus rapides dont ils disposent;\n(b) les services Internet de gros d\u00e9group\u00e9s : ils permettent aux revendeurs de louer seulement l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux installations dont ils ont besoin pour connecter les locaux du client, mais pas l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux installations de transport. \u00c0 la place, les concurrents doivent obtenir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des installations de transport soit en investissant dans leurs propres r\u00e9seaux [\u2026] soit en louant des installations d\u2019une autre entreprise sur une base commerciale. Les services de gros d\u00e9group\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts pour les installations FTTP pendant un certain temps, mais, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, aucun des concurrents de Bell ne s\u2019en est pr\u00e9valu.\n[6] Selon certains des intim\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, l\u2019option des services d\u2019acc\u00e8s d\u00e9group\u00e9s aux installations FTTP \u00e9tait inex\u00e9cutable parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait trop ch\u00e8re pour eux selon les modalit\u00e9s fix\u00e9es par le CRTC en 2015.\n[7] Le 9 f\u00e9vrier 2023, le gouverneur en conseil a pris un d\u00e9cret en vertu de l\u2019article 8 de la Loi sur les t\u00e9l\u00e9communications, L.C. 1993, ch. 38, intitul\u00e9 D\u00e9cret donnant au CRTC des instructions sur une approche renouvel\u00e9e de la politique de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication : DORS\/2023-23, enregistr\u00e9 le 10 f\u00e9vrier 2023 (C.P. 2023-110 le 9 f\u00e9vrier 2023) (le d\u00e9cret).\n[8] L\u2019article 10 de ce d\u00e9cret est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi :\nService d\u2019acc\u00e8s haute vitesse de gros group\u00e9\nAggregated wholesale high-speed access service\n10 Le Conseil doit rendre obligatoire la fourniture de services d\u2019acc\u00e8s haute vitesse de gros group\u00e9 \u2014 qui s\u2019ajoutent \u00e0 tout autre type de service d\u2019acc\u00e8s de gros \u00e0 haut d\u00e9bit dont la fourniture est obligatoire \u2014 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il d\u00e9termine qu\u2019une concurrence vaste, durable et significative perdurera m\u00eame si la fourniture d\u2019un service group\u00e9 n\u2019est plus obligatoire.\n10 The Commission must mandate the provision of an aggregated wholesale high-speed access service \u2014 that is additional to any other types of wholesale high-speed access services that are mandated \u2014 until it determines that broad, sustainable and meaningful competition will persist even if the provision of an aggregated service is no longer mandated.\n[9] Le 7 mars 2023, le CRTC a publi\u00e9 l\u2019avis de consultation de t\u00e9l\u00e9com CRTC 2023-56. Dans cet avis, le CRTC a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il allait examiner le cadre existant de services d\u2019acc\u00e8s haute vitesse (AHV) de gros \u00ab compte tenu des conditions changeantes du march\u00e9, des d\u00e9fis consid\u00e9rables dans la mise en \u0153uvre du cadre et de l\u2019importance pour la population canadienne d\u2019avoir plus de choix et des services plus abordables \u00bb. Le CRTC a \u00e9galement exprim\u00e9 les avis pr\u00e9liminaires suivants :\ni) la fourniture de services AHV de gros group\u00e9s devrait \u00eatre obligatoire; ii) l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux installations par fibre jusqu\u2019aux locaux des abonn\u00e9s (FTTP) devrait \u00eatre offert pour ces services; et iii) la fourniture d\u2019installations FTTP au moyen des services AHV de gros group\u00e9s devrait \u00eatre obligatoire temporairement et de mani\u00e8re acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le Conseil parvienne \u00e0 tirer une conclusion \u00e0 savoir si un tel acc\u00e8s doit \u00eatre offert ind\u00e9finiment.\n[10] Dans son avis de consultation, le CRTC a invit\u00e9 les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00e0 formuler des commentaires. Plus de 300 entreprises et individus ont fait conna\u00eetre leur point de vue au CRTC, dont Bell et les intim\u00e9es qui ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des observations dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, soit TekSavvy Solutions inc. (TekSavvy), Qu\u00e9becor M\u00e9dia inc. au nom de Vid\u00e9otron lt\u00e9e (QMI) et Op\u00e9rateurs de r\u00e9seaux concurrentiels canadiens (ORCC).\n[11] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le CRTC a confirm\u00e9, en partie, ses avis pr\u00e9liminaires sur la mesure temporaire qu\u2019elle envisageait d\u2019imposer. En cons\u00e9quence, le CRTC a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Bell et \u00e0 TCI de fournir aux revendeurs concurrents acc\u00e8s \u00e0 leurs installations FTTP pour les services d\u2019AHC de gros group\u00e9s, en Ontario et au Qu\u00e9bec, au plus tard le 7 mai 2024, de mani\u00e8re temporaire en attendant l\u2019issue de l\u2019examen g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du CRTC \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du cadre des services d\u2019AHV.\n[12] Dans son analyse, le CRTC a not\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, le nombre d\u2019abonn\u00e9s aux services FTTP de Bell avait augment\u00e9 consid\u00e9rablement et que l\u2019intensit\u00e9 de la concurrence dans ce secteur avait d\u00e9clin\u00e9. Il a conclu qu\u2019ordonner temporairement l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services d\u2019acc\u00e8s FTTP group\u00e9s aiderait \u00e0 stabiliser la concurrence. Il s\u2019est \u00e9galement dit d\u2019avis que \u00ab le fait que les concurrents n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en mesure de fournir des services au moyen de r\u00e9seaux FTTP a grandement nui \u00e0 leur capacit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer une concurrence efficace \u00bb. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00ab craint que cette incidence n\u00e9gative sur la concurrence fond\u00e9e sur les services de gros va s\u2019aggraver encore avec le temps \u00bb et que, \u00ab [s]ans intervention r\u00e9glementaire, une v\u00e9ritable concurrence dans les services fond\u00e9s sur les services de gros continuera de diminuer \u00bb (d\u00e9cision du CRTC, au para. 57).\n[13] Le CRTC a limit\u00e9 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019acc\u00e8s temporaire obligatoire aux installations FTTP en Ontario et au Qu\u00e9bec, au motif que ces deux r\u00e9gions sont celles \u00ab o\u00f9 la concurrence fond\u00e9e sur les services de gros est le plus manifestement en d\u00e9clin \u00bb (d\u00e9cision du CRTC, aux paras. 59 et 68).\n[14] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le CRTC a pris en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019observation de Bell selon laquelle elle pourrait ne pas \u00eatre en mesure de recouvrer les co\u00fbts de mise en \u0153uvre associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la fourniture d\u2019acc\u00e8s temporaire \u00e0 ses installations FTTP pour les services d\u2019AHV de gros group\u00e9s si cet acc\u00e8s n\u2019\u00e9tait pas rendu obligatoire de fa\u00e7on permanente. Le CRTC a jug\u00e9 que ces difficult\u00e9s, si elles devaient survenir, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00ab pas insurmontables d\u2019un point de vue r\u00e9glementaire \u00bb. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00ab pr\u00eat \u00e0 traiter ces questions plus tard au besoin \u00bb (d\u00e9cision du CRTC, au para. 67).\n[15] Le contexte \u00e9tant \u00e9tabli, je passe \u00e0 l\u2019examen de la requ\u00eate en tant que telle.\n[16] Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9, Bell demande un sursis \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du CRTC jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que soit tranch\u00e9e sa demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel visant cette d\u00e9cision et, si l\u2019autorisation est accord\u00e9e, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019appel soit tranch\u00e9. Si la requ\u00eate de Bell est accueillie, Bell ne serait pas tenue de fournir \u00e0 ses concurrents l\u2019acc\u00e8s temporaire \u00e0 ses installations FTTP pour les services d\u2019AHV de gros group\u00e9s en Ontario et au Qu\u00e9bec jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que notre Cour se prononce sur la requ\u00eate en autorisation d\u2019appel de la d\u00e9cision du CRTC et, si l\u2019autorisation est accord\u00e9e, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019appel soit tranch\u00e9.\n[17] TekSavvy, QMI et ORCC s\u2019opposent \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\n[18] Le crit\u00e8re applicable aux sursis comme celui demand\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est bien connu et n\u00e9cessite que la partie requ\u00e9rante \u00e9tablisse : (1) que l\u2019appel soul\u00e8ve une question s\u00e9rieuse; (2) qu\u2019elle subirait un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable si le sursis \u00e9tait refus\u00e9; et (3) que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients penche en faveur du sursis : RJR-MacDonald Inc c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 1994 CanLII 117 (CSC), [1994] 1 R.C.S. 311, \u00e0 la p. 334 (RJR-MacDonald); Canada c.

Les trois conditions ci-dessus doivent \u00eatre remplies pour que le tribunal accorde le sursis.\n[19] Le seuil applicable \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re condition, soit l\u2019existence d\u2019une question s\u00e9rieuse, est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement peu \u00e9lev\u00e9. Ce seuil est atteint dans les affaires, comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, o\u00f9 les questions soulev\u00e9es dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel ne sont pas frivoles ou vexatoires : RJR-MacDonald, \u00e0 la p. 348; Conseil canadien pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, aux paras. 18 et 22. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je suis pr\u00eate \u00e0 accepter, pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, que l\u2019avis d\u2019appel de Bell soul\u00e8ve au moins une question s\u00e9rieuse.\n[20] Cependant, je conclus que Bell n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019elle subirait un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable si le sursis \u00e9tait refus\u00e9. La deuxi\u00e8me condition n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019octroi du sursis demand\u00e9 n\u2019est donc pas remplie.\n[21] Le pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable renvoie \u00e0 la nature, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue, du pr\u00e9judice que subira la partie si le sursis est rejet\u00e9. Il doit y avoir une \u00ab une forte probabilit\u00e9 que, faute de sursis, un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable soit in\u00e9vitablement caus\u00e9 \u00bb : voir Arctic Cat, Inc. c.

Le pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable est \u00e9galement le pr\u00e9judice qui est in\u00e9vitable : Janssen Inc. c. AbbVie Corporation, 2014 CAF 112, [2014] A.C.F. no 471 (QL), au para. 24 (Janssen). Comme notre Cour l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 au paragraphe 24 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Janssen, \u00ab il serait \u00e9trange qu\u2019une partie faisant valoir un pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019elle a elle\u2011m\u00eame caus\u00e9, un pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019elle aurait pu ou pourrait encore \u00e9viter ou un pr\u00e9judice auquel elle aurait pu ou pourrait encore rem\u00e9dier, puisse justifier un redressement de si grave port\u00e9e [qu\u2019apporterait le sursis] \u00bb.\n[23] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a donn\u00e9 des exemples du type de pr\u00e9judice qui peut s\u2019av\u00e9rer irr\u00e9parable parce qu\u2019il ne peut \u00eatre quantifi\u00e9. On y trouve notamment les situations o\u00f9 la partie demandant le sursis perdra son entreprise, subira une perte commerciale permanente ou verra sa r\u00e9putation commerciale entach\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re irr\u00e9versible : voir RJR-MacDonald\u00b8 \u00e0 la p. 341, renvoyant \u00e0 R.L.

Il en est ainsi puisque, comme l\u2019avait conclu le juge Stratas au paragraphe 48 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Shotclose :\nIl est beaucoup trop facile pour ceux qui demandent un sursis dans une affaire comme celle\u2011ci d\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9rer diverses difficult\u00e9s, de les qualifier de graves, puis, au moment de pr\u00e9ciser le pr\u00e9judice qui risque d\u2019en d\u00e9couler, d\u2019employer des termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et expressifs qui ne servent pour l\u2019essentiel qu\u2019\u00e0 affirmer \u2013 et non \u00e0 prouver \u00e0 la satisfaction de la Cour \u2013 que le pr\u00e9judice est irr\u00e9parable.\n[26] Bell note que notre Cour a reconnu le pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable dans des ordonnances ayant sursis \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de certaines d\u00e9cisions du CRTC en attendant l\u2019appel. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Aboriginal Voices Radio Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CAF 172, 2015 CarswellNat 12195, notre Cour a sursis \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision du CRTC qui ordonnait la fermeture d\u2019une station de radio. Aussi, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat North American Gateway Inc. c. Conseil de la radiodiffusion et des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications canadiennes, [1997] A.C.F. no 628 (QL), 1997 CarswellNat 1268, notre Cour a sursis \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision du CRTC parce que la preuve \u00e9tablissait que cette d\u00e9cision aurait eu pour effet d\u2019obliger les requ\u00e9rantes \u00e0 \u00ab cesser leurs activit\u00e9s en quelques jours \u00bb (au para. 13). Enfin, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat CKLN Radio Incorporated c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CAF 56, 2011 CarswellNat 8229, notre Cour a sursis \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision du CRTC qui aurait eu pour r\u00e9sultat la perte d\u2019une fr\u00e9quence radio en demande dans un march\u00e9 fortement contest\u00e9, ce qui aurait vraisemblablement mis en p\u00e9ril l\u2019existence d\u2019une station de radio universitaire.\n[27] Comme il appara\u00eet clairement ci-apr\u00e8s, les affaires ci-dessus sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[28] Bell renvoie aussi \u00e0 deux ordonnances rendues verbalement qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9es, dont celle rendue par notre Cour en 2019 dans le dossier 19-A-59. Cependant, parce qu\u2019elles sont br\u00e8ves, ces ordonnances ne fournissent ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre d\u2019indication quant aux circonstances pertinentes ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 leur prononc\u00e9, sauf l\u2019affirmation selon laquelle la Cour \u00e9tait convaincue que les ordonnances de sursis \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires pour pr\u00e9venir une distorsion du march\u00e9 : dossier de requ\u00eate de Bell, onglet 4, pi\u00e8ces H et I de l\u2019affidavit de Sonia Atwell. Par contre, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le CRTC a rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans le but de corriger une telle distorsion et de pr\u00e9server la concurrence dans le march\u00e9 de l\u2019Internet haute vitesse en Ontario et au Qu\u00e9bec.\n[29] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Bell ne fait valoir que des affirmations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales quant au pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019elle pourrait subir si le sursis n\u2019\u00e9tait pas accord\u00e9 et ne pr\u00e9sente pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suffisamment probants dont il ressort une forte probabilit\u00e9 que, faute de sursis, un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable sera in\u00e9vitablement caus\u00e9.\n[30] Bell affirme qu\u2019elle subira trois types de pr\u00e9judices qui, selon elle, seront irr\u00e9parables si elle se conforme \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du CRTC : (1) elle perdra des clients et des revenus; (2) elle devra d\u00e9bourser des co\u00fbts pour la mise en \u0153uvre de la d\u00e9cision du CRTC, lesquels seront irr\u00e9couvrables; (3) elle devra reporter ou annuler d\u2019autres projets. Cependant, Bell n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suffisamment d\u00e9taill\u00e9s et probants que ces pr\u00e9judices seraient irr\u00e9parables.\n[31] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de ses all\u00e9gations de pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable, Bell se fonde sur un affidavit de sa vice-pr\u00e9sidente principale des Services technologiques, Anuja Sheth (l\u2019affidavit de Mme Sheth), lequel est conjectural et manque d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant le pr\u00e9judice que Bell pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle subira si le sursis est refus\u00e9. Bell se fonde \u00e9galement sur l\u2019affidavit d\u2019un auxiliaire juridique qui inclut en pi\u00e8ce jointe, entre autres choses, certains documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans l\u2019affaire devant le CRTC, ainsi qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision et d\u2019autres documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans l\u2019affaire devant le Tribunal de la concurrence concernant la fusion entre Rogers et Shaw, soit Canada (Commissaire de la concurrence) c. Rogers Communications Inc. et Shaw Communications Inc., 2023 Trib Conc 1, conf. par 2023 CAF 16, 2023 CarswellNat 170 (Fusion Rogers Shaw).\n[32] La plupart des pr\u00e9judices all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans l\u2019affidavit de Mme Sheth sont fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se que le CRTC, \u00e0 la fin de son examen g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, n\u2019ordonnera pas de mani\u00e8re permanente \u00e0 Bell de donner acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ses installations FTTP au moyen de services AHV de gros group\u00e9s. \u00c0 ce moment-ci, c\u2019est de la pure conjecture.\n[33] En ce qui concerne plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment chacun des pr\u00e9judices all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, Bell ne fournit pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, documentaire ou autre, montrant en d\u00e9tail comment ou pourquoi elle perdrait vraisemblablement des clients ou des revenus de fa\u00e7on permanente. Bien que l\u2019affidavit de Mme Sheth mentionne, en passant, des pertes estim\u00e9es et hypoth\u00e9tiques, elle pr\u00e9sente peu d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments, voire aucun, justifiant les sommes ou les effets all\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\n[34] L\u2019estimation de Bell ne comporte pas les nuances requises. Par exemple, comme TekSavvy le souligne, les chiffres pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Bell ne font aucune distinction entre les diff\u00e9rents types de clients. Il n\u2019y a pas de distinction entre d\u2019une part les clients qui pourraient abandonner un concurrent fond\u00e9 sur les services de gros utilisant les lignes d\u2019acc\u00e8s d\u00e9di\u00e9es de Bell pour se tourner vers un concurrent fond\u00e9 sur les services de gros utilisant les installations FTTP de Bell, d\u2019autre part les clients qui pourraient se tourner vers un concurrent fond\u00e9 sur les services de gros qui utilise aussi les services FTTP de Bell ou encore les personnes qui ne sont pas des clients et qui pourraient s\u2019abonner \u00e0 un concurrent fond\u00e9 sur les services de gros utilisant les installations FTTP de Bell. Dans chacun de ces exemples, Bell gagnerait des revenus de vente de gros pour ces clients, mais les estimations g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es dans l\u2019affidavit de Mme Sheth n\u2019en tiennent pas compte.\n[35] \u00c0 mon avis, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur les pertes potentielles de parts de march\u00e9 produits par Bell dans l\u2019affidavit de Mme Sheth se comparent aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans l\u2019affaire Gateway City Church. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019\u00ab \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suffisamment probants, dont il ressort une forte probabilit\u00e9 que, faute de sursis, un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable soit in\u00e9vitablement caus\u00e9 \u00bb : Gateway City Church, au para. 16. Cet affidavit comprend plusieurs hypoth\u00e8ses et conjectures qui ne sont pas \u00e9tay\u00e9es par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et qui par cons\u00e9quent \u00ab n\u2019ont aucune valeur probante \u00bb : voir Glooscap, au para. 31.\n[36] Bell fonde \u00e9galement ses arguments relatifs \u00e0 la perte de parts de march\u00e9 et de revenus sur certains documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce devant le CRTC par TekSavvy et ORCC ainsi que sur la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal de la concurrence dans l\u2019affaire Fusion Rogers Shaw et des documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans cette affaire. Pourtant, aucun de ces documents n\u2019\u00e9tablit de forte probabilit\u00e9 que Bell perdra de mani\u00e8re irr\u00e9vocable des parts de march\u00e9 ou des revenus. Bien que le CRTC ait eu l\u2019intention, par sa d\u00e9cision, d\u2019accro\u00eetre la concurrence dans ce secteur, et que TekSavvy et ORCC aient indiqu\u00e9 dans leurs observations au CRTC qu\u2019elles croyaient que l\u2019acc\u00e8s temporaire envisag\u00e9 par le CRTC \u00e9tait requis, cela n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas de forte probabilit\u00e9 que Bell perdra des parts de march\u00e9 ou des revenus de mani\u00e8re permanente. Les intim\u00e9es font valoir de mani\u00e8re convaincante dans leurs documents en r\u00e9ponse que la possible intensification de la concurrence ne se traduira pas n\u00e9cessairement par une perte de parts de march\u00e9 pour Bell. En outre, Bell n\u2019a pas offert de pr\u00e9cisions montrant comment les tarifs de gros temporaires fix\u00e9s par le CRTC se comparent aux prix apr\u00e8s les rabais que Bell offre d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 certains de ses abonn\u00e9s.\n[37] Pour ce qui est de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal de la concurrence dans l\u2019affaire Fusion Rogers Shaw et des documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans cette affaire, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la d\u00e9claration de t\u00e9moin en r\u00e9ponse de Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lescadres, je ne vois pas comment ils prouvent quoi que ce soit de pertinent, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que cette affaire portait sur des services, des march\u00e9s et des questions qui diff\u00e8rent consid\u00e9rablement. Bien que le Tribunal de la concurrence ait reconnu que l\u2019acquisition de VMedia, un revendeur, par Vid\u00e9otron est un indice des plans d\u2019expansion en Ontario de Vid\u00e9otron, Bell n\u2019a pas offert d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve liant cette expansion \u00e0 une perte permanente de ses parts de march\u00e9 ou de ses revenus.\n[38] En ce qui concerne les co\u00fbts de mise en \u0153uvre irr\u00e9couvrables, l\u2019assurance du CRTC qu\u2019il peut r\u00e9soudre ces difficult\u00e9s, si n\u00e9cessaire, r\u00e9pond compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 cet argument, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Bell n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve montrant comment ou pourquoi le CRTC serait incapable de le faire. L\u2019affidavit de Mme Sheth n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas de mani\u00e8re convaincante que le CRTC ne pourrait pas fixer par ordonnance de nouveaux tarifs qui permettraient \u00e0 Bell de recouvrer les co\u00fbts engag\u00e9s pour mettre en \u0153uvre l\u2019acc\u00e8s temporaire si le CRTC d\u00e9cidait de ne pas ordonner de mani\u00e8re permanente de tel acc\u00e8s aux installations FTTP de Bell au moyen des services AHV de gros group\u00e9s \u00e0 la fin de son examen g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la politique.\n[39] Enfin, le propre choix de Bell de rediriger ou de couper des investissements ne constitue pas un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable, mais plut\u00f4t le choix d\u2019entreprise qu\u2019elle semble avoir fait en cons\u00e9quence de la d\u00e9cision du CRTC. En l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrant que la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019acc\u00e8s temporaire mettrait en danger l\u2019existence m\u00eame de Bell, je ne vois pas en quoi le fait qu\u2019elle proc\u00e8de aux investissements n\u00e9cessaires pour la mise en \u0153uvre de la d\u00e9cision du CRTC plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u2019autres investissements constitue un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable.\n[40] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, Bell n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u00e0 la satisfaction de la Cour \u00ab l\u2019existence r\u00e9elle d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice qui ne pourra \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9 plus tard, ou une r\u00e9elle probabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019un tel pr\u00e9judice soit subi \u00bb : Shotclose, au para. 48. Ses affirmations sont trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rales pour remplir la deuxi\u00e8me condition du crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald.\n[41] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les conditions du crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald sont conjonctives, l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de Bell d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019elle subira un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable signifie que la requ\u00eate en sursis doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que je me penche sur la troisi\u00e8me condition du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald, soit la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients.\n[42] Par cons\u00e9quent, je vais rejeter la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate et adjuger une seule s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9pens payables par Bell en parts \u00e9gales \u00e0 chacune des intim\u00e9es TekSavvy, QMI et ORCC.\n\u00ab Mary J.L.

Aux termes de son jugement, le juge Boyle rejetait des requ\u00eates de l\u2019appelant visant \u00e0 obtenir la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019appels log\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cotisations \u00e9mises \u00e0 son endroit pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 1999 \u00e0 2002 et 2005 mais \u00e9ventuellement r\u00e9gl\u00e9s par le syndic de faillite de l\u2019appelant en 2014. Ce r\u00e8glement a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la production, par le syndic, d\u2019avis de d\u00e9sistement dans chaque dossier.\n[2] L\u2019Entente sur le contenu du dossier d\u2019appel est, \u00e0 toutes fins utiles, le dernier acte de proc\u00e9dure utile produit au pr\u00e9sent dossier. Cela remonte au 20 septembre 2022.\n[3] L\u2019intim\u00e9 demande donc \u00e0 la Cour, dans une requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2023, de rejeter le pr\u00e9sent appel pour cause de retard injustifi\u00e9. Il en demande \u00e9galement le rejet sur la base qu\u2019il n\u2019a par ailleurs aucune chance de succ\u00e8s. Sur ce dernier point, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019avis d\u2019appel produit en l\u2019instance ne soul\u00e8ve aucune erreur de la part du juge Boyle. Par surcroit, dit-il, le pr\u00e9sent appel s\u2019ajouterait \u00e0 une longue liste de proc\u00e9dures initi\u00e9es sans succ\u00e8s par l\u2019appelant dans d\u2019autres dossiers le concernant ou concernant des personnes li\u00e9es, en vue de faire annuler les jugements rendus dans ces affaires ou remettre en cause des conclusions qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9es.\n[4] L\u2019appelant, qui, depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, est impliqu\u00e9 dans de nombreux litiges, de nature civile et p\u00e9nale, avec l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019ARC) et qui se dit victime \u00ab depuis 2006 \u00bb d\u2019une \u00ab fraude majeure \u00bb de la part de cette derni\u00e8re, a d\u2019abord pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour d\u00e9p\u00f4t, le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2023, ce qui se voulait son dossier de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Or, ce dossier a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u, mais non d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par le greffe de la Cour en raison de sa non-conformit\u00e9 aux exigences applicables des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, DORS\/98-106 (les R\u00e8gles). Le 22 d\u00e9cembre 2023, l\u2019intim\u00e9, pour les m\u00eames raisons, s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 au d\u00e9p\u00f4t dudit dossier. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a aussi contest\u00e9 le mode de signification utilis\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 72(1)b) des R\u00e8gles, le greffe a sollicit\u00e9 de la Cour une directive quant \u00e0 savoir si le dossier de r\u00e9ponse pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour d\u00e9p\u00f4t par l\u2019appelant devait \u00eatre accept\u00e9 ou refus\u00e9. J\u2019y reviendrai plus loin dans ces motifs.\n[5] Le 9 janvier 2024, l\u2019appelant a choisi de d\u00e9poser sa propre requ\u00eate dans l\u2019espoir de \u00ab corriger la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pour rejet d\u2019appel et de faire une mise \u00e0 jour avec de nombreuses nouvelles preuves \u00bb puisqu\u2019il lui paraissait n\u00e9cessaire de \u00ab refaire l\u2019affidavit et les pi\u00e8ces conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 306 des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales \u00bb.\n[6] L\u2019appelant, qui se repr\u00e9sente lui-m\u00eame, fait fausse route pour deux raisons. Premi\u00e8rement, sa requ\u00eate est fond\u00e9e sur les r\u00e8gles r\u00e9gissant les demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, lesquelles n\u2019ont aucune application en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un appel que l\u2019appelant a log\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la d\u00e9cision du juge Boyle. En appel, le \u00ab dossier \u00bb qui est devant la Cour est le \u00ab Dossier d\u2019appel \u00bb, tel que constitu\u00e9 aux termes des articles 343 et 344 des R\u00e8gles. Il n\u2019est pas constitu\u00e9 des affidavits et pi\u00e8ces des parties, comme ce serait le cas si la Cour \u00e9tait saisie d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. La requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelant d\u00e9note une incompr\u00e9hension des r\u00e8gles applicables. Il en r\u00e9sulte un vice de forme et de fond qui, \u00e0 lui seul, pourrait justifier son rejet.\n[7] Deuxi\u00e8mement, et plus important encore, m\u00eame en supposant la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelant r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement devant la Cour, on n\u2019y trouve rien qui satisfasse aux crit\u00e8res r\u00e9gissant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve nouvelle en appel, lesquels sont pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 351 des R\u00e8gles, tel qu\u2019interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 par la Cour. C\u2019est le cas aussi du dossier de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet d\u2019appel de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour d\u00e9p\u00f4t par l\u2019appelant.\n[8] Pour satisfaire \u00e0 ces crit\u00e8res, l\u2019appelant devait d\u00e9montrer que les nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019il souhaite introduire au dossier \u00ab 1) [\u2026] n\u2019auraient pas pu \u00eatre produits au proc\u00e8s avec diligence raisonnable, 2) [\u2026] sont pertinents, en ce sens qu\u2019ils portent sur une question d\u00e9cisive ou potentiellement d\u00e9cisive quant \u00e0 l\u2019appel, 3) [\u2026] sont plausibles, en ce sens qu\u2019on peut raisonnablement y ajouter foi, et 4) [\u2026] sont tels que si l\u2019on y ajoute foi, on peut raisonnablement penser qu\u2019ils auraient influ\u00e9 sur le r\u00e9sultat : Palmer c. la Reine, [1980] 1 R.C.S. 759, page 775, 1979 CanLII 8; May c. \u00c9tablissement Ferndale, 2005 CSC 82, [2005] 3 R.C.S. 809, au paragraphe 1071) \u00bb (Coady c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale), 2019 CAF 102 au para. 3 (Coady)).\n[9] Ce test est exigeant et l\u2019appelant devait en faire plus que de se contenter d\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9s vagues et g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. La principale lacune tient au fait qu\u2019on ne sait pas ce qui a emp\u00each\u00e9 l\u2019appelant, en faisant preuve de diligence raisonnable, de produire ses nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments au proc\u00e8s, surtout que l\u2019on sait du dossier que cette preuve aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverte \u00ab entre 2020 et 2022 \u00bb. On ne sait pas davantage si ces nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve portent sur une \u00ab question d\u00e9cisive ou potentiellement d\u00e9cisive quant \u00e0 l\u2019appel \u00bb. Cela, \u00e0 mon sens, est fatal \u00e0 la d\u00e9marche de l\u2019appelant. Le fait que l\u2019appelant ait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 sous le couvert d\u2019une demande de prorogation de d\u00e9lai n\u2019y change rien puisqu\u2019il demeurait tenu de d\u00e9montrer, notamment, que sa demande de pr\u00e9sentation de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve avait un certain m\u00e9rite (Alberta c. Canada, 2018 CAF 83, au para. 44, citant Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Hennelly (1999), 244 N.R. 399 (C.A.F.)). Or, cette d\u00e9monstration, comme on vient de le voir, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\n[10] La Cour devrait-elle toutefois exercer sa discr\u00e9tion et permettre le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve malgr\u00e9 le fait que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas satisfait aux crit\u00e8res de l\u2019article 351 des R\u00e8gles (Coady au para. 3)? J\u2019estime que non pour les raisons qui suivent.\n[11] Je note, du dossier de requ\u00eate produit par l\u2019intim\u00e9, que l\u2019approche emprunt\u00e9e ici par l\u2019appelant a toutes les allures du modus operandi observ\u00e9 dans d\u2019autres dossiers o\u00f9 chaque fois qu\u2019un jugement lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favorable, l\u2019appelant a invoqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9couverte de faits nouveaux en vue de le faire annuler ou encore a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9chapper aux cons\u00e9quences du jugement en ayant recours \u00e0 des moyens dilatoires. Je renvoie \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e0 la description qu\u2019en a fait la juge Roussel, maintenant juge \u00e0 notre Cour, dans Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (Re), 2018 CF 1012, au jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec dans Laquerre c. R., 2021 QCCA 157, et \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance rendue le 27 juin 2023 par la juge Rochester, aussi maintenant juge \u00e0 notre Cour, dans les dossiers de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale T-1594-06 et T-699-07. Toutes ces tentatives ont \u00e9chou\u00e9.\n[12] Je note aussi que dans son ordonnance, la juge Rochester n\u2019a pas manqu\u00e9 de souligner n\u2019avoir \u00ab aucun doute que [l\u2019appelant avait] eu toutes les opportunit\u00e9s de faire valoir ses droits depuis 2008 \u00bb et que \u00ab [m]algr\u00e9 cela, il persist[ait] \u00e0 utiliser les ressources judiciaires limit\u00e9es de la Cour pour des requ\u00eates non fond\u00e9es pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu de la R\u00e8gle 399 \u00bb. Il est utile de le rappeler que cette r\u00e8gle, et plus particuli\u00e8rement son paragraphe 399(2), permet de faire annuler une ordonnance dans les cas o\u00f9 \u00ab des faits nouveaux sont survenus ou ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s que l\u2019ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue \u00bb ou dans ceux o\u00f9 \u00ab l\u2019ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue par fraude \u00bb.\n[13] Il est utile de rappeler \u00e9galement que c\u2019est exactement ce qu\u2019a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 faire valoir l\u2019appelant, sous forme de requ\u00eates en r\u00e9ouverture de dossiers fond\u00e9es sur la d\u00e9couverte de faits nouveaux, devant le juge Boyle et, tout r\u00e9cemment, sans succ\u00e8s aussi, devant son coll\u00e8gue, le juge Gagnon, dans Fiducie Mario Laquerre c. Le Roi, 2024 CCI 5.\n[14] Dans un tel contexte, la plus grande vigilance est de mise et milite contre l\u2019exercice de la discr\u00e9tion r\u00e9siduaire d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019article 351 des R\u00e8gles. En d\u2019autres termes, il n\u2019y a pas mati\u00e8re \u00e0 relever l\u2019appelant du d\u00e9faut d\u2019avoir satisfait aux exigences de cette disposition. Sa requ\u00eate sera donc rejet\u00e9e.\n[15] Je reviens \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Normalement, le retard \u00e0 agir dans une proc\u00e9dure institu\u00e9e devant cette Cour est constat\u00e9 par un Avis de l\u2019examen de l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019instance \u00e9mis en vertu de l\u2019article 382.2 des R\u00e8gles. Cet avis enclenche alors une proc\u00e9dure de justification du d\u00e9lai \u00e0 agir qui peut mener soit au rejet de l\u2019acte introductif d\u2019instance, que ce soit un appel ou une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, soit \u00e0 la poursuite de l\u2019instance suivant les directives \u00e9mises par la Cour et le calendrier \u00e9tabli par elle. Aucun tel avis n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ce qui me fait h\u00e9siter \u00e0 faire droit \u00e0 ce volet de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Quant au volet li\u00e9 au fait que le pr\u00e9sent appel n\u2019aurait aucune chance de succ\u00e8s, j\u2019h\u00e9site aussi \u00e0 le consid\u00e9rer parce qu\u2019il invite \u00e0 un examen du fond de l\u2019appel alors que la Cour ne dispose que de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel pour ce faire. L\u2019\u00e9chantillon est donc trop mince pour faire un examen utile et complet des chances de succ\u00e8s, au m\u00e9rite, du pr\u00e9sent appel.\n[16] Ceci \u00e9tant dit, je ne rejetterai pas la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9; je vais la suspendre. En effet, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il s\u2019agit ici, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019historique judiciaire de l\u2019appelant, tel qu\u2019il se d\u00e9gage des affaires cit\u00e9es dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs auxquels il \u00e9tait parti, directement ou par l\u2019entremise de parties li\u00e9es, d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 la Cour doit exercer, d\u2019office, sa comp\u00e9tence pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re, laquelle lui conf\u00e8re les pouvoirs n\u00e9cessaires, au-del\u00e0 de ceux qui lui sont d\u00e9volus par la loi, pour assurer le bon d\u00e9roulement des instances devant elle de mani\u00e8re, notamment, \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir les abus de proc\u00e9dure (Dugr\u00e9 c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2021 CAF 8 aux para. 20-21).\n[17] Je vais donc permettre la poursuite du pr\u00e9sent appel, avec en arri\u00e8re-plan la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Toutefois, je vais assujettir l\u2019appel \u00e0 un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier que l\u2019appelant devra respecter \u00e0 la lettre. \u00c0 cette fin, les parties auront dix (10) jours \u00e0 compter de la date de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance pour s\u2019entendre sur un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier et le d\u00e9poser pour approbation par la Cour.\n[18] Cet \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier devra comprendre les \u00e9tapes suivantes :\na)Confection (\u00e0 partir de l\u2019entente sur le contenu du dossier d\u2019appel d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 22 septembre 2022) et d\u00e9p\u00f4t du Dossier d\u2019appel (article 345 des R\u00e8gles);\nb)Signification et d\u00e9p\u00f4t du m\u00e9moire des faits et du droit de l\u2019appelant (paragraphe 346(1) des R\u00e8gles);\nc)Signification et d\u00e9p\u00f4t du m\u00e9moire des faits et du droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9 (paragraphe 346(2) des R\u00e8gles);\nd)Signification et d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la demande d\u2019audience (article 347 des R\u00e8gles); et\ne)Signification et d\u00e9p\u00f4t du\/des cahier-s des lois, r\u00e8glements, jurisprudence et doctrine (article 348 des R\u00e8gles).\n[19] Si les parties n\u2019arrivent pas \u00e0 s\u2019entendre, la Cour, une fois le d\u00e9lai de dix (10) jours expir\u00e9, imposera alors un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier aux parties sans autre avis ni d\u00e9lai.\n[20] Une fois l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier \u00e9tabli, l\u2019intim\u00e9, en cas de d\u00e9faut de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 le respecter, aura le loisir de resoumettre sa requ\u00eate en rejet par l\u2019envoi \u2013 et la signification \u2013 d\u2019une simple lettre au greffe de la Cour. L\u2019appelant aura alors sept (7) jours \u00e0 compter de la date de signification de la lettre de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour signifier et d\u00e9poser une justification acceptable de son retard \u00e0 agir. Si la justification avanc\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas acceptable aux yeux de la Cour \u2013 ou si l\u2019appelant fait d\u00e9faut d\u2019en produire une dans ledit d\u00e9lai \u2013 le pr\u00e9sent appel pourra \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, sans autre avis ni d\u00e9lai.\n[21] Par ailleurs, pour plus de clart\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la suite des choses, l\u2019examen du jugement du juge Boyle devra \u00e9ventuellement se faire, comme l\u2019intim\u00e9 le mentionne \u00e0 juste titre dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelant, \u00e0 partir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019il avait devant lui, du moins ceux qui sont r\u00e9pertori\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019entente sur le contenu du dossier d\u2019appel d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en septembre 2022. Il appartiendra alors \u00e0 la Cour de d\u00e9terminer si, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve qu\u2019il avait devant lui, le juge Boyle, en rejetant les requ\u00eates en r\u00e9ouverture de dossiers de l\u2019appelant, a commis une erreur justifiant son intervention.\n[22] Finalement, quant au sort du dossier de r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet d\u2019appel, je n\u2019en ai pas autoris\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t dans une directive \u00e9mise en date de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, en raison de ses nombreuses lacunes : aucun intitul\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019affidavit, pi\u00e8ces non\u2011asserment\u00e9es ou non\u2011mentionn\u00e9es dans l\u2019affidavit, dossier non\u2011pagin\u00e9, absence d\u2019une table des mati\u00e8res et documents ne respectant pas l\u2019ordre dans lequel ils doivent apparaitre au dossier.\n[23] Toutefois, cela, \u00e0 mon sens, est sans cons\u00e9quence puisque j\u2019ai consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelant, laquelle visait \u00e0 rectifier le tir de sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet.\n[24] Il n\u2019y aura pas d\u2019adjudication de d\u00e9pens, puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne les a pas demand\u00e9s dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelant.\n\u00ab Ren\u00e9 LeBlanc \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\nA-168-22\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nMARIO LAQUERRE c.

La division d\u2019appel a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de la demanderesse, Diane Beaurivage, d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale (la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale). L\u2019appel devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale concernait une d\u00e9cision de la Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada (la Commission) qui a rejet\u00e9 une demande de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi par Mme Beaurivage puisqu\u2019elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait toujours de l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire pay\u00e9 par son employeur apr\u00e8s la fin de son emploi.\n[2] Nous sommes d\u2019avis que la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e est celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. Nous ne retenons pas l\u2019argument de Mme Beaurivage que la norme de contr\u00f4le devrait plut\u00f4t \u00eatre celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte. Devant notre Cour, la pr\u00e9somption en mati\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le judiciaire veut que nous consid\u00e9rions la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e suivant la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. \u00c0 notre avis, et contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019argument de Mme Beaurivage, les questions soulev\u00e9es dans cette demande ne figurent pas parmi les exceptions \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9somption \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653 (Vavilov). Mais quoi qu\u2019il en soit, nous sommes d\u2019avis que, quelle que soit la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable, cette affaire ne peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[3] D\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, il est utile de rappeler ce qui suit quant aux r\u00f4les de la division d\u2019appel et la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. La division d\u2019appel peut accorder un appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale seulement dans les cas o\u00f9 cette derni\u00e8re (i) n\u2019a pas observ\u00e9 un principe de justice naturelle ou a autrement exc\u00e9d\u00e9 ou refus\u00e9 d\u2019exercer sa comp\u00e9tence, (ii) a rendu une d\u00e9cision entach\u00e9e d\u2019une erreur de droit, ou (iii) a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une conclusion de fait erron\u00e9e, tir\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance : Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l'emploi et du d\u00e9veloppement social, L.C. 2005, c. 34, art. 58. Le r\u00f4le de la division d\u2019appel est donc limit\u00e9. \u00c0 titre comparatif, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale entend un appel de la Commission de novo : Page c.

Sa d\u00e9cision n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre limit\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision de la Commission.\n[4] Mme Beaurivage affirme que la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e en sa faveur compte tenu du fait qu\u2019en 2016 la Commission lui avait accord\u00e9 des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi, tout en \u00e9tant pleinement consciente qu\u2019elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire pay\u00e9 par son employeur. Nous ne pouvons pas retenir cet argument. Premi\u00e8rement, il est loin d\u2019\u00eatre clair que la Commission est li\u00e9e, lorsqu\u2019elle d\u00e9cide une demande de prestations, par une d\u00e9cision sur une autre demande de prestations faite dans le pass\u00e9 par la m\u00eame personne. Chaque demande d\u2019assurance-emploi est tributaire des faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission et du droit applicable au moment o\u00f9 la demande est faite. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je note que dans sa d\u00e9cision, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision de la division d\u2019appel (R.B. c. Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada, 2018 TSS 754) qui semble appuyer la d\u00e9cision de la Commission dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier en ce qui concerne l\u2019usage du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire de Mme Beaurivage pour les fins de la demande de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi en cause ici. Mme Beaurivage a par ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e d\u2019une autre d\u00e9cision de la division d\u2019appel au m\u00eame effet pendant une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique le 14 ao\u00fbt 2020 (voir la page 40 du dossier de la demanderesse).\n[5] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, puisque l\u2019appel d\u2019une telle d\u00e9cision devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est de novo, il est clair que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure de la Commission. Donc, la division d\u2019appel avait raison de conclure que la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion ne s\u2019appliquait pas dans ce cas.\n[6] En ce qui concerne l\u2019argument subsidiaire de Mme Beaurivage qu\u2019il y a aussi un abus de proc\u00e9dure, nous arrivons \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion, et ce, pour les m\u00eames raisons d\u00e9crites ci-dessus.\n[7] Mme Beaurivage demande aussi, dans le cas o\u00f9 nous ne retenons pas ses arguments sur le fond de sa demande, que nous recommandions \u00e0 la Commission \u00ab d\u2019user [de] son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et d\u2019ordonner la d\u00e9falcation des sommes dues dans tous les dossiers afin de mettre fin au litige avec la Demanderesse \u00bb. Nous refusons cette demande. Le r\u00f4le de cette Cour est d\u2019entendre des demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire des d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale sur des appels des d\u00e9cisions de la Commission. Il serait inappropri\u00e9 de donner suite \u00e0 la recommandation vis\u00e9e par Mme Beaurivage, surtout que cette question pourrait \u00e9ventuellement \u00eatre port\u00e9e devant notre Cour.\n[8] En conclusion, nous rejetons la demande. Puisque le d\u00e9fendeur ne demande pas des d\u00e9pens, nous n\u2019en accordons aucun.\n\u00ab George R.

La plainte concernait la nomination d\u2019une tierce partie \u00e0 un poste auquel s\u2019int\u00e9ressait Mme Fortin.\n[2] La Commission a rejet\u00e9 la plainte parce qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai prescrit. La Commission a conclu qu\u2019aucune circonstance exceptionnelle ne justifiait la prorogation dudit d\u00e9lai, un d\u00e9lai de rigueur.\n[3] Mme Fortin explique qu\u2019au moment de la notification de la nomination contest\u00e9e (le 13 juillet 2022), elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie li\u00e9 \u00e0 un trouble de stress post-traumatique. Elle ajoute que son m\u00e9decin avait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de communiquer de vive voix avec ses sup\u00e9rieurs hi\u00e9rarchiques. En raison de son absence du bureau, elle a seulement pris connaissance de la notification de la nomination contest\u00e9e le 21 juillet 2022. Quand elle a demand\u00e9 des renseignements concernant la nomination, on lui a offert de lui fournir des explications par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Apr\u00e8s avoir indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait une explication \u00e9crite (vraisemblablement en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience), une telle explication lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie le 28 juillet 2022. Toutefois, il semble que cette explication ne l\u2019a pas satisfaite; elle a simplement reformul\u00e9 sa question.\n[4] Le d\u00e9lai pour pr\u00e9senter une plainte concernant la nomination contest\u00e9e expirait le 28 juillet 2022, soit 15 jours suivant la date figurant sur la notification : art. 10 du R\u00e8glement concernant les plaintes relatives \u00e0 la dotation dans la fonction publique, DORS\/2006-6 (le R\u00e8glement). Mme Fortin n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa plainte que le 3 ao\u00fbt 2022.\n[5] Suite au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, le SCC a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de la rejeter pour non-respect du d\u00e9lai. Le SCC s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande subs\u00e9quente de Mme Fortin pour proroger ce d\u00e9lai. Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u des courriels de Mme Fortin les 9, 10 et 11 ao\u00fbt 2022 portant sur les d\u00e9fis caus\u00e9s par sa d\u00e9ficience, la Commission a conclu, tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, que le d\u00e9lai pour d\u00e9poser la plainte n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9, et que le crit\u00e8re de circonstances exceptionnelles n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait. En particulier, la Commission a not\u00e9 que \u00ab la plaignante avait la responsabilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser sa plainte dans le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu et elle n'a pas expliqu\u00e9 comment sa d\u00e9ficience a cr\u00e9\u00e9 des circonstances exceptionnelles l'emp\u00eachant de respecter ce d\u00e9lai. \u00bb\n[6] La norme de contr\u00f4le applicable \u00e0 cette demande est celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable, sauf en ce qui concerne des questions d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale: Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653. Ceci veut dire que, pour les questions qui ne concernent pas l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, nous n\u2019interviendrons que dans le cas o\u00f9 Mme Fortin nous convainc que les motifs de la Commission sont d\u00e9raisonnables. Notre r\u00f4le, il est important de le noter, n\u2019est pas de refaire la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. En d\u2019autres termes, il n\u2019est pas de r\u00e9\u00e9valuer la demande qui \u00e9tait devant la Commission, et d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 notre propre conclusion sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de cette demande. Pour les questions d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, nous nous demandons si la proc\u00e9dure devant la Commission \u00e9tait \u00e9quitable.\n[7] \u00c0 mon avis, il \u00e9tait loisible \u00e0 la Commission, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve qu\u2019elle avait devant elle, de conclure au non-respect du d\u00e9lai de 15 jours. Elle pouvait aussi conclure \u00e0 l\u2019absence de circonstances exceptionnelles en raison du manque de preuve concernant le lien entre sa d\u00e9ficience et le non-respect du d\u00e9lai.\n[8] Mme Fortin reconnait qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli ce lien devant la Commission, mais affirme que cette lacune d\u00e9montre en soi son incapacit\u00e9. M\u00eame si j\u2019acceptais son argument, je suis d\u2019avis que la Commission pouvait n\u00e9anmoins raisonnablement conclure, selon la preuve qui \u00e9tait devant elle, que le crit\u00e8re de circonstances exceptionnelles n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait.\n[9] Mme Fortin note qu\u2019elle se repr\u00e9sentait seule devant la Commission, et affirme que si une audience avait eu lieu quant \u00e0 sa demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e de l\u2019importance de fournir la preuve m\u00e9dicale, ce qu\u2019elle aurait fait. Ceci semble \u00eatre un argument d\u2019un manquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale d\u00fb au d\u00e9faut de tenir une audience avant que la Commission ne rende sa d\u00e9cision. Je note que l\u2019article 27 du R\u00e8glement pr\u00e9voit que la Commission est \u00ab ma\u00eetre de la proc\u00e9dure \u00bb, et qu\u2019elle peut d\u00e9cider de la mani\u00e8re dont la preuve sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. \u00c0 mon avis, la Commission n\u2019avait aucune obligation de tenir une audience. Mme Fortin a eu l\u2019occasion de d\u00e9poser des repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites qui \u00e9tayaient sa position. Dans les circonstances, on ne peut reprocher \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019avoir manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son devoir d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de Mme Fortin.\n[10] Mme Fortin all\u00e8gue aussi que la Commission l\u2019a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en ne prenant aucune mesure d\u2019adaptation en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Je ne peux pas retenir cet argument puisqu\u2019il est circulaire. En l\u2019absence de preuve devant la Commission de la pertinence de sa d\u00e9ficience quant au non-respect du d\u00e9lai, celle-ci n\u2019avait aucune raison de croire qu\u2019une mesure d\u2019adaptation \u00e9tait souhaitable. La Commission n\u2019a pas err\u00e9 non plus \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[11] Je conclus en notant que m\u00eame les rapports m\u00e9dicaux soumis avec le dossier de Mme Fortin n\u2019indiquent pas qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait incapable de respecter le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu. Tel qu\u2019il appert de son m\u00e9moire et de ses repr\u00e9sentations \u00e0 l\u2019audience, je note \u00e9galement que bien des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de justification du non-respect du d\u00e9lai n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Commission. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, Mme Fortin indique, aux paragraphes 39 et suivants de son m\u00e9moire, qu\u2019avec le recul, elle est maintenant en mesure de mieux expliquer \u00e0 la Cour les raisons de son d\u00e9faut \u00e0 respecter ce d\u00e9lai, et ce, dans l\u2019espoir que, par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, cette Cour proroge elle-m\u00eame ledit d\u00e9lai. Malheureusement pour elle, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, notre r\u00f4le se limite \u00e0 examiner la d\u00e9cision de la Commission \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qu\u2019elle avait devant elle. En d\u2019autres mots, nous ne pouvons rendre la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la place de la Commission \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de faits qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019occasion de consid\u00e9rer.\n[12] Pour les raisons ci-dessus, et malgr\u00e9 la sympathie que j\u2019\u00e9prouve pour Mme Fortin, je suis d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est raisonnable, et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas enfreint l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Je rejetterais la demande, incluant toutes les r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es par Mme Fortin.\n[13] Puisque le d\u00e9fendeur ne demande pas des d\u00e9pens, je n\u2019en accorderais aucun.\n[14] Je suis d\u2019accord avec le d\u00e9fendeur que l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de cause devrait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 pour remplacer le Commissaire du service correctionnel du Canada par le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada.\n\u00ab George R.

Me mettant \u00e0 la place de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et appliquant la norme de contr\u00f4le appropri\u00e9e, je conclus que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est d\u00e9raisonnable parce que ses motifs sur cet aspect de la D\u00e9cision ne font pas \u00e9tat d\u2019une analyse rationnelle et parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019ensemble du droit et des faits pertinents. Cependant, j\u2019exercerais mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de r\u00e9paration en n\u2019annulant pas la D\u00e9cision et en ne renvoyant pas l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la Commission pour une nouvelle d\u00e9cision puisque la seule d\u00e9cision raisonnable, compte tenu des contraintes juridiques et factuelles applicables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, serait de rejeter la Plainte.\nI. Contexte [3] Il sera utile de pr\u00e9senter le contexte entourant les questions soulev\u00e9es dans le pr\u00e9sent appel.\nA. Contexte l\u00e9gislatif [4] La Loi interdit plusieurs actes discriminatoires. Notamment, elle interdit, \u00e0 l\u2019article 7, le fait de refuser de continuer d\u2019employer un individu ou de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi pour un motif de distinction illicite, dont la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et la couleur. La Loi interdit \u00e9galement, \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)a), le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi pour un motif de distinction illicite. \u00c0 l\u2019article 14.1, la Loi interdit \u00e0 la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte de discrimination sous la Loi, ou la personne qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[5] Aux termes du paragraphe 40(1), sous r\u00e9serve de certaines conditions de recevabilit\u00e9 qui ne sont pas applicables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les personnes ayant des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019une personne a commis un acte discriminatoire peuvent d\u00e9poser une plainte devant la Commission.\n[6] Lorsqu\u2019elle re\u00e7oit une plainte, la Commission peut refuser de statuer sur la plainte dont elle est saisie si elle la juge irrecevable pour un des motifs d\u00e9finis au paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi :\nIrrecevabilit\u00e9\nCommission to deal with complaint\n41 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 40, la Commission statue sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle estime celle-ci irrecevable pour un des motifs suivants :\n41 (1) Subject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that\na) la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de l\u2019acte discriminatoire devrait \u00e9puiser d\u2019abord les recours internes ou les proc\u00e9dures d\u2019appel ou de r\u00e8glement des griefs qui lui sont normalement ouverts;\n(a) the alleged victim of the discriminatory practice to which the complaint relates ought to exhaust grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available;\nb) la plainte pourrait avantageusement \u00eatre instruite, dans un premier temps ou \u00e0 toutes les \u00e9tapes, selon des proc\u00e9dures pr\u00e9vues par une autre loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale;\n(b) the complaint is one that could more appropriately be dealt with, initially or completely, according to a procedure provided for under an Act of Parliament other than this Act;\nc) la plainte n\u2019est pas de sa comp\u00e9tence;\n(c) the complaint is beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission;\nd) la plainte est frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi;\n(d) the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith; or\ne) la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration d\u2019un d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an apr\u00e8s le dernier des faits sur lesquels elle est fond\u00e9e, ou de tout d\u00e9lai sup\u00e9rieur que la Commission estime indiqu\u00e9 dans les circonstances.\n(e) the complaint is based on acts or omissions the last of which occurred more than one year, or such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances, before receipt of the complaint.\n[7] En vertu du paragraphe 43(1), la Commission peut charger une personne (\u00ab l\u2019enqu\u00eateur \u00bb) d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur une plainte et, une fois l\u2019enqu\u00eate termin\u00e9e, de pr\u00e9senter un rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e0 la Commission selon le paragraphe 44(1).\n[8] La Commission exerce alors un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, d\u00e9fini aux paragraphes 44(2) et (3), pour d\u00e9cider comment donner suite au rapport. L\u2019une des options pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 44(3) est de demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal des droits de la personne (\u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte. Le Tribunal tient alors une audience, donnant \u00e0 la Commission et aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et leurs observations afin de trancher les questions de fait et de droit soulev\u00e9es par la plainte. L\u2019autre option est de rejeter la plainte si la Commission est convaincue que son examen n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des circonstances applicables ou que la plainte n\u2019est pas recevable pour un des motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s aux alin\u00e9as 41(1)c) \u00e0 e).\n[9] L\u2019article 48 de la Loi traite de la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e8glements. Elle pr\u00e9voit que les parties peuvent tenter de r\u00e9gler leurs diff\u00e9rends \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte mais avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience au Tribunal : Loi, art. 48(1). Tout r\u00e8glement doit \u00eatre approuv\u00e9 par la Commission, apr\u00e8s quoi, par requ\u00eate d\u2019une des parties ou de la Commission, il peut \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 comme telle: Loi, art. 48(2)\u2013(3).\nB. Contexte factuel [10] Cet appel s\u2019inscrit dans la foul\u00e9e d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de proc\u00e9dures judiciaires et administratives intent\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante sur une p\u00e9riode de vingt ans devant la Commission, le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un traitement par son ancien employeur qu\u2019elle juge avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 discriminatoire. Afin de replacer le Jugement dans son contexte factuel, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner l\u2019historique de ces proc\u00e9dures.\n(1) La plainte de 2003 et le protocole d\u2019entente [11] L\u2019appelante, Mme Marie Mache Rameau, a \u0153uvr\u00e9 dans la fonction publique du Canada de 1990 \u00e0 2014 quand son poste a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019un r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement des effectifs. L\u2019appelante a notamment travaill\u00e9 au sein de l\u2019Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international (l\u2019ACDI), qui fait \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent partie d\u2019Affaires mondiales Canada.\n[12] Le 28 juillet 2003, l\u2019appelante d\u00e9pose aupr\u00e8s de la Commission une premi\u00e8re plainte (la plainte de 2003) all\u00e9guant qu\u2019en cours d\u2019emploi, l\u2019ACDI s\u2019est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 de la discrimination et \u00e0 du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9s sur la race contrairement aux articles 7 et 14 de la Loi. La Commission achemine la plainte de 2003 au Tribunal en d\u00e9cembre 2005.\n[13] Avant que la plainte de 2003 ne soit instruite devant le Tribunal et \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation, les parties signent, le 29 novembre 2006, un protocole d\u2019entente (le protocole) pour r\u00e9soudre les all\u00e9gations soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte de 2003.\n[14] Au paragraphe 10 du protocole, l\u2019appelante convient que ce dernier \u00ab repr\u00e9sente un r\u00e8glement d\u00e9finitif [\u00e0] l\u2019\u00e9gard de tous les incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans [la plainte de 2003] et lib\u00e8re et d\u00e9charge pour toujours l\u2019intim\u00e9e [\u2026] de toute r\u00e9clamation ou cause d\u2019action d\u00e9coulant des all\u00e9gations faites dans la plainte. \u00bb\n[15] Les parties pr\u00e9voient aux paragraphes 14 \u00e0 16 du protocole les moyens par lesquels ce r\u00e8glement sera ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 :\n14. Les parties reconnaissent que la Commission fera le suivi du r\u00e8glement, une fois approuv\u00e9, afin d\u2019assurer la mise en \u0153uvre des modalit\u00e9s tel que convenues dans cette entente.\n15. Les parties consentent \u00e0 ce que ce r\u00e8glement soit assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et soit ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 comme telle en vertu du paragraphe 48(3) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n16. Une fois le r\u00e8glement approuv\u00e9 par la Commission, dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d\u2019un d\u00e9saccord concernant la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ses conditions, les parties conviennent de reprendre la m\u00e9diation afin de ren\u00e9gocier les points en litige. Les parties conviennent \u00e9galement que la modification sera soumise [\u00e0] l\u2019approbation de la Commission conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 48 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et que celle-ci aura force ex\u00e9cutoire en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale selon les m\u00eames modalit\u00e9s que le r\u00e8glement initial.\n[16] La Commission approuve l\u2019entente et le 17 janvier 2007, le Tribunal arr\u00eate les proc\u00e9dures et ferme son dossier.\n[17] En vertu des paragraphes 4 et 5 du protocole, l\u2019appelante est nomm\u00e9e \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire dans un poste au groupe et niveau PE-04 et affect\u00e9e dans un poste au sein de la Commission de la fonction publique (CFP) pour une p\u00e9riode de 12 mois en vertu d\u2019une entente d\u2019affectation, aux frais de l\u2019ACDI, convenue entre la CFP et l\u2019ACDI. L\u2019appelante compl\u00e8te sa formation \u00e0 la CFP et son affectation est reconduite, cette fois aux frais de la CFP, pour une autre p\u00e9riode de 12 mois.\n[18] Le 16 f\u00e9vrier 2009, au terme de cette deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode d\u2019affectation, l\u2019appelante r\u00e9int\u00e8gre son poste au sein de l\u2019ACDI au niveau PE-03. Elle demande alors d\u2019\u00eatre nomm\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste de niveau PE-04 en vertu du paragraphe 6 du protocole :\n6. Dans le cas o\u00f9 la plaignante ne r\u00e9ussi (sic) pas la formation dans les six premiers mois de son affectation \u00e0 la Commission de la fonction publique, la plaignante retourne au sein de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au poste de PE-3. L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019engage \u00e0 lui offrir une formation de 18 mois. Moyennant le r\u00e9sultat positif de l\u2019\u00e9valuation trimestrielle bas\u00e9 sur des objectifs clairs et pr\u00e9cis ainsi que des crit\u00e8res d\u2019\u00e9valuation, la plaignante sera nomm\u00e9e au niveau PE-4 via un processus non annonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode de formation de 18 mois.\n[19] Selon l\u2019appelante, l\u2019ACDI s\u2019engage, au paragraphe 6, \u00e0 lui fournir une formation de 18 mois et \u00e0 la nommer \u00e0 un poste PE-04 peu importe le moment de son retour \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI. L\u2019ACDI retient une interpr\u00e9tation fort diff\u00e9rente du paragraphe 6. Elle soutient qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019engage \u00e0 remplir les obligations qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es que si l\u2019appelante ne r\u00e9ussit pas sa formation \u00e0 la CFP et revient \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI dans les six premiers mois. Selon elle, puisque l\u2019appelante a compl\u00e9t\u00e9 sa formation \u00e0 la CFP, le \u00ab Plan B \u00bb formul\u00e9 au paragraphe 6 ne s\u2019applique pas.\n[20] Vu ce d\u00e9saccord quant \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du protocole, les parties tentent, en vertu du paragraphe 16 du protocole, de reprendre la m\u00e9diation par l\u2019entremise de la Commission afin de ren\u00e9gocier les points en litige. Le processus de m\u00e9diation est infructueux et l\u2019ACDI s\u2019en retire le 7 mars 2012.\n[21] Le 11 avril 2012, l\u2019appelante apprend que son poste est touch\u00e9 par un r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement des effectifs.\n[22] Le 28 mai 2012, l\u2019appelante d\u00e9pose, aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, la Plainte all\u00e9guant que l\u2019ACDI a contrevenu au protocole, l\u2019a soumise \u00e0 un traitement discriminatoire en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi et a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle en se soustrayant de ses obligations sous le protocole et en prenant d\u2019autres mesures d\u00e9favorables contre elle. Je reviendrai au traitement de la Plainte ci-dessous dans la section I. B. 3) de ces motifs.\n(2) Tentatives de l\u2019appelante de faire ex\u00e9cuter et interpr\u00e9ter le protocole [23] Le 29 mai 2012, apr\u00e8s que l\u2019ACDI se soit retir\u00e9e du processus de m\u00e9diation pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 16 du protocole et visant la ren\u00e9gociation des points en litige quant \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre du protocole, \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019appelante et conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 15 du protocole, le juge Pinard de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rend une ordonnance assimilant le protocole \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en vertu du paragraphe 48(3) de la Loi.\n[24] L\u2019appelante demande alors \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019\u00e9mettre une ordonnance de justification \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la pr\u00e9sidente de l\u2019ACDI, plaidant qu\u2019en refusant de la nommer \u00e0 un poste PE-04, elle a viol\u00e9 le protocole, assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et a donc commis un outrage au tribunal. Le 2 novembre 2012, dans la d\u00e9cision Rameau c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 1286, [2012] A.C.F. no 1641 (Q.L.) (le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage), le juge Boivin (maintenant juge \u00e0 cette Cour) rejette la requ\u00eate. Vu l\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 du paragraphe 6 du protocole, qui n\u2019\u00e9nonce pas clairement la conduite des parties, il d\u00e9cide qu\u2019il ne peut y avoir une violation d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e du protocole et donc un outrage au tribunal. Il d\u00e9termine aussi que les faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties n\u2019\u00e9tablissent pas que le d\u00e9roulement des n\u00e9gociations entreprises en vertu du paragraphe 16 du protocole puisse \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 un outrage : Jugement sur l\u2019outrage au para. 20. L\u2019appelante ne porte pas le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage en appel.\n[25] Le 16 janvier 2013, l\u2019appelante demande au Tribunal de trancher une question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation portant sur l\u2019application du paragraphe 6 du protocole.\n[26] Le 26 ao\u00fbt 2014, le Tribunal refuse de se saisir du d\u00e9saccord portant sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019application du protocole : Mache-Rameau c. Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international, 2014 TCDP 26, [2014] D.C.D.P. no 26 (Q.L.) (Rameau TCDP). Il fait valoir que sa comp\u00e9tence est tributaire des plaintes dont il est saisi par la Commission. Puisqu\u2019il a ferm\u00e9 son dossier quant \u00e0 la plainte de 2003 \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019approbation du protocole par la Commission et avant qu\u2019il n\u2019instruise cette plainte, il ne peut accueillir la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelante de se saisir de ce dossier afin d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le protocole : Rameau TCDP aux para. 52\u201354.\n[27] Le Tribunal prend acte du fait que les parties conviennent, au paragraphe 15 du protocole, que le protocole soit assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et, au paragraphe 16, que toute modification au protocole n\u00e9goci\u00e9e par les parties afin de r\u00e9gler un d\u00e9saccord concernant sa mise en \u0153uvre ait aussi force ex\u00e9cutoire en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il d\u00e9cide que ces dispositions ont pour effet de lui retirer \u00ab de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive toute comp\u00e9tence [\u2026] au regard de ce protocole d\u2019entente, lequel a identifi\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comme \u00e9tant le nouveau forum l\u00e9gal applicable afin de r\u00e9gler toute m\u00e9sentente en ce qui a trait \u00e0 ce protocole d\u2019entente sign\u00e9 entre les parties \u00bb : Rameau TCDP au para. 58.\n[28] L\u2019appelante d\u00e9pose \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une demande en contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. Le 19 octobre 2015, dans la d\u00e9cision Rameau c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CF 1180, [2015] A.C.F. no 1212 (Q.L.) (le Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal), le juge Roy rejette sa demande. Il d\u00e9cide que \u00ab le Tribunal avait raison d\u2019affirmer qu\u2019il ne pouvait disposer de la question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que voulait lui soumettre la demanderesse \u00bb et que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal \u00e9tait donc \u00ab correcte \u00bb : Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal au para. 21.\n[29] Selon le juge Roy, la comp\u00e9tence conf\u00e9r\u00e9e au Tribunal est d\u2019instruire une plainte. Aucune instruction de la plainte de 2003 n\u2019avait eu lieu, puisqu\u2019elle avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un r\u00e8glement complet et d\u00e9finitif. Sans instruction de plainte, le Tribunal, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait ni partie au r\u00e8glement ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 par la Commission ni partie \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance d\u2019une Cour, \u00e9tait sans comp\u00e9tence.\n[30] Le juge Roy se dit aussi d\u2019avis, au paragraphe 38, \u00ab qu\u2019un poids certain doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9 au fait que l\u2019entente, le r\u00e8glement, soit devenue une ordonnance de cette Cour \u00bb. \u00c0 ce titre, le juge Roy observe que le Tribunal, en expliquant que le protocole lui retirait, en faveur de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, toute comp\u00e9tence au regard du protocole, constatait son absence de comp\u00e9tence d\u2019agir au sujet du protocole devenu ordonnance de la Cour : Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal aux para. 45\u201346.\n[31] L\u2019appelante ne porte pas le Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal en appel.\n(3) La Plainte [32] Dans la Plainte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission le 28 mai 2012, l\u2019appelante all\u00e8gue que l\u2019ACDI a contrevenu au protocole, qu\u2019elle est victime d\u2019un traitement discriminatoire en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi sur la base de sa race, de sa couleur et de son origine nationale ou ethnique et que l\u2019ACDI a fait preuve de discrimination en exer\u00e7ant des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle, y compris en se soustrayant \u00e0 ses obligations telles que stipul\u00e9es dans le protocole et en prenant d\u2019autres mesures d\u00e9favorables contre elle. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle affirme que l\u2019ACDI a contrevenu au protocole en ne la nommant pas au niveau PE-04 \u00e0 son retour d\u2019affectation \u00e0 la CFP en f\u00e9vrier 2009, que l\u2019ACDI refuse toujours de reconna\u00eetre ses comp\u00e9tences et qu\u2019elle est victime d\u2019un refus syst\u00e9matique de toute possibilit\u00e9 de promotion ou d\u2019avancement au-del\u00e0 du niveau PE-03 ainsi que de repr\u00e9sailles et de harc\u00e8lement.\n[33] D\u2019embl\u00e9e, l\u2019ACDI, la mise en cause dans la Plainte, demande \u00e0 la Commission de se prononcer sur la recevabilit\u00e9 de la Plainte en vertu de l\u2019article 41 de la Loi \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des proc\u00e9dures intent\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale afin de faire ex\u00e9cuter le protocole, d\u00e9sormais assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour.\n[34] Une enqu\u00eatrice de la Commission (la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice) examine si le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage prononc\u00e9 par le juge Boivin avait trait\u00e9 des questions des droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la Plainte, la rendant vexatoire au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)d) de la Loi. Dans un rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate du 21 mars 2013 (le Rapport sur la recevabilit\u00e9), elle conclut que la Plainte compte des all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans son Jugement sur l\u2019outrage et que la Plainte, n\u2019\u00e9tant pas vexatoire au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)d) de la Loi, n\u2019est pas irrecevable. En particulier, elle constate que la Plainte inclut des all\u00e9gations additionnelles, notamment, l\u2019all\u00e9gation que la suppression du poste de l\u2019appelante constitue une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles :\nBien que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a (sic) rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de la plaignante, les questions des droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la plainte n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour et il y a des all\u00e9gations dans la plainte qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour non plus. De plus, la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise dans le contexte d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure d\u2019outrage, ce qui soul\u00e8ve des consid\u00e9rations diff\u00e9rentes et un fardeau de preuve distinct d\u2019une plainte \u00e0 la Commission.\nL\u2019enqu\u00eatrice recommande donc que la Commission statue sur la Plainte.\n[35] Le 19 juin 2013, s\u2019appuyant sur le Rapport sur la recevabilit\u00e9 et les repr\u00e9sentations des parties, la Commission d\u00e9cide que la Plainte \u00ab contient des all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb et que par cons\u00e9quent, elle n\u2019est pas vexatoire au sens de l\u2019article 41 (la D\u00e9cision sur la recevabilit\u00e9). Elle charge donc une enqu\u00eatrice de la Plainte (la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice).\n[36] Dans un rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate du 27 mars 2014 (le Rapport), la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice recommande \u00e0 la Commission de rejeter la Plainte en vertu du sous-alin\u00e9a 44(3)b)(i) de la Loi au motif que, compte tenu des circonstances, l\u2019examen de la Plainte par le Tribunal n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9.\n[37] Dans le Rapport, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au Jugement sur l\u2019outrage et \u00e0 la conclusion du juge Boivin selon laquelle les faits n\u2019\u00e9tayaient pas la pr\u00e9tention que le d\u00e9roulement des n\u00e9gociations en vertu du paragraphe 16 du protocole puisse \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 un outrage. Elle conclut :\nDe ce fait, les all\u00e9gations concernant la contravention du protocole d\u2019entente ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par un autre processus et la Commission ne traitera pas de ces all\u00e9gations. Cependant, quant aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles et de discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, le 19 juin 2013, de statuer sur la plainte en vertu du paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne parce que la plainte contient des all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[Je souligne.]\n[38] Bien qu\u2019elle exclut de son enqu\u00eate un traitement des all\u00e9gations concernant le non-respect du protocole, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice examine trois all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans la Plainte :\na)que l\u2019appelante s\u2019est vue refuser toute possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir un emploi, une promotion, une affectation int\u00e9rimaire ou tout autre occasion emploi;\nb)qu\u2019elle a subi un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel n\u00e9gatif dans le cadre de son emploi lorsque l\u2019ACDI ne lui a pas offert de possibilit\u00e9 de formation en dotation;\nc)qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de l\u2019ACDI, qui l\u2019a maintenue \u00e0 un niveau PE-03 et a bloqu\u00e9 ses avancements de carri\u00e8re du fait qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la Commission et parce qu\u2019elle a exerc\u00e9 ses droits en disputant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du protocole. De ce fait, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gativement affect\u00e9e par le r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement des effectifs qui a touch\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s de niveau PE-03.\nElle conclut, pour les motifs suivants, qu\u2019aucune de ces all\u00e9gations n\u2019est appuy\u00e9e.\n[39] Quant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation, la preuve indique que l\u2019appelante ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux exigences requises ou n\u2019avait pas manifest\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les postes en question.\n[40] Quant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation, la preuve indique que l\u2019appelante n\u2019avait pas fait de demande de formation dans ses plans d\u2019apprentissage et que l\u2019ACDI n\u2019\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9e d\u2019offrir des formations qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas connexes aux fonctions de l\u2019employ\u00e9e.\n[41] Enfin, quant \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation, la preuve indique que l\u2019appelante et son autre coll\u00e8gue de niveau PE-03 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on dans le processus de s\u00e9lection aux fins de maintien au poste et de mise en disponibilit\u00e9 et n\u2019appuie pas l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[42] Le 16 juillet 2014, la Commission d\u00e9cide, \u00e0 la suite de son examen du Rapport et des observations transmises par l\u2019appelante et par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, de rejeter la Plainte au motif que, compte tenu des circonstances, l\u2019examen de la Plainte par le Tribunal n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9 (la D\u00e9cision).\nII. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sous appel [43] Le 15 ao\u00fbt 2014, l\u2019appelante demande le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la D\u00e9cision.\n[44] En premier lieu, elle soutient que la Commission, agissant conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la recommandation de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice, a commis une erreur de droit en refusant, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du Jugement sur l\u2019outrage du juge Boivin, de traiter de la question du non-respect du protocole.\n[45] Deuxi\u00e8mement, elle plaide que la Commission a rendu une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable en adoptant les motifs d\u2019un rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate r\u00e9sultant d\u2019une enqu\u00eate d\u00e9ficiente, illogique, incompl\u00e8te et \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des principes et valeurs de la Loi. Elle reproche \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019avoir refus\u00e9, sans explication, de consid\u00e9rer les circonstances de la plainte de 2003, y compris le non-respect du protocole, dans son \u00e9valuation de la Plainte. Elle soutient que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas enqu\u00eater sur une contravention all\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00e0 une entente approuv\u00e9e par la Commission mine l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de la Commission et le respect des droits de la personne au Canada. Elle pr\u00e9tend aussi que la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a err\u00e9 en omettant d\u2019\u00e9tudier l\u2019impact de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019ACDI, en contravention au protocole, de ne pas la nommer \u00e0 un poste PE-04 o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9e du r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement des effectifs men\u00e9 par son employeur.\n[46] Troisi\u00e8mement, elle soutient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de manquements \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Notamment, elle plaide que la Commission l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre ad\u00e9quatement aux erreurs commises par la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice en limitant ses observations \u00e0 la suite du Rapport \u00e0 un maximum de dix pages. De plus, elle pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019omission de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice de lui d\u00e9voiler qu\u2019elle ne traiterait pas des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole avant de transmettre le Rapport aux parties l\u2019a priv\u00e9e de l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser d\u2019autres documents et pi\u00e8ces justificatives pour appuyer et \u00e9clairer sa position.\nA. Norme de contr\u00f4le [47] Tout d\u2019abord, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale souscrit \u00e0 la position des parties que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas consid\u00e9rer les all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole donne lieu \u00e0 une question de droit qui doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte : Jugement au para. 47. Hormis cette question, elle examine le bien-fond\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission que l\u2019examen de la Plainte par le Tribunal n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9 en appliquant la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. Enfin, elle examine la question de manquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte.\nB. Refus de traiter de la question du non-respect du protocole [48] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale conclut que la Commission n\u2019a pas err\u00e9 en d\u00e9cidant, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la recommandation de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice, qu\u2019elle n\u2019examinerait pas les all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole dans le cadre de son traitement de la Plainte.\n[49] Comme l\u2019avait conclu le Rapport sur la recevabilit\u00e9, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale convient que le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage ne traite pas des questions des droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la Plainte : Jugement au para. 58. Le juge Boivin ne fait que constater l\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 du protocole et conclut que les faits ne lui permettent pas de d\u00e9duire que le d\u00e9roulement des n\u00e9gociations entre l\u2019appelante et l\u2019ACDI en vertu du protocole puisse \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 un outrage. La Cour observe que cela ne voulait pas dire pour autant que le Rapport sur la recevabilit\u00e9 recommandait \u00e0 la Commission de traiter toutes les all\u00e9gations de l\u2019appelante. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, la Cour estime d\u00e9terminant que :\n[\u2026 T]el que l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 le PGC, l\u2019assimilation du protocole d\u2019entente \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale limite la capacit\u00e9 de la Commission ou du Tribunal de statuer sur une all\u00e9gation de violation. Selon les paragraphes 15 et 16 du protocole d\u2019entente, les parties ont consenti \u00e0 ce que celui-ci soit assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de notre Cour, soit ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 de la sorte et que tout d\u00e9saccord concernant la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ses conditions fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019une m\u00e9diation permettant de ren\u00e9gocier les points en litige.\n[Jugement au para. 59.]\nC. Caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la D\u00e9cision [50] La Cour d\u00e9cide que le Rapport consid\u00e8re ad\u00e9quatement le contexte de la plainte de 2003 en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 une \u00ab plainte pr\u00e9alable \u00bb ou \u00e0 une \u00ab plainte ant\u00e9rieure \u00bb, en la mentionnant dans la chronologie des \u00e9v\u00e9nements reli\u00e9s \u00e0 la Plainte et en s\u2019en servant comme point de d\u00e9part de son analyse des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles avanc\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante. Puisque la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice n\u2019avait pas err\u00e9 en refusant de traiter des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole, la Cour rejette l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelante selon lequel l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice aurait d\u00fb aborder les cons\u00e9quences positives qui auraient pu r\u00e9sulter de sa nomination \u00e0 un poste PE-04 en vertu du paragraphe 6 du protocole.\nD. D\u00e9ni d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale [51] La Cour conclut qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de d\u00e9ni d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale dans le processus suivi par la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice et la Commission.\n[52] Se fondant sur Jean Pierre c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), 2015 CF 1423, [2015] A.C.F. no 1503 (Q.L.) au para. 51, et Donoghue c. Canada (Ministre de la D\u00e9fense nationale), 2010 CF 404, [2010] A.C.F. no 459 (Q.L.) au para. 28, elle d\u00e9cide que l\u2019exigence impos\u00e9e aux parties de soumettre des observations au sujet du Rapport ne d\u00e9passant pas dix pages est raisonnable et ne pose aucun probl\u00e8me v\u00e9ritable d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[53] La Cour d\u00e9cide que l\u2019omission de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice de d\u00e9voiler \u00e0 l\u2019appelante qu\u2019elle ne traiterait pas des all\u00e9gations concernant le non-respect du protocole ne constitue pas un manquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale puisque, en recevant le Rapport, l\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de la preuve consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice et a pu expliquer et pr\u00e9senter tous les arguments pertinents s\u2019y rapportant.\nIII. Les questions en litige et le r\u00f4le de la Cour dans cet appel [54] Ce pourvoi soul\u00e8ve trois questions. Premi\u00e8rement, y a-t-il eu un d\u00e9ni d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale dans le processus suivi par la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice et la Commission? Deuxi\u00e8mement, mis \u00e0 part sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est-elle d\u00e9raisonnable dans son traitement de la preuve plac\u00e9e devant elle? Troisi\u00e8mement, le refus de la Commission de traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole rend-il la D\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable?\n[55] Avant d\u2019examiner ces questions, il est n\u00e9cessaire de traiter du r\u00f4le de la Cour dans le pr\u00e9sent appel.\n[56] Notre Cour est tenue de d\u00e9cider si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a employ\u00e9 la norme de contr\u00f4le appropri\u00e9e et si elle l\u2019a appliqu\u00e9 correctement. De cette fa\u00e7on, en nous mettant \u00e0 la place de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, nous nous concentrons effectivement sur la d\u00e9cision administrative : Agraira c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2013 CSC 36, [2013] 2 R.C.S. 559 aux para. 45\u201347; Office r\u00e9gional de sant\u00e9 du Nord c. Horrocks, 2021 CSC 42, [2021] A.C.S. no 42 (Q.L.) aux para. 10\u201312.\n[57] En ce qui concerne les questions d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, la cour de r\u00e9vision doit trancher si la proc\u00e9dure suivie par le d\u00e9cideur administratif est \u00e9quitable eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des circonstances : Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique Limit\u00e9e c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CAF 69, [2019] 1 R.C.F. 121 au para. 54. En ce faisant, la cour de r\u00e9vision n\u2019applique aucune norme de contr\u00f4le : Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique au para. 54. La question fondamentale demeure celle de savoir si la partie vis\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision administrative connaissait la preuve \u00e0 r\u00e9futer et si elle a eu possibilit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te et \u00e9quitable d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre : Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique au para. 56; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Ennis, 2021 CAF 95, [2021] 4 R.C.F. 154 aux para. 44\u201345.\n[58] La norme d\u00e9f\u00e9rente de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable s\u2019applique au bien-fond\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer ou non au Tribunal une plainte relative aux droits de la personne, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte : Ennis au para. 46. Comme cette d\u00e9cision administrative n\u2019est pas susceptible d\u2019appel, cette norme s\u2019applique sauf dans des circonstances extraordinaires : Ennis au para. 46, citant Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les parties s\u2019entendent sur l\u2019application de la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable et n\u2019ont soulev\u00e9 aucune circonstance pouvant justifier une d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019application de cette norme.\n[59] Il s\u2019ensuit que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dont le jugement a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov, a err\u00e9 en appliquant la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission d\u2019exclure de l\u2019enqu\u00eate le traitement des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole au motif qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une question de droit : Jugement au para. 47. Pour les deux autres questions en litige, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a correctement identifi\u00e9 les normes de contr\u00f4le applicables.\n[60] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Tazehkand c. Banque du Canada, 2023 CAF 208, 2023 CarswellNat 5838 aux para. 28\u201340, notre Cour a r\u00e9cemment r\u00e9sum\u00e9 les principes juridiques qui encadrent le contr\u00f4le judiciaire des d\u00e9cisions de la Commission. Il en ressort les principes importants suivants :\na)La Commission n\u2019est pas un organisme d\u00e9cisionnel, une fonction remplie par le Tribunal. Son r\u00f4le est de \u00ab d\u00e9terminer si, aux termes des dispositions de la Loi et eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des faits, il est justifi\u00e9 de tenir une enqu\u00eate. L\u2019aspect principal de ce r\u00f4le est alors de v\u00e9rifier s\u2019il existe une preuve suffisante \u00bb : Cooper c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1996] 3 R.C.S. 854, 1996 CanLII 152 (C.S.C.) au para. 53; Tazehkand au para. 29.\nb)La Commission jouit d\u2019un vaste pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour d\u00e9cider, \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019examen d\u2019une plainte, qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate par le Tribunal est justifi\u00e9e compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 celle-ci. Les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives qui conf\u00e8rent cette discr\u00e9tion empruntent des termes non-limitatifs, et imposent ainsi des contraintes minimales \u00e0 la Commission dans l\u2019exercice de cette fonction : Tazehkand au para. 30; Halifax (Regional Municipality) c. Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Human Rights Commission), 2012 CSC 10, [2012] 1 R.C.S. 364 au para. 25; Ennis au para. 56.\nc)Dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate que m\u00e8ne la Commission afin de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il est justifi\u00e9 de constituer un Tribunal en vertu de l\u2019article 44 de la Loi, la Commission doit faire preuve de neutralit\u00e9 et de rigueur : Slattery c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1994] 2 C.F. 574, 1994 CanLII 3463 (C.F.) \u00e0 la p. 598, conf par 205 N.R. 383, 118 F.T.R. 318 (C.A.F.); Tazehkand au para. 33.\nd)Cependant, il faut faire preuve de retenue judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des organismes administratifs, dont la Commission, qui doivent \u00e9valuer la valeur probante de la preuve et d\u00e9cider de poursuivre ou non les enqu\u00eates : Slattery \u00e0 la p. 600; Tazehkand au para. 34.\ne)La cour de r\u00e9vision doit reconna\u00eetre que la Commission est ma\u00eetre de son processus et lui laisser beaucoup de latitude dans la fa\u00e7on dont elle m\u00e8ne ses enqu\u00eates : Tahmourpour c. Canada (Solliciteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 113, 332 N.R. 60 au para. 39; Tazehkand aux para. 35\u201336.\nf)En \u00e9valuant si la Commission fait preuve de rigueur dans son enqu\u00eate, il ne faut pas astreindre cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 une norme de perfection. Vu ses ressources limit\u00e9es et son volume de travail \u00e9lev\u00e9, la Commission doit chercher un \u00e9quilibre entre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des plaignants d\u2019avoir droit \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate la plus compl\u00e8te possible, et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour la Commission de r\u00e9pondre aux exigences de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 administrative: Slattery \u00e0 la p. 600; Tahmourpour au para. 39; Tazehkand aux para. 36\u201337.\ng)Les parties peuvent compenser les omissions moins graves dans le rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur en les portant \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la Commission dans leurs observations compl\u00e9mentaires. Les seules lacunes dont serait entach\u00e9 le rapport d\u2019un enqu\u00eateur qui n\u00e9cessiteront une intervention du tribunal sont celles qui sont \u00e0 ce point fondamentales qu\u2019il ne pourra y \u00eatre rem\u00e9di\u00e9 par les observations compl\u00e9mentaires pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les parties \u00e0 la Commission : Sketchley c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 404, [2006] 3 R.C.F. 392 au para. 38; Slattery aux pp. 600\u2013601; Tazehkand au para. 38.\nh)Lorsque la Commission ent\u00e9rine les recommandations d\u2019un enqu\u00eateur et motive sa d\u00e9cision de mani\u00e8re sommaire, la Cour de r\u00e9vision pr\u00e9sume que les motifs de la Commission sont ceux expos\u00e9s dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Les motifs de la Commission peuvent donc \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9s en se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate : Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de production du Qu\u00e9bec et de l\u2019Acadie c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1989] 2 R.C.S. 879, 1989 CanLII 44 (C.S.C.) \u00e0 la p. 903, au para. 35; Bell Canada c. Syndicat canadien des communications, de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et du papier, [1999] 1 C.F. 113, [1998] A.C.F. no 1609 (Q.L.) au para. 30; Tazehkand au para. 39.\ni)Si la Commission fonde sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas constituer un Tribunal en vertu de l\u2019article 44 sur une enqu\u00eate d\u00e9ficiente, cette d\u00e9cision sera d\u00e9raisonnable puisque la Commission ne disposait pas des renseignements pertinents n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire : Sketchley au para. 112; Grover c. Canada (Conseil national de recherches), 2001 CFPI 687, 206 F.T.R. 207 au para. 70; Tazehkand au para. 40.\n[61] En gardant ces principes \u00e0 l\u2019esprit, je vais examiner chacune des trois questions en litige.\nIV. Analyse A. Y a-t-il eu un d\u00e9ni d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale? [62] L\u2019appelante soutient que dans sa D\u00e9cision sur la recevabilit\u00e9, la Commission a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019objection de l\u2019ACDI que la Plainte \u00e9tait vexatoire \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du Jugement sur l\u2019outrage du juge Boivin. Elle estime donc qu\u2019elle avait, compte tenu de la D\u00e9cision sur la recevabilit\u00e9, une attente l\u00e9gitime que la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice tiendrait compte de la contravention all\u00e9gu\u00e9e du protocole. En refusant de la consid\u00e9rer, la Commission se serait \u00ab contredite \u00bb, aurait \u00ab ressuscit\u00e9 \u00bb l\u2019objection de l\u2019ACDI dans le Rapport et aurait port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019attente l\u00e9gitime de l\u2019appelante.\n[63] L\u2019appelante soumet que si la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice lui avait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne tiendrait pas compte de la contravention all\u00e9gu\u00e9e du protocole, elle aurait d\u00e9pos\u00e9, dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, des documents additionnels pour appuyer et \u00e9tayer sa position, notamment la plainte de 2003, la recommandation de la Commission concernant la plainte de 2003 et les rapports d\u2019\u00e9valuation concernant la formation de l\u2019appelante \u00e0 la CFP en 2006\u20132007. C\u2019est dans ce contexte que l\u2019appelante maintient qu\u2019il est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale de limiter sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 un maximum de 10 pages.\n[64] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soumet que les exigences de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9es puisque l\u2019appelante connaissait la preuve \u00e0 r\u00e9futer et a eu une possibilit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te et \u00e9quitable d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre. L\u2019appelante a re\u00e7u le Rapport avant qu\u2019il ne soit envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission et a donc appris que l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice ne traitait pas des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole. Dans leurs repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites, les procureurs de l\u2019appelante ont contest\u00e9 cette conclusion de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice, expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi ces all\u00e9gations devraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es et joint une copie du protocole. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, la limite de 10 pages impos\u00e9es aux parties pour r\u00e9pondre au Rapport n\u2019enfreignait pas l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[65] \u00c0 mon avis, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas err\u00e9 en concluant que l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il y a eu un d\u00e9ni d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale dans le processus emprunt\u00e9 par la Commission pour en arriver \u00e0 la D\u00e9cision.\n[66] L\u2019appelante a re\u00e7u le Rapport avant que la Commission ne l\u2019examine et prenne sa d\u00e9cision. Elle a, de ce fait, pris connaissance de la preuve \u00e0 r\u00e9futer, y compris la d\u00e9cision de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice de ne pas traiter les all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole. Elle a eu la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019y r\u00e9pliquer et a d\u2019ailleurs soumis des repr\u00e9sentations en r\u00e9ponse au Rapport qui faisaient \u00e9tat de sa position sur la question.\n[67] L\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9, dans le dossier devant la Cour, une affirmation claire, nette et explicite qui aurait suscit\u00e9 chez elle une attente l\u00e9gitime concernant la tenue de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Plainte : Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Mavi, 2011 CSC 30, [2011] 2 R.C.S. 534 au para. 68. Comme l\u2019a constat\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au paragraphe 55 du Jugement, ni la D\u00e9cision sur la recevabilit\u00e9 ni le Rapport sur la recevabilit\u00e9 ont affirm\u00e9 que la Commission devait se prononcer sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du protocole. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, l\u2019appelante a eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter des repr\u00e9sentations en r\u00e9ponse au Rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Ses droits proc\u00e9duraux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9s.\n[68] L\u2019argument de l\u2019appelante selon laquelle elle aurait d\u00e9pos\u00e9, dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, des documents additionnels si la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice lui avait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne consid\u00e9rerait pas les all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole ne tient pas la route. Si, comme le pr\u00e9tend l\u2019appelante, certains documents \u00e9taient pertinents et indispensables pour comprendre et mettre en contexte les all\u00e9gations de discrimination expos\u00e9es dans la Plainte, rien ne l\u2019emp\u00eachait de les d\u00e9poser aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but - que l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice d\u00e9cide ou non de se pencher sur les all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole.\n[69] Enfin, comme cette Cour l\u2019a confirm\u00e9 dans Phipps c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Canadienne des Postes, 2016 CAF 117, 484 N.R. 7 au para. 8, confirmant 2015 CF 1080, [2015] A.C.F. no 1079 (Q.L.) au para. 40, l\u2019imposition aux parties par la Commission d\u2019une longueur maximale de 10 pages pour leurs repr\u00e9sentations en r\u00e9ponse au Rapport ne constitue pas en soi un d\u00e9ni d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale \u00e0 condition que cette restriction soit appliqu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re uniforme aux parties. L\u2019appelante ne m\u2019a pas convaincu que ce principe ne saurait trouver application en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nB. Mise \u00e0 part la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole, sa d\u00e9cision est-elle d\u00e9raisonnable dans son traitement de la preuve plac\u00e9e devant elle ? [70] L\u2019appelante soumet que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission manque de transparence et d\u2019intelligibilit\u00e9 dans son traitement des preuves relatives \u00e0 la plainte de 2003 en omettant sans raison toute r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus entre 2009 et 2012 et soutient que ces erreurs, qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, d\u00e9montrent le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable de la d\u00e9cision.\n[71] L\u2019appelante souligne notamment les erreurs suivantes :\na)Le Rapport ne consid\u00e8re pas les all\u00e9gations de la plainte de 2003 en tant que circonstances factuelles pertinentes \u00e0 la Plainte et ignore compl\u00e8tement les \u00e9v\u00e9nements entre f\u00e9vrier 2009 et janvier 2012 dont l\u2019\u00e9tude serait n\u00e9cessaire pour comprendre le lien all\u00e9gu\u00e9 entre ces deux plaintes.\nb)La deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice n\u2019a pas pris en compte les all\u00e9gations de la plainte de 2003 afin de bien comprendre le contexte de la Plainte. Ces plaintes sont intimement li\u00e9es dans les faits et les all\u00e9gations de la plainte de 2003 indiquent que l\u2019ACDI n\u2019a jamais cess\u00e9 de traiter l\u2019appelante de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en doutant de ses comp\u00e9tences et en lui refusant toute promotion alors qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait ses preuves.\nc)Plut\u00f4t que d\u2019examiner l\u2019impact diff\u00e9rentiel et discriminatoire sur l\u2019appelante, dans le cadre du r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement des effectifs, du refus de l\u2019ACDI de la nommer \u00e0 un poste PE-04 en contravention du protocole, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a examin\u00e9 si l\u2019appelante et ses coll\u00e8gues de niveau PE-03 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, une analyse illogique qui ne r\u00e9pond pas aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles soulev\u00e9es dans la Plainte.\n[72] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice n\u2019a pas ignor\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations et le contexte de la plainte de 2003 puisqu\u2019elle la mentionne dans la \u00ab Chronologie des \u00e9v\u00e9nements de cette plainte \u00bb au paragraphe 10 du Rapport et qu\u2019elle en fait le point de d\u00e9part de son analyse des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles aux paragraphes 58 \u00e0 61 du Rapport.\n[73] Le contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable s\u2019int\u00e9resse avant tout aux motifs de la d\u00e9cision : Vavilov au para. 84. Une cour de r\u00e9vision \u00ab doit d\u2019abord examiner les motifs donn\u00e9s avec \u201cune attention respectueuse\u201d, et chercher \u00e0 comprendre le fil du raisonnement suivi par le d\u00e9cideur pour en arriver \u00e0 sa conclusion \u00bb : Vavilov au para. 84. Une d\u00e9cision raisonnable est \u00e0 la fois fond\u00e9e sur un raisonnement intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rent et justifi\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des contraintes juridiques et factuelles qui ont une incidence sur la d\u00e9cision : Vavilov au para. 99. Il incombe donc \u00e0 l\u2019appelante de convaincre cette Cour que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission et le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur lequel elle se fonde sont entach\u00e9s d\u2019une lacune suffisamment capitale pour les rendre d\u00e9raisonnables : Vavilov au para. 100.\n[74] Dans le Rapport, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a trait\u00e9 de trois revendications importantes qu\u2019avan\u00e7ait l\u2019appelante dans la Plainte : que l\u2019ACDI aurait syst\u00e9matiquement refus\u00e9 de promouvoir l\u2019appelante, qu\u2019elle lui aurait refus\u00e9 des possibilit\u00e9s de formation et qu\u2019elle aurait pris, envers l\u2019appelante, des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles li\u00e9es au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte de 2003.\n[75] Je suis d\u2019avis que la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a suivi un raisonnement rationnel et logique dans son analyse de ces arguments et de la preuve qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et qu\u2019\u00e0 ce chapitre, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission n\u2019est pas d\u00e9raisonnable.\n(1) Dans son traitement de la preuve, le Rapport suit un raisonnement intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rent et se justifie au regard des contraintes juridiques et factuelles pertinentes [76] Dans la Plainte, l\u2019appelante affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un refus syst\u00e9matique de promotion, malgr\u00e9 ses expressions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat et ses d\u00e9p\u00f4ts de candidatures pour des concours. Elle affirme que son \u00e9limination \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection dans un processus de nomination PE-05 \u00e9tait discriminatoire, puisqu\u2019elle ex\u00e9cutait \u00e0 la CFP des t\u00e2ches d\u2019analyste au niveau PE-05 et avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une performance satisfaisante.\n[77] Dans le cadre de son enqu\u00eate sur les pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019appelante relatives \u00e0 l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir un emploi, une promotion, une affectation int\u00e9rimaire ou autre occasion d\u2019emploi, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice fait \u00e9tat de trois occasions d\u2019emplois qui se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en 2011 et les examine en profondeur.\n[78] Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019appelante a postul\u00e9 pour le poste de Conseiller principal en mati\u00e8re de politique de ressources humaines (PE-05). Cependant, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a conclu, apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9vis\u00e9 les qualifications essentielles pour ce poste, que l\u2019appelante ne rencontrait pas la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019\u00ab [e]xp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente et vaste de la prestation de conseils en mati\u00e8re de dotation ou de classification \u00e0 la haute direction \u00bb qui \u00e9tait une qualification essentielle \u00e0 ce poste.\n[79] Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019appelante a exprim\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour participer \u00e0 un projet sp\u00e9cial \u00e0 l\u2019interne au niveau PE-04 qui consistait \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper une strat\u00e9gie de recrutement. L\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a conclu que ce projet a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 quand l\u2019ACDI a d\u00fb se pr\u00e9parer pour un r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement des effectifs et que personne n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi pour participer au projet sp\u00e9cial.\n[80] Troisi\u00e8mement, bien que l\u2019appelante ait exprim\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat verbalement pour un poste int\u00e9rimaire au niveau PE-04, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a conclu qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu des informations suppl\u00e9mentaires sur les connaissances requises, l\u2019appelante a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux exigences et n\u2019a pas manifest\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le poste par \u00e9crit.\n[81] Je suis d\u2019avis que la conclusion de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice rejetant l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle l\u2019ACDI aurait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en refusant \u00e0 l\u2019appelante toute possibilit\u00e9 de promotion ou d\u2019affectation aux postes en question est fond\u00e9e sur un raisonnement intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rent qui est \u00e0 la fois rationnel et logique et tient compte de la preuve devant elle.\n[82] De m\u00eame, la conclusion de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice quant \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de l\u2019appelante qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de traitement diff\u00e9rentiel n\u00e9gatif dans le cadre de son emploi parce que, malgr\u00e9 ses demandes verbales, l\u2019ACDI ne lui a pas offert de possibilit\u00e9s de formation en dotation, est fond\u00e9e sur un raisonnement intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rent qui est \u00e0 la fois rationnel et logique et tient compte de la preuve devant elle.\n[83] L\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a not\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante a reconnu ne pas avoir fait de demande \u00e9crite pour de la formation en dotation dans ses plans d\u2019apprentissage et que les obligations de l\u2019employeur se limitaient \u00e0 offrir aux employ\u00e9s des formations connexes \u00e0 leurs fonctions. Ainsi, la preuve n\u2019appuyait pas l\u2019all\u00e9gation de l\u2019appelante qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel n\u00e9gatif. Devant cette Cour, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 en quoi cette d\u00e9termination de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable.\n[84] Enfin, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a conclu que l\u2019appelante n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le r\u00e9sultat du processus de s\u00e9lection aux fins de maintien en poste et de mise en disponibilit\u00e9 constituait une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles envers l\u2019appelante parce qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte de 2003. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que, bien que certains membres du comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation \u00e9taient au courant que la plaignante avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte, les examens administr\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appelante et \u00e0 une autre candidate ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus anonymes avant d\u2019\u00eatre corrig\u00e9s et, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019autre candidate, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas obtenu la note de passage pour toutes les qualifications essentielles. Cette conclusion de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice est aussi d\u00e9fendable compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve devant elle.\n[85] Dans ses repr\u00e9sentations \u00e0 la Commission sur le Rapport, l\u2019appelante soutient que l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a mal compris la Plainte en rattachant le r\u00e9sultat de ce processus \u00e0 ses all\u00e9gations sur les repr\u00e9sailles et que le Rapport est illogique et ne r\u00e9pond pas aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles soulev\u00e9es dans la Plainte.\n[86] Cependant, l\u2019appelante ne fait aucune mention dans la Plainte ou dans ses repr\u00e9sentations d\u2019actes pr\u00e9cis qui constitueraient des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte de 2003. En l\u2019absence d\u2019explications \u00e9tayant son all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles, il \u00e9tait loisible \u00e0 la Commission de conclure que l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles n\u2019\u00e9tait pas appuy\u00e9e.\n(2) L\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de lacunes fondamentales dans le traitement par la Commission et l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de la preuve devant elles [87] L\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019en ne prenant pas en compte les all\u00e9gations de la plainte de 2003 dans son analyse de la Plainte, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a agi de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable. Elle souligne que les all\u00e9gations qu\u2019elle a formul\u00e9es dans la plainte de 2003 portaient sur des comportements semblables \u00e0 celles qu\u2019elle a faites dans la Plainte.\n[88] Il appert du Rapport que l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice \u00e9tait bien au fait de ces pr\u00e9tentions. Aux paragraphes 2 et 6, apr\u00e8s sa description des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui entourent la plainte de 2003, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice \u00e9crit que l\u2019appelante \u00ab all\u00e8gue que le mis en cause continue de refuser d\u2019accueillir ses comp\u00e9tences [\u2026] et qu\u2019elle a maintenant supprim\u00e9 le poste de la plaignante, ce qui n\u2019aurait pas eu lieu si le mis en cause n\u2019avait pas refus\u00e9 d\u2019accepter ses comp\u00e9tences \u00bb [je souligne].\n[89] Comme l\u2019observait la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au paragraphe 61 du Jugement, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice dresse une chronologie des \u00e9v\u00e9nements de la Plainte et inclut au tout d\u00e9but de la chronologie la plainte de 2003.\n[90] Le Rapport, au paragraphe 44, refl\u00e8te fid\u00e8lement l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelante que \u00ab compte tenu des discussions concernant la plainte pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, le mis en cause n\u2019a pas offert des occasions \u00e0 la plaignante pour approfondir ses connaissances en dotation, au niveau op\u00e9rationnel \u00bb [je souligne]. L\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a not\u00e9 que d\u00e8s son retour \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI en 2009, l\u2019appelante a re\u00e7u des formations, bien qu\u2019elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en dotation, mais n\u2019a jamais fait de demande \u00e9crite dans ses plans d\u2019apprentissage pour les ann\u00e9es fiscales 2009\u20132010, 2010\u20132011 et 2011\u20132012.\n[91] De m\u00eame, au paragraphe 62 du Rapport, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice refl\u00e8te fid\u00e8lement l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelante en repla\u00e7ant son all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles dans le contexte des discussions entre l\u2019appelante et l\u2019ACDI concernant leur dispute au sujet de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du protocole.\n[92] Contrairement aux pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019appelante, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a bien saisi son argument que le comportement de l\u2019ACDI envers l\u2019appelante apr\u00e8s son retour en 2009 \u00e9tait une continuation du comportement qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la plainte de 2003.\n[93] D\u2019ailleurs, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 dans la discussion des arguments centr\u00e9s sur le d\u00e9ni all\u00e9gu\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, si l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que des comportements sp\u00e9cifiques de l\u2019ACDI qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la plainte de 2003 \u00e9taient d\u2019une importance cruciale pour comprendre la Plainte ou la mettre en contexte, rien ne l\u2019emp\u00eachait de fournir ce rapport et tout autre document pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice pour qu\u2019elle les examine avec \u00ab toute la documentation fournie par les parties en plus de la plainte, de la position du mis en cause et de la r\u00e9futation de la plaignante. \u00bb\nC. Le refus de traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole rend-t-elle la D\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable? [94] L\u2019appelante plaide que la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a commis une erreur en fait et en droit lorsqu\u2019elle a refus\u00e9 de traiter des all\u00e9gations dans la Plainte concernant la contravention du protocole. Rappelons qu\u2019ayant soulign\u00e9 la conclusion du juge Boivin, dans le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage, que les faits ne lui permettaient pas de d\u00e9duire que le d\u00e9roulement des n\u00e9gociations entre l\u2019appelante et l\u2019ACDI en vertu du protocole puisse \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 un outrage, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a conclu au paragraphe 8 de son Rapport que la Commission ne traiterait pas des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole puisqu\u2019elles \u00ab ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par un autre processus \u00bb.\n[95] Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019en ent\u00e9rinant la recommandation de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole, la Commission a agi de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable.\n[96] Pour qu\u2019une cour de r\u00e9vision la d\u00e9clare raisonnable, il ne suffit pas qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit justifiable; le d\u00e9cideur doit, au moyen de ses motifs, justifier sa d\u00e9cision aupr\u00e8s des personnes auxquelles elle s\u2019applique.\n[97] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2021 CAF 157, [2022] 1 R.C.F. 153, notre Cour s\u2019est longuement pench\u00e9e sur l\u2019obligation d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif, \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov, de fournir aux personnes auxquelles s\u2019applique sa d\u00e9cision une explication motiv\u00e9e et suffisante pour appuyer cette d\u00e9cision.\n[98] Une explication motiv\u00e9e comprend deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments. Premi\u00e8rement, elle doit \u00eatre ad\u00e9quate, en permettant \u00e0 une cour de r\u00e9vision de discerner une analyse coh\u00e9rente et raisonnable qu\u2019elle est en mesure de suivre et de comprendre. Le d\u00e9cideur administratif ne satisfait pas \u00e0 cette exigence lorsque son raisonnement comprend des lacunes fondamentales parce que les motifs ne font pas \u00e9tat d\u2019une analyse rationnelle, ou lorsqu\u2019il est impossible de comprendre son raisonnement sur un point central de sorte qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun v\u00e9ritable raisonnement : Alexion au para. 12, citant Vavilov aux para. 85\u201386, 102\u201304. Deuxi\u00e8mement, ce raisonnement doit \u00eatre rationnel et logique et d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de faille d\u00e9cisive dans la logique globale. Le raisonnement d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif ne satisfait pas \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re si ses motifs ne font pas \u00e9tat d\u2019une analyse rationnelle, poss\u00e8dent un fondement erron\u00e9, r\u00e9v\u00e8lent une analyse d\u00e9raisonnable ou irrationnelle ou comprennent des erreurs manifestes sur le plan rationnel, dont le recours du d\u00e9cideur \u00e0 un raisonnement tautologique, de faux dilemmes, des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations non fond\u00e9es ou une pr\u00e9misse absurde : Alexion au para. 12, citant Vavilov aux para. 96, 103\u201304.\n[99] Afin de m\u00e9riter l\u2019intervention d\u2019une cour de r\u00e9vision, une lacune ne peut \u00eatre superficielle ou accessoire par rapport au fond de la d\u00e9cision; elle doit \u00eatre manifeste et concerner un point central reposant, entre autres, sur les questions et pr\u00e9occupations centrales soulev\u00e9es par les parties : Alexion au para. 13, citant Vavilov aux para. 102\u201303, 127\u201328.\n[100] Comme la Cour supr\u00eame dans Vavilov, notre Cour met en garde les cours de r\u00e9vision contre la tentation d\u2019examiner les motifs des d\u00e9cideurs administratifs au regard d\u2019une norme de perfection et d\u2019assujettir ces d\u00e9cideurs aux \u00ab normes auxquelles sont astreints des logiciens \u00e9rudits \u00bb : Alexion au para. 23, citant Vavilov aux para. 91, 104. S\u2019attendre que les d\u00e9cideurs administratifs livrent une justice administrative qui ressemble toujours \u00e0 la justice judiciaire risquerait de \u00ab judiciariser de fa\u00e7on excessive les processus administratifs, ce qui menacerait leur efficacit\u00e9 et risquerait de compromettre les motifs pr\u00e9cis pour lesquels le l\u00e9gislateur a confi\u00e9 cette comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l\u2019administration, \u00e0 l\u2019origine \u00bb : Alexion au para. 24.\n[101] La Cour supr\u00eame pr\u00e9vient que le fait qu\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif ne mentionne pas explicitement quelque chose dans ses motifs ne m\u00e8ne pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019ils sont insuffisants et que sa d\u00e9cision est d\u00e9raisonnable. Une cour de r\u00e9vision doit lire ses motifs de fa\u00e7on globale et contextuelle, eu \u00e9gard au dossier et en tenant d\u00fbment compte du r\u00e9gime administratif dans lequel ils sont donn\u00e9s : Alexion au para. 15, citant Vavilov aux para. 97, 103. Donc, le silence dans les motifs explicites sur un point pr\u00e9cis ne constitue pas n\u00e9cessairement une \u00ab lacune fondamentale \u00bb justifiant l\u2019intervention de la cour de r\u00e9vision :\nLes motifs du d\u00e9cideur administratif, lus s\u00e9par\u00e9ment ou au regard du dossier de fa\u00e7on globale et sensible, peuvent conduire l\u00e9gitimement la cour de r\u00e9vision \u00e0 conclure que le d\u00e9cideur administratif a tir\u00e9 une conclusion implicite. Le dossier de la preuve, les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, les points compris par le d\u00e9cideur administratif compte tenu des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents auxquels il renvoie ou qu\u2019il doit conna\u00eetre, la nature de la question que le d\u00e9cideur administratif doit trancher et les autres affaires connues du d\u00e9cideur administratif peuvent \u00e9galement alimenter le fondement permettant \u00e0 la cour de r\u00e9vision de conclure que le d\u00e9cideur administratif a tir\u00e9 des conclusions implicites.\n[Alexion au para. 16; citations omises.]\n[102] Je suis d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la recommandation de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice, de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole, repose sur des questions et pr\u00e9occupations centrales soulev\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante et concerne donc un point central de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission qu\u2019un examen par le Tribunal de la Plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9, compte tenu des circonstances.\n[103] D\u2019une part, dans la Plainte, l\u2019appelante d\u00e9crit la contravention all\u00e9gu\u00e9e du protocole par l\u2019ACDI comme la premi\u00e8re instance d\u2019une continuation, par son employeur, d\u2019un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel \u00e0 son endroit suite \u00e0 son retour \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI en 2009. Selon l\u2019appelante, n\u2019eut \u00e9t\u00e9 de la contravention du protocole, l\u2019ACDI l\u2019aurait nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de niveau PE-04, o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019abri de l\u2019\u00e9limination de son poste lors du r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement des effectifs.\n[104] D\u2019autre part, dans sa r\u00e9ponse au Rapport de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice, \u00e0 laquelle elle joint une copie du protocole, l\u2019appelante met au premier plan son argument que la recommandation de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de ne pas traiter de la contravention all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de l\u2019article 6 du protocole est en contradiction avec la D\u00e9cision sur la recevabilit\u00e9 et, de ce fait, entach\u00e9e d\u2019une erreur fondamentale. C\u2019est donc \u00e0 juste titre que la juge Saint-Louis, au paragraphe 50 du Jugement, affirme que cette recommandation est \u00ab au c\u0153ur \u00bb du litige entre les parties.\n[105] \u00c0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole comprend des lacunes fondamentales qui concernent ce point central. Le d\u00e9faut dont souffre cette d\u00e9cision n\u2019est pas qu\u2019il est impossible de comprendre le raisonnement de la Commission, qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun v\u00e9ritable raisonnement, ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas tir\u00e9 de conclusions explicites dans ses motifs; il ne rel\u00e8ve donc pas du caract\u00e8re ad\u00e9quat de l\u2019explication motiv\u00e9e. Son d\u00e9faut est plut\u00f4t que les motifs explicites de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice, qu\u2019ent\u00e9rine la Commission, reposent sur un fondement erron\u00e9, privant son raisonnement de la logique, la coh\u00e9rence et la rationalit\u00e9 qui caract\u00e9risent une d\u00e9cision raisonnable.\n[106] L\u2019examen du caract\u00e8re raisonnable d\u2019une d\u00e9cision administrative s\u2019int\u00e9resse avant tout aux motifs de la d\u00e9cision : Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes c.

Barrette, [2000] 4 CF 145, [2000] A.C.F. no 539 (Q.L.), elle a conclu que :\n[\u2026L]a Commission ne peut entendre une plainte ayant fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive dans le cadre d\u2019un autre processus que si (a) la plainte formul\u00e9e devant la Commission comporte des questions relatives aux droits de la personne qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es par l\u2019autre d\u00e9cideur, ou (b) le plaignant n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019occasion de soumettre ses questions relatives aux droits de la personne dans le cadre de l\u2019autre processus.\n[Je souligne.]\n[108] L\u2019ACDI a fait valoir \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice que la Commission ne devrait pas statuer sur la Plainte parce que les all\u00e9gations dont elle faisait part portaient essentiellement sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans sa requ\u00eate en outrage et invitaient la Commission \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter \u00e0 nouveau le paragraphe 6 du protocole.\n[109] La premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice n\u2019a pas accueilli cet argument et a conclu que la Plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vexatoire et de ce fait irrecevable. Il est utile de reproduire l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de son analyse :\n20. La question devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9tait \u00e0 savoir si la mise en cause avait commis un outrage \u00e0 la Cour en ne respectant pas son ordonnance donnant force au protocole d\u2019entente intervenu entre les parties en 2005. Or, la Cour a conclu qu\u2019il y avait (sic) \u00ab qu\u2019une diff\u00e9rence dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e et la conduite des parties n\u2019est donc pas clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 (sic) \u00bb (Mache Rameau c. Canada (Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 1286 au para 19). La Cour a aussi tenu compte des d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la Cour ne doit pas conclure \u00e0 un outrage quand l\u2019ordonnance en question est ambigu\u00eb, et la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\n21. Or, cette plainte inclut des all\u00e9gations additionnelles, notamment, l\u2019all\u00e9gation que la suppression de son poste constitue des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles.\n22. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019appel (sic) a confirm\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment que la Commission ne doit pas rejeter une plainte sous l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41 que dans les cas \u00e9vidents (voir Keith c Service correctionnel du Canada, 2012 CAF 117 au para 50). Ceci n\u2019est pas un cas \u00e9vident. Bien que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a (sic) rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de la plaignante, les questions des droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la plainte n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour et il y a des all\u00e9gations dans la plainte qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour non plus. De plus, la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise dans le contexte d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure d\u2019outrage, ce qui soul\u00e8ve des consid\u00e9rations diff\u00e9rentes et un fardeau de preuve distinct d\u2019une plainte \u00e0 la Commission.\nConclusion\n23. Cette plainte contient des all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte n\u2019est pas vexatoire au sens de l\u2019article 41.\n[Je souligne.]\n[110] Force est de constater que, selon la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice, la Plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vexatoire parce que les questions de droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la Plainte \u00ab n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour \u00bb et, selon la jurisprudence suivie par l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice, n\u2019avaient donc pas \u00ab \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es par l\u2019autre d\u00e9cideur \u00bb. Suivant cette recommandation, la Commission a conclu dans sa D\u00e9cision sur la recevabilit\u00e9 que la Plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vexatoire au sens de l\u2019article 41 parce qu\u2019elle contenait des \u00ab all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb.\n[111] Rappelons que dans la Plainte, l\u2019appelante all\u00e8gue que la pr\u00e9tendue contravention du protocole constitue la premi\u00e8re instance de traitement diff\u00e9rentiel envers elle de la part de son employeur apr\u00e8s son retour \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI en f\u00e9vrier 2009. Cette question est donc l\u2019une des \u00ab questions des droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la Plainte \u00bb qui, selon la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage. Comme le remarque cette enqu\u00eatrice, dans le contexte de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019outrage, la question devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale se limitait \u00e0 savoir si les obligations des parties \u00e9taient clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le protocole. Le juge Boivin n\u2019a pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 s\u2019il y a eu contravention du protocole ou si cette contravention \u00e9tait un acte discriminatoire. Il lui suffisait de d\u00e9cider que les dispositions du protocole \u00e9taient ambigu\u00ebs pour disposer de la requ\u00eate devant la Cour. Aux paragraphes 4 et 41 du Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal, d\u00e9cid\u00e9 deux ans plus tard, le juge Roy en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion.\n[112] Qu\u2019en est-il du Rapport de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice? Apr\u00e8s avoir constat\u00e9 que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les faits devant elle ne lui permettaient pas de d\u00e9duire que le d\u00e9roulement des n\u00e9gociations entre l\u2019appelante et l\u2019ACDI en vertu du paragraphe 16 du protocole puisse \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 un outrage, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a conclu, au para. 8 :\nDe ce fait, les all\u00e9gations concernant la contravention du protocole d\u2019entente ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par un autre processus et la Commission ne traitera pas de ces all\u00e9gations. Cependant, quant aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles de discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, le 19 juin 2013, de statuer sur la plainte en vertu du paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne parce que la plainte contient des all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[Je souligne.]\n[113] Le fondement de la d\u00e9cision de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations concernant le non-respect du protocole, qu\u2019elles avaient \u00ab \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es \u00bb par le juge Boivin dans le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage, est erron\u00e9. Comme l\u2019a fait valoir la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice, la port\u00e9e du Jugement sur l\u2019outrage est limit\u00e9e. Afin d\u2019obtenir gain de cause dans sa requ\u00eate pour une ordonnance de justification, l\u2019appelante devait fournir \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une preuve prima facie de l\u2019outrage reproch\u00e9, y compris la preuve d\u2019une violation d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l\u2019ordonnance du juge Pinard qui homologuait le protocole. Une violation d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ne pouvait \u00eatre \u00e9tablie que si l\u2019ordonnance \u00e9nonce des obligations claires. Le juge Boivin a constat\u00e9 que le paragraphe 6 du protocole \u00e9tait ambigu, ce qui lui a suffi pour conclure que la requ\u00eate devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Il n\u2019a pas r\u00e9solu l\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 : Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal aux para. 4, 41.\n[114] Il s\u2019ensuit que la conclusion de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice que les all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole \u00ab avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par un autre processus \u00bb ne peut prendre sa source dans l\u2019analyse de la port\u00e9e du Jugement sur l\u2019outrage qu\u2019effectue l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice dans le Rapport.\n[115] Puisque la Commission a ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 les recommandations de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice et motiv\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision de mani\u00e8re sommaire, je dois pr\u00e9sumer que ses motifs sont ceux expos\u00e9s dans le Rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate et conclure qu\u2019ils souffrent de la m\u00eame lacune. La d\u00e9cision de la Commission d\u2019exclure de son traitement de la plainte les all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole ne saurait \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e par le fait que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait trait\u00e9 de ces all\u00e9gations dans son Jugement sur l\u2019outrage, vu la port\u00e9e limit\u00e9e de ce jugement.\n[116] La conclusion de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice dans le Rapport que le juge Boivin a trait\u00e9 de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de contravention du protocole est incompatible avec la conclusion de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice, dans le Rapport sur la recevabilit\u00e9, que les questions des droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la Plainte n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et que les consid\u00e9rations soulev\u00e9es devant la Cour dans la requ\u00eate en outrage \u00e9taient diff\u00e9rentes de celles soulev\u00e9es par la Plainte \u00e0 la Commission. Ni la Commission ni la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice n\u2019ont fourni une explication permettant de concilier ces d\u00e9cisions apparemment contradictoires. La d\u00e9cision de la Commission sur ce point est d\u00e9pourvue d\u2019une analyse intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rente et rationnelle.\n[117] Mes coll\u00e8gues estiment que, dans son rapport, la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice dresse une distinction entre les questions de droits de la personne relevant du non-respect du protocole, qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et ne devraient donc pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es par la Commission, et les autres questions de droits de la personne qui devraient faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate. Il n\u2019y aurait donc pas de contradiction entre les conclusions de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice et celles de la deuxi\u00e8me.\n[118] \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019analyse de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice ne se pr\u00eate pas \u00e0 cette interpr\u00e9tation. Dans la derni\u00e8re phrase du paragraphe 22 du Rapport sur la recevabilit\u00e9, \u00e0 la toute fin de son analyse et suivant sa conclusion que les questions de droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la Plainte n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour, la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice prend la peine d\u2019expliquer que le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage, qui portait sur les questions de non-respect du protocole, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans le contexte d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure soulevant des consid\u00e9rations diff\u00e9rentes et un fardeau de preuve distinct d\u2019une plainte \u00e0 la Commission. Cette explication n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire si l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que les questions de non-respect du protocole avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour et ne devaient pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es par la Commission; elle fait plut\u00f4t \u00e9tat de la conclusion de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019issue de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019outrage, la Commission demeure libre d\u2019examiner les questions de non-respect du protocole, en appliquant le fardeau de preuve appropri\u00e9, dans le contexte de son mandat l\u00e9gislatif visant \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les Canadiens contre la discrimination.\n[119] Au paragraphe 58 du Jugement, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a reconnu que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole ne trouvait aucun fondement dans le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage :\nLa Cour convient que le juge Boivin n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 des questions des droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es dans la Plainte. Il a soulev\u00e9 l\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 du protocole d\u2019entente, a conclu que la conduite des parties n\u2019y \u00e9tait pas clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9e, que le fardeau de preuve n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas satisfait et que la preuve prima facie n\u2019avait pas \u00e9tabli que le d\u00e9roulement des n\u00e9gociations entreprises entre Mme Mache-Rameau et l\u2019ACDI ou le comportement de sa pr\u00e9sidente, \u00e9taient assimilables \u00e0 un outrage au tribunal.\n[120] Comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait choisi de r\u00e9viser la d\u00e9cision de la Commission en appliquant la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte, elle a conclu que l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice n\u2019avait pas err\u00e9 en d\u00e9cidant de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole, mais pour un motif diff\u00e9rent de celui adopt\u00e9 par l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice dans son Rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Selon la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, l\u2019assimilation du protocole \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour limite la capacit\u00e9 de la Commission ou du Tribunal \u00e0 statuer sur une all\u00e9gation de contravention au protocole : Jugement au para. 59, cit\u00e9 ci-dessus au paragraphe 49.\n[121] Cependant, la norme de contr\u00f4le qui s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. La Cour supr\u00eame est formelle : si les motifs fournis par la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice et ent\u00e9rin\u00e9s par la Commission pour justifier sa d\u00e9cision r\u00e9v\u00e8lent une analyse d\u00e9raisonnable, \u00ab il n\u2019est pas loisible \u00e0 la cour de r\u00e9vision de faire abstraction du fondement erron\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision et d\u2019y substituer sa propre justification du r\u00e9sultat \u00bb : Vavilov au para. 96. En ce faisant, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a err\u00e9 et sa d\u00e9cision ne saurait \u00eatre maintenue.\n[122] Mes coll\u00e8gues affirment qu\u2019\u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des dispositions du protocole, la Commission n\u2019avait d\u2019autre choix que de consid\u00e9rer le non-respect du protocole comme ne relevant plus du Tribunal et de la Commission et de ne pas traiter de cette question. Selon eux, l\u2019omission de la Commission \u00ab d\u2019expliciter davantage \u00bb son raisonnement sur cette question comme l\u2019ont fait par la suite le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne peut entacher la raisonnabilit\u00e9 de la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle elle est arriv\u00e9e. Mais le c\u0153ur du probl\u00e8me n\u2019est pas qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas suffisamment explicit\u00e9 son raisonnement \u00e0 propos de l\u2019impact du libell\u00e9 du protocole sur sa comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 statuer sur le non-respect du protocole. C\u2019est que ce raisonnement est enti\u00e8rement absent, puisque ce n\u2019est pas la justification qu\u2019a offerte la Commission au soutien de son refus de traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole. Comme l\u2019exige la jurisprudence expos\u00e9e ci-dessus au paragraphe 60, la Commission ayant ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 les recommandations de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice, nous devons pr\u00e9sumer que les motifs de la Commission sont ceux expos\u00e9s dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate : qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole parce qu\u2019elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es dans le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage. Lorsqu\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif offre des motifs explicites pour justifier sa d\u00e9cision, une cour de r\u00e9vision doit en \u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re raisonnable \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces motifs : Vavilov au para 84. Or, les motifs de la Commission, qui ne sont ni inexistants ni insuffisants, reposent sur un fondement erron\u00e9 et rendent sa d\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable. Proposer des motifs additionnels bas\u00e9s sur le libell\u00e9 du protocole a l\u2019effet de supplanter plut\u00f4t que de compl\u00e9ter l\u2019analyse de la Commission : Delta Air Lines Inc. c. Luk\u00e1cs, 2018 CSC 2, [2018] 1 R.C.S. 6 aux para. 23\u201324; Vavilov au para. 96.\n[123] Mais il y a plus. Une d\u00e9cision raisonnable doit \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019ensemble du droit et des faits pertinents : Vavilov au para. 105. \u00c0 ce titre, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission \u00e9choue \u00e0 deux \u00e9gards.\n[124] Premi\u00e8rement, la Cour supr\u00eame fait valoir que \u00ab [l]es personnes vis\u00e9es par les d\u00e9cisions administratives sont en droit de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que les affaires semblables soient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tranch\u00e9es de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on et que les r\u00e9sultats ne d\u00e9pendent pas seulement de l\u2019identit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cideur \u00bb : Vavilov au para. 129. Cela est d\u2019autant plus vrai en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, o\u00f9 la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice, en d\u00e9cidant que l\u2019all\u00e9gation de contravention au protocole avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e par le juge Boivin, est parvenue, dans la m\u00eame affaire et sur la base des m\u00eames faits, \u00e0 une conclusion contraire \u00e0 celle de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice, et o\u00f9 la Commission a ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 ces deux conclusions apparemment contradictoires.\n[125] Dans les circonstances, je suis d\u2019avis que la Commission se devait d\u2019expliquer l\u2019\u00e9cart entre ces deux conclusions et son d\u00e9faut de le faire rend sa d\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable : Vavilov au para. 131.\n[126] Deuxi\u00e8mement, les principes de justification et de transparence qui sous-tendent le contr\u00f4le judiciaire selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable exigent que les motifs du d\u00e9cideur administratif tiennent valablement compte des questions et pr\u00e9occupations centrales soulev\u00e9es par les parties : Vavilov au para. 127.\n[127] Cette Cour ne peut pas s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que la Commission, lorsqu\u2019elle exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de rejeter une plainte dans le cadre de ses fonctions d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable, r\u00e9ponde \u00e0 tous les arguments ou modes possibles d\u2019analyse pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par la plaignante, au risque de paralyser son bon fonctionnement et de compromettre les valeurs importantes d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice : Vavilov au para. 128.\n[128] Cependant, comme le r\u00e9it\u00e9rait r\u00e9cemment la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2023 CSC 21, 485 D.L.R. (4e) 583 au para. 97, lorsqu\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif n\u00e9glige de tenir compte d\u2019un argument cl\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 par l\u2019une des parties, elle ne satisfait pas \u00ab \u00e0 la norme fix\u00e9e par l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov en ce qui concerne la justification adapt\u00e9e aux questions et pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es. \u00bb\n[129] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelante dans sa r\u00e9ponse au Rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice que la recommandation de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de ne pas traiter de la contravention all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de l\u2019article 6 du protocole \u00e9tait en contradiction avec la D\u00e9cision sur la recevabilit\u00e9 et, de ce fait, entach\u00e9e d\u2019une erreur fondamentale, \u00e9tait sans aucun doute un argument cl\u00e9. Bien que la Commission affirme avoir examin\u00e9 le Rapport et les observations des parties, elle a agi de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable en omettant totalement d\u2019aborder cet argument cl\u00e9 dans ses motifs.\nD. Le recours appropri\u00e9 [130] Lorsqu\u2019une d\u00e9cision contr\u00f4l\u00e9e selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable ne peut \u00eatre confirm\u00e9e, il conviendra le plus souvent de renvoyer l\u2019affaire au d\u00e9cideur pour qu\u2019il revoit la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des motifs donn\u00e9s par la Cour : Vavilov au para. 141.\n[131] Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce la Cour fait face \u00e0 l\u2019une des circonstances limit\u00e9es dans lesquelles elle devrait refuser de renvoyer la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la Commission. Comme l\u2019affirme la Cour supr\u00eame au paragraphe 142 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov :\n[\u2026 I]l y a des situations limit\u00e9es dans lesquelles le renvoi de l\u2019affaire pour nouvel examen fait \u00e9chec au souci de r\u00e9solution rapide et efficace d\u2019une mani\u00e8re telle qu\u2019aucune l\u00e9gislature n\u2019aurait pu souhaiter. L\u2019intention que le d\u00e9cideur administratif tranche l\u2019affaire en premi\u00e8re instance ne saurait donner lieu \u00e0 un va-et-vient interminable de contr\u00f4les judiciaires et de nouveaux examens. Le refus de renvoyer l\u2019affaire au d\u00e9cideur peut s\u2019av\u00e9rer indiqu\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il devient \u00e9vident aux yeux de la cour, lors de son contr\u00f4le judiciaire, qu\u2019un r\u00e9sultat donn\u00e9 est in\u00e9vitable, si bien que le renvoi de l\u2019affaire ne servirait \u00e0 rien. Les pr\u00e9occupations concernant les d\u00e9lais, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers les parties, le besoin urgent de r\u00e9gler le diff\u00e9rend, la nature du r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9glementation donn\u00e9, la possibilit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle ou non pour le d\u00e9cideur administratif de se pencher sur la question en litige, les co\u00fbts pour les parties et l\u2019utilisation efficace des ressources publiques peuvent aussi influer sur l\u2019exercice par la cour de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de renvoyer l\u2019affaire \u2014 tout comme ces facteurs peuvent influer sur l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de casser une d\u00e9cision lacunaire.\n[Citations omises.]\n[132] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, j\u2019ai conclu que le processus emprunt\u00e9 par la Commission n\u2019a pas priv\u00e9 l\u2019appelante d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et que l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de lacunes fondamentales dans le traitement par la Commission et la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice de la preuve devant elles qui rendraient la D\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable, mise \u00e0 part leur d\u00e9cision de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole. Notamment, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019en \u00e9valuant la Plainte, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a omis de prendre compte des all\u00e9gations de la plainte de 2003. Seule la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, suivant la recommandation de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice, de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole est d\u00e9raisonnable. N\u00e9anmoins, je suis d\u2019avis que si cette Cour renvoyait l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la Commission pour qu\u2019elle revoie sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole, la seule d\u00e9cision raisonnable ouverte \u00e0 la Commission, compte tenu des contraintes juridiques et factuelles que constituent le Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal et le protocole lui-m\u00eame, serait d\u2019exclure de son enqu\u00eate le traitement des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole et de rejeter la Plainte.\n[133] L\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a eu tort d\u2019extrapoler du Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal que la Commission n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence de statuer sur les all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole contenues dans la Plainte. Selon elle, la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal diff\u00e8re de celle de la Commission. Si cette Cour renvoyait cette affaire devant la Commission, cette derni\u00e8re serait contrainte de reprendre son enqu\u00eate, en tenant compte, cette fois, des all\u00e9gations de discrimination relevant du non-respect du protocole, et exercer le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au paragraphe 44(3) de la Loi afin de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu de saisir le Tribunal de la Plainte. Si la Commission d\u00e9cidait de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer la Plainte au Tribunal, ce dernier instruirait la Plainte et, de ce fait, aurait la comp\u00e9tence de se prononcer sur les all\u00e9gations de discrimination, y compris celles relevant du non-respect du protocole.\n[134] L\u2019intim\u00e9 plaide que c\u2019est \u00e0 bon droit que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale affirme que l\u2019assimilation du protocole \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale limite la capacit\u00e9 de la Commission ou du Tribunal de statuer sur une all\u00e9gation de non-respect du protocole. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir qu\u2019il faut donner au paragraphe 48(3) de la Loi le sens que le l\u00e9gislateur voulait lui donner. Cette disposition pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019un r\u00e8glement d\u2019une plainte entre les parties qui est approuv\u00e9 par la Commission peut, par requ\u00eate d\u2019une partie, \u00ab \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance [de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale] et \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 comme telle \u00bb. Pour ex\u00e9cuter une ordonnance, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale doit l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter afin d\u2019en pr\u00e9ciser la port\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9vient que si cette Cour devait reconna\u00eetre que le Tribunal conserve la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9mise en vertu du paragraphe 48(3), il serait possible, par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une nouvelle plainte, de renvoyer ces questions d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation au Tribunal apr\u00e8s quoi l\u2019une des parties pourrait demander \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de sa propre ordonnance par le Tribunal est raisonnable. L\u2019intim\u00e9 plaide que la d\u00e9cision d\u2019une partie d\u2019assimiler une entente approuv\u00e9e par la Commission \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a pour cons\u00e9quence que les parties entrent dans le giron de la Cour quant \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019ordonnance.\n[135] L\u2019appelante r\u00e9plique qu\u2019en l\u2019absence d\u2019une disposition de la Loi retirant express\u00e9ment au Tribunal et \u00e0 la Commission la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter une ordonnance \u00e9mise par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en vertu du paragraphe 48(3), la Cour ne devrait pas donner suite \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui serait contraire aux objets de la Loi, notamment que toute plainte qui n\u2019est pas jug\u00e9e irrecevable fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate et d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Commission en vertu de l\u2019article 44 de la Loi.\n[136] Les parties s\u2019entendent qu\u2019aucune d\u00e9cision, \u00e0 part les jugements des juges Roy et St\u2011Louis de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, ne traite de la question de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal et de la Commission \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter les dispositions d\u2019une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui homologue un r\u00e8glement approuv\u00e9 par la Commission.\n[137] Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour cette Cour de se prononcer ex cathedra sur la question de savoir si, de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, un r\u00e8glement approuv\u00e9 par la Commission et subs\u00e9quemment assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en vertu du paragraphe 48(3) de la Loi, retire au Tribunal et \u00e0 la Commission la comp\u00e9tence de se prononcer sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions du r\u00e8glement. J\u2019estime qu\u2019il est possible de m\u2019en tenir aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[138] Dans sa d\u00e9cision dans Rameau TCDP, Le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 la demande de l\u2019appelante de le saisir de la question de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 6 du protocole pour deux motifs. Premi\u00e8rement, sa comp\u00e9tence en vertu de la Loi est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019instruction d\u2019une plainte. N\u2019\u00e9tant saisi d\u2019aucune plainte, le Tribunal ne pouvait pas se saisir du dossier de l\u2019appelante. Deuxi\u00e8mement, et ce qui est le plus important pour les fins qui nous int\u00e9ressent, le Tribunal a conclu, au paragraphe 58 de sa d\u00e9cision, qu\u2019il ne pouvait faire autrement que d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le paragraphe 16 du protocole comme \u00ab retirant de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive toute comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal au regard de ce protocole d\u2019entente, lequel a identifi\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comme \u00e9tant le nouveau forum l\u00e9gal applicable afin de r\u00e9gler toute m\u00e9sentente en ce qui a trait \u00e0 ce protocole d\u2019entente sign\u00e9 entre les parties \u00bb.\n[139] Au soutien de cette seconde conclusion, le Tribunal a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune disposition du protocole n\u2019avait \u00ab maintenu quelque juridiction que ce soit du Tribunal \u00bb dans le dossier de l\u2019appelante; que les parties avaient accept\u00e9, au paragraphe 15 du protocole, que ce dernier soit assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48(3) de la Loi; et qu\u2019elles s\u2019\u00e9taient aussi entendues, au paragraphe 16 du protocole, pour que toute modification \u00e0 ce dernier d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une reprise de la m\u00e9diation entre les parties \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un diff\u00e9rend concernant sa mise en \u0153uvre soit soumise \u00e0 l\u2019approbation de la Commission conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 48 de la Loi et ait force ex\u00e9cutoire en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale selon les m\u00eames modalit\u00e9s que le protocole initial : Rameau TCDP aux para. 55\u201357.\n[140] Au paragraphe 46 de son Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal rejetant la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de l\u2019appelante \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, le juge Roy a conclu que le Tribunal, par cette analyse des dispositions du protocole, constatait son absence de comp\u00e9tence. Qui plus est, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, aux paragraphes 21 et 28 de ses motifs, que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour se pencher sur la question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 6 du protocole \u00e9tait \u00e0 la fois raisonnable et correcte. \u00c0 la lecture du Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence, je ne peux retenir l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelante selon lequel le juge Roy n\u2019aurait ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 que le premier motif du Tribunal justifiant son absence de comp\u00e9tence d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le protocole, soit l\u2019absence d\u2019une plainte.\n[141] Puisque l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas interjet\u00e9 appel du Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence, celui-ci a un effet juridique d\u00e9finitif et ex\u00e9cutoire et toutes les questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es dans l\u2019instance, dont la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter le protocole conclu entre les parties en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, sont tranch\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive : Canada c.

Puisque le Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence confirme que l\u2019effet du protocole conclu entre les parties en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est de retirer toute comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal au regard du protocole en faveur de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Commission ne pourrait exercer sa discr\u00e9tion en vertu de l\u2019article 44 de la Loi afin de confier au Tribunal l\u2019examen d\u2019all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9es uniquement sur une pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e contravention au protocole.\n[143] Je ne me prononcerai pas sur la question \u00e0 savoir si la Commission et le Tribunal peuvent, de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des mandats qui leurs sont confi\u00e9s par la Loi, interpr\u00e9ter les dispositions d\u2019autres r\u00e8glements intervenus entre d\u2019autres parties qui sont assimil\u00e9s \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale parce que j\u2019estime inutile de le faire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[144] J\u2019exercerais donc mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de r\u00e9paration de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas annuler la d\u00e9cision de la Commission et lui renvoyer l\u2019affaire pour nouvel examen : Maple Lodge Farms Ltd. c.

R\u00e8glement propos\u00e9 [145] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclurais que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est d\u00e9raisonnable, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de l\u2019annuler afin de renvoyer l\u2019affaire puisque la seule d\u00e9cision raisonnable \u00e0 laquelle la Commission pourrait parvenir en cas de nouvelle d\u00e9cision est que la Plainte de l\u2019appelante doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Je suis donc d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\n[146] Les parties ayant chacune gain de cause en partie, je n\u2019adjugerais pas de d\u00e9pens, tant devant notre Cour que devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n\u00ab Gerald Heckman \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nLE JUGE EN CHEF DE MONTIGNY ET LA JUGE GOYETTE (motifs concordants)\n[147] Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec l\u2019analyse de notre coll\u00e8gue concernant le droit applicable. De m\u00eame, nous sommes d\u2019accord avec lui qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de d\u00e9ni d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est raisonnable dans son traitement de la preuve devant elle. Par contre, nous arrivons \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente de la sienne en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas traiter de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de non-respect du protocole.

Faits pertinents [148] Une d\u00e9cision raisonnable doit \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e au regard du droit, mais aussi de l\u2019ensemble des faits pertinents : Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65 au para. 105 [Vavilov]. Les faits pertinents \u00e0 la question de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de non-respect du protocole se r\u00e9sument comme suit.\n[149] Dans sa plainte, l\u2019appelante all\u00e8gue le non-respect du protocole. Elle all\u00e8gue aussi des actes discriminatoires qu\u2019elle distingue du non-respect du protocole. Cette phrase de l\u2019appelante illustre cette distinction : \u00ab Par ailleurs, et mis \u00e0 part la contravention du protocole et l\u2019\u00e9chec de la m\u00e9diation, des \u00e9v\u00e9nements, tels la d\u00e9valorisation de mes comp\u00e9tences et le refus syst\u00e9matique de promotion, se sont succ\u00e9d\u00e9s entre 2009 et 2012, le plus r\u00e9cent \u00e9tant la suppression de mon poste le 11 avril 2012 \u00bb : Formulaire de plainte en date du 28 mai 2012, Dossier d\u2019appel, p. 83.\n[150] La premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice a pour t\u00e2che de faire une recommandation sur la recevabilit\u00e9 de la plainte. Dans son rapport, elle \u00e9crit que la question qui se pose \u00e0 elle est celle de savoir si la Commission devrait refuser de statuer sur la plainte \u00ab parce que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es par le biais d\u2019une autre proc\u00e9dure \u00bb, soit la proc\u00e9dure qui a donn\u00e9 lieu au Jugement sur l\u2019outrage de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Rameau c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 1286). La premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice r\u00e9pond \u00e0 cette question par la n\u00e9gative. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait une analyse de la jurisprudence en la mati\u00e8re, elle recommande \u00e0 la Commission de statuer sur la plainte parce que \u00ab les questions de droit de la personne soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour [f\u00e9d\u00e9rale] et il y a des all\u00e9gations dans la plainte qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour non plus \u00bb. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice mentionne l\u2019all\u00e9gation de suppression du poste de l\u2019appelante.\n[151] Sur la base du rapport de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice et des repr\u00e9sentations des parties \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce rapport, la Commission d\u00e9cide de statuer sur la plainte. Dans sa d\u00e9cision du 19 juin 2013, elle offre pour seul motif au soutien de sa d\u00e9cision : \u00ab Cette plainte contient des all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb.\n[152] Dans son rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice \u00e9crit que les all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par un autre processus\u2014celui de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\u2014et que la Commission n\u2019en traitera pas. Elle ajoute : \u00ab Cependant, quant aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles et de discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, le 19 juin 2013, de statuer sur la plainte (\u2026) parce que la plainte contient des all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb. Le reste du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate examine les all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte autres que celle du non-respect du protocole. Ce faisant, le rapport explique de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9taill\u00e9e les fondements de la recommandation de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice selon laquelle ces autres all\u00e9gations ne justifient pas un examen par le Tribunal.\nII. Analyse [153] Il ressort des paragraphes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents que la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice interpr\u00e8te le r\u00f4le qui lui est confi\u00e9 comme consistant \u00e0 \u00e9valuer les all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte autres que celle de non-respect du protocole. Cette interpr\u00e9tation s\u2019appuie non seulement sur le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage, mais \u00e9galement sur la d\u00e9cision de la Commission du 19 juin 2013, laquelle d\u00e9cision s\u2019appuie \u00e0 son tour sur le rapport de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice. Or, il nous semble tout \u00e0 fait raisonnable de lire le rapport de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice comme signifiant que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination qui doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es par la Commission et dont la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 sont les all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte autres que celle de non-respect du protocole, telle l\u2019all\u00e9gation de suppression du poste de l\u2019appelante. Ainsi, nous ne voyons pas de contradiction entre les conclusions de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice et celles de la deuxi\u00e8me.\n[154] Pour la m\u00eame raison, nous sommes d\u2019opinion que la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice pr\u00e9sente une analyse intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rente et rationnelle au soutien de sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas traiter du non-respect du protocole. Tout simplement, elle fait \u00e9tat de sa compr\u00e9hension\u2014avec r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 l\u2019appui\u2014selon laquelle la question du non-respect du protocole a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e par un autre processus et la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019examiner les autres all\u00e9gations de discrimination de la plainte.\n[155] On peut argumenter que la t\u00e2che de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate en outrage au tribunal se limitait \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le non-respect du protocole constitue un outrage au tribunal et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une analyse exhaustive de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de non-respect du protocole. Il n\u2019en demeure pas moins qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9raisonnable pour la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice et pour la Commission de consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019elles n\u2019avaient pas \u00e0 traiter de la question de non-respect du protocole.\n[156] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il importe de souligner qu\u2019en juillet 2014, lorsqu\u2019elle rend sa d\u00e9cision selon laquelle l\u2019examen de la plainte par le Tribunal des droits de la personne (Tribunal) n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9, la Commission agit apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u de l\u2019appelante une copie du protocole. Le paragraphe 15 du protocole assimile l\u2019entente des parties \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. De plus, le paragraphe 16 pr\u00e9voit que toute modification au protocole n\u00e9goci\u00e9e par les parties afin de r\u00e9gler un d\u00e9saccord concernant sa mise en \u0153uvre aura aussi force ex\u00e9cutoire en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Devant un tel langage, la Commission n\u2019avait d\u2019autre choix que de consid\u00e9rer le non-respect du protocole comme ne relevant plus du Tribunal (ni de la Commission) et par cons\u00e9quent, de ne pas traiter de cette question. Bien qu\u2019il lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 loisible d\u2019expliciter davantage son raisonnement sur cette question, comme l\u2019ont fait subs\u00e9quemment le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Mache-Rameau c. Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international, 2014 TCDP 26 aux para. 55\u201358; Rameau c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CF 1180 aux para. 32\u201334, 38, 40), cette omission n\u2019est clairement pas suffisante pour entacher la raisonnabilit\u00e9 de la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en sont arriv\u00e9es la seconde enqu\u00eatrice et la Commission.\n[157] D\u2019une part, les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal et de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale confirment si besoin \u00e9tait l\u2019absence de toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e des paragraphes 15 et 16 du Protocole et l\u2019absence de juridiction du Tribunal. D\u2019autre part, l\u2019on ne saurait s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un organisme administratif comme la Commission, dont la fonction n\u2019est pas de trancher des litiges mais plut\u00f4t de d\u00e9terminer si une plainte m\u00e9rite d\u2019\u00eatre trait\u00e9e au fond, fournisse des motifs d\u00e9taill\u00e9s et approfondis comme ceux auxquels on est en droit de s\u2019attendre d\u2019un tribunal quasi-judiciaire ou d\u2019une Cour. Tel que l\u2019affirmait cette Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Tazehkand c. Banque du Canada, 2023 CAF 208, aux para. 28\u201340, cit\u00e9 par notre coll\u00e8gue, il faut tenir compte des ressources limit\u00e9es et du volume de travail \u00e9lev\u00e9 de la Commission. Au risque de paralyser compl\u00e8tement le travail et la mission d\u2019un tel organisme, il faut rechercher un \u00e9quilibre entre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des plaignants d\u2019avoir une enqu\u00eate et des motifs les plus complets possibles et les exigences de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 administrative. Dans ce contexte bien particulier, nous estimons que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e au regard des faits et du droit.\n[158] Comme le dit notre coll\u00e8gue au paragraphe 101 de ses motifs, une cour de r\u00e9vision doit lire les motifs d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif de fa\u00e7on globale et contextuelle, eu \u00e9gard au dossier et en tenant d\u00fbment compte du r\u00e9gime administratif dans lequel ils sont donn\u00e9s: Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2021 CAF 157 au para. 15 [Alexion], citant Vavilov aux para. 97, 103. Elle doit aussi s\u2019assurer que le d\u00e9cideur administratif donne suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments pour assurer que les pr\u00e9occupations sur un point central ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en consid\u00e9ration : Alexion, aux para. 13, 19\u201320. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019all\u00e9gation de non-respect du protocole \u00e9tait une des pr\u00e9occupations centrales de la plainte. Nous sommes d\u2019avis qu\u2019un examen du dossier d\u00e9montre que cette pr\u00e9occupation a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Commission. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019examen d\u00e9montre qu\u2019\u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la jurisprudence en la mati\u00e8re, du Jugement sur l\u2019outrage et du texte du protocole, la Commission a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne lui appartenait pas de se prononcer sur la question de non-respect du protocole. Les rapports des enqu\u00eatrices font \u00e9tat du fondement derri\u00e8re cette d\u00e9cision. Ces rapports ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appelante.\nIII. Conclusion [159] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, nous sommes donc d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 et que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission devrait \u00eatre maintenue, le tout avec d\u00e9pens en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n\u00ab Yves de Montigny \u00bb\nj.c.\n\u00ab Nathalie Goyette \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\nA-48-17\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nMARIE MACHE RAMEAU c.

Dans cette d\u00e9cision, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire log\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Section d\u2019appel de l\u2019immigration (SAI) de la Commission de l\u2019immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada, prise en vertu du paragraphe 68(4) de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, L.C. 2001, ch. 27 (LIPR).\n[2] Aux termes de sa d\u00e9cision, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a certifi\u00e9 la question suivante selon l\u2019alin\u00e9a 74(d) de la LIPR:\nL\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s contrevient-il au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, malgr\u00e9 le paragraphe 6(1) de la Charte, et, de ce fait, est-il inop\u00e9rant en vertu de l\u2019article 52 de la Charte?\n[3] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR assimile les infractions appel\u00e9es \u00ab hybrides \u00bb ou \u00ab mixtes \u00bb (infractions pouvant faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une poursuite par mise en accusation ou par proc\u00e9dure sommaire) \u00e0 des infractions punissables par mise en accusation, ind\u00e9pendamment du mode de poursuite effectivement retenu, pour les fins des paragraphes 36(1) et 36(2) de la LIPR.\n[4] La SAI a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR ne contrevenait pas \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, partie I de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, constituant l\u2019annexe B de la Loi de 1982 sur le Canada (R.-U.), 1982, c. 11. Compte tenu du fait que l\u2019appelant avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu coupable d\u2019un acte criminel et qu\u2019il avait par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivi par voie sommaire et reconnu coupable d\u2019une autre infraction mentionn\u00e9e au paragraphe 36(1) de la LIPR, la SAI a conclu que le paragraphe 68(4) de la LIPR trouvait application. Elle a donc annul\u00e9 le sursis \u00e0 la mesure de renvoi et class\u00e9 l\u2019appel.\n[5] L\u2019appelant soutient que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a err\u00e9 en concluant que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR ne violait pas l\u2019article 15 de la Charte.\n[6] Tout en affirmant ne pas attaquer le r\u00e9gime d\u2019expulsion pr\u00e9vu par la LIPR, l\u2019appelant fait valoir notamment qu\u2019en assimilant l\u2019infraction hybride \u00e0 un acte criminel, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR emp\u00eache le justiciable qui n\u2019est pas citoyen canadien de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des effets engendr\u00e9s par le choix du procureur de la Couronne, comme celui d\u2019\u00eatre trait\u00e9 et per\u00e7u \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la gravit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle de l\u2019infraction commise. En d\u2019autres termes, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR laisse croire que le non-citoyen a commis une infraction plus grave que celle pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu coupable. En attribuant aux non-citoyens une dangerosit\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ne pr\u00e9sentent pas r\u00e9ellement, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR, de par ses effets, ostracise les non-citoyens et perp\u00e9tue des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard.\n[7] Comme le pr\u00e9sent appel porte sur une d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale visant une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, cette Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a employ\u00e9 la norme de contr\u00f4le appropri\u00e9e et si elle l\u2019a appliqu\u00e9e correctement. En d\u2019autres termes, lorsque la Cour conclut que la bonne norme de contr\u00f4le a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e, elle doit se mettre \u00e0 la place de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et se concentrer sur la d\u00e9cision ayant fait l\u2019objet du contr\u00f4le judiciaire (Agraira c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2013 CSC 36 aux para. 45-47, r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9e dans Office r\u00e9gional de la sant\u00e9 du Nord c. Horrocks, 2021 CSC 42 aux para. 10-12).\n[8] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, nous sommes d\u2019avis que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a appliqu\u00e9 la norme de contr\u00f4le appropri\u00e9e, soit la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte, puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question constitutionnelle (Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65 aux para. 55-57).\n[9] De plus, nous sommes \u00e9galement d\u2019avis, et ce, essentiellement pour les m\u00eames motifs que ceux de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, que la SAI n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en d\u00e9terminant que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR ne viole pas le paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte.\n[10] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et cette Cour ont r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que le principe le plus fondamental du droit de l\u2019immigration est que le non-citoyen n\u2019a pas un droit absolu d\u2019entrer au Canada ou d\u2019y demeurer. Ce traitement diff\u00e9rent s\u2019explique par le concept m\u00eame de citoyennet\u00e9 et d\u00e9coule express\u00e9ment du paragraphe 6(1) de la Charte, lequel pr\u00e9voit que tout citoyen canadien a le droit de demeurer au Canada, d\u2019y entrer ou d\u2019en sortir. Le l\u00e9gislateur est donc en droit d\u2019adopter une politique en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration et de prescrire par l\u00e9gislation les conditions \u00e0 remplir par les non-citoyens pour qu\u2019il leur soit permis de demeurer au Canada (Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration) c. Chiarelli, [1992] 1 R.C.S. 711 aux pp. 733-734, 736; Chiarelli c. Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration), [1990] 2 C.F. 299 (C.A.F.) aux pp. 310-311; Medovarski c.

Consid\u00e9rant que l\u2019article 6 de la Charte autorise la diff\u00e9rence de traitement entre le citoyen et le non-citoyen, cette diff\u00e9rence ne peut contrevenir \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Charte puisqu\u2019une disposition de la Charte ne peut servir \u00e0 en annuler une autre (Chiarelli C.S.C. \u00e0 la p. 736; Chiarelli C.A.F. \u00e0 la p. 310; Lavoie c. Canada, 2002 CSC 23 au para. 44).\n[11] L\u2019argument de l\u2019appelant selon lequel certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments rattach\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019expulsion pourraient contrevenir \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Charte ne peut r\u00e9ussir. Autre que la distinction entre citoyens et non-citoyens, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a identifi\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment du r\u00e9gime d\u2019interdiction de territoire et d\u2019expulsion qui pourrait ouvrir la porte \u00e0 une contestation en vertu de l\u2019article 15 de la Charte.\n[12] Par ailleurs, lors de l\u2019audience, l\u2019appelant a fait valoir que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR \u00e9tait ambigu. L\u2019appelant ne nous a pas convaincu qu\u2019une telle ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 existe.

La CCI a accord\u00e9 ce montant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande d\u2019ajournement \u00e0 laquelle ce dernier s\u2019opposait.\n[2] Nous sommes tous d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel. La CCI ne pouvait ordonner des d\u00e9pens \u00e0 l\u2019appelant en l\u2019absence de repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites ou orales des parties et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, alors que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est demeur\u00e9 muet sur cet aspect. Les d\u00e9cisions soumises par l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne lui sont d\u2019aucun secours en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En effet, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne nous a pas convaincus que les circonstances tr\u00e8s particuli\u00e8res dans lesquelles ces d\u00e9cisions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues, avalisent le principe selon lequel la Cour puisse unilat\u00e9ralement ordonner des d\u00e9pens en l\u2019absence de repr\u00e9sentations orales ou \u00e9crites par les parties (voir Exeter c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2013 CAF 134 au para. 17; Canada c. Finch, 2002 CAF 194 aux para. 4\u20135; Mand v. Canada, 2023 FCA 94 au para. 7; Balogun c. La Reine, 2005 CAF 350 au para. 2). Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 les d\u00e9pens et l\u2019appelant, par cons\u00e9quent, n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019occasion de faire des repr\u00e9sentations sur la question. Malgr\u00e9 cela, la CCI a ordonn\u00e9 des d\u00e9pens. Son ordonnance porte donc atteinte au principe d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[3] L\u2019appel sera donc accueilli avec d\u00e9pens fix\u00e9s au montant forfaitaire de 2 500$ et l\u2019ordonnance de la CCI (2018-686(IT)G) rendue le 21 mars 2023 sera annul\u00e9e.

Cette demande r\u00e9sultait de cotisations \u00e9tablies par le Ministre pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 1993 \u00e0 1998, et s\u2019appuyait principalement sur les d\u00e9clarations asserment\u00e9es de deux agents de recouvrement retrait\u00e9s de l\u2019Agence du Revenu du Canada qui pr\u00e9tendaient que les cotisations \u00e9taient mal fond\u00e9es.\n[2] Il est maintenant bien \u00e9tabli que notre Cour, lorsqu\u2019elle si\u00e8ge en appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale portant sur une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, doit d\u00e9terminer si le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a choisi la norme de contr\u00f4le appropri\u00e9e et l\u2019a appliqu\u00e9e correctement : Agraira c Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2013 CSC 36, [2013] 2 R.C.S. 559, aux paragraphes 45 et 46; Office r\u00e9gional de la sant\u00e9 du Nord c Horrocks, 2021 CSC 42. En l\u2019occurrence, les parties conviennent que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas err\u00e9 en choisissant la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable.\n[3] Apr\u00e8s avoir s\u00e9rieusement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites et orales de l\u2019appelant, nous sommes tous d\u2019avis que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a bien appliqu\u00e9 la norme de la raisonnabilit\u00e9 et pouvait \u00e0 bon droit rejeter la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Lorsque la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9pondu aux arguments soulev\u00e9s par la partie appelante, cette derni\u00e8re doit nous convaincre que le raisonnement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est erron\u00e9 : Banque de Montr\u00e9al c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2021 CAF 189, au para 4. En l\u2019occurrence, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a soigneusement analys\u00e9 tous les arguments de l\u2019appelant, et ce dernier n\u2019a pas rencontr\u00e9 son fardeau d\u2019identifier une faille dans les motifs de jugement donnant ouverture \u00e0 l\u2019intervention de cette Cour. Au contraire, l\u2019appelant nous invite essentiellement \u00e0 soupeser de nouveau la preuve pour en arriver \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente de celle retenue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Tel n\u2019est \u00e9videmment pas le r\u00f4le de cette Cour lorsqu\u2019elle si\u00e8ge en appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision en contr\u00f4le judiciaire appliquant la norme du caract\u00e8re raisonnable.\n[4] S\u2019agissant plus particuli\u00e8rement des d\u00e9clarations faites par les deux agents de recouvrement, le Ministre a fourni des motifs convaincants pour douter de leur v\u00e9racit\u00e9 et de leur exactitude et, somme toute, pour leur accorder peu de poids. Ces motifs sont intelligibles et appuy\u00e9s par la preuve, comme l\u2019a constat\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et permettaient de repousser la pr\u00e9somption de v\u00e9racit\u00e9 qui s\u2019attache \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration asserment\u00e9e.\n[5] Quant \u00e0 l\u2019importance qu\u2019aurait accord\u00e9e le Ministre au consentement \u00e0 jugement sign\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant, ce dernier ne nous a pas davantage convaincu qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte une entrave dans l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire. Tel que not\u00e9 par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le Ministre pouvait raisonnablement prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du syst\u00e8me fiscal et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9server l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus d\u2019appel dans l\u2019exercice de la discr\u00e9tion tr\u00e8s large en mati\u00e8re de remise que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 23(2) de la Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques, L.R.C. (1985), ch. F-11.\n[6] Enfin, l\u2019appelant a soulev\u00e9 plusieurs erreurs de fait qu\u2019aurait commises le Ministre dans ses motifs au soutien du rejet de sa demande de remise. Ces pr\u00e9tentions ont toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es et rejet\u00e9es par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, et nous sommes \u00e9galement d\u2019avis que les lacunes soulev\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant ne suffisent pas \u00e0 rendre la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable.\n[7] Pour tous ces motifs, l\u2019appel sera rejet\u00e9, avec d\u00e9pens.\n\u00ab Yves de Montigny \u00bb\nJuge en chef\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\nA-219-22\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nDJILLALI-LYES ABDAT c.

Monsieur Manoutchehr Bigdeli-Azari a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le 11 ao\u00fbt 2004 une demande de pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse (SV) et une demande de prestations de Suppl\u00e9ment de revenu garanti (SRG). Cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie en partie, du fait que M. Bigdeli-Azari n\u2019avait pas cumul\u00e9 les ann\u00e9es requises de r\u00e9sidence au Canada pour obtenir une pleine pension. Il a donc obtenu une pension partielle de 10\/40, et les prestations de la SV et de la SRG sont devenues payables \u00e0 partir de juillet 2005.\n[2] Le 20 ao\u00fbt 2007, le fils de M. Bigdeli-Azari (qui repr\u00e9sente \u00e9galement la succession de M. Bigdeli-Azari devant nous) a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme curateur aux biens et \u00e0 la personne de M. Bigdeli-Azari par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec. Un mois plus tard (soit le 25 septembre 2007), le curateur a avis\u00e9 le Ministre que M. Bigdeli-Azari avait quitt\u00e9 le pays, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un enl\u00e8vement. Le Ministre a donc suspendu les prestations de la SV et du SRG de M. Bigdeli-Azari \u00e0 partir du mois d\u2019avril 2008, soit six mois apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9part du Canada.\n[3] En avril 2016, le curateur a communiqu\u00e9 avec le Ministre pour r\u00e9clamer le paiement de toutes les prestations de la SV et du SRG de M. Bigdeli-Azari \u00e0 partir de la date \u00e0 laquelle elles ont cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre vers\u00e9es, au motif que son p\u00e8re aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 r\u00e9sident canadien m\u00eame s\u2019il ne s\u2019y trouvait plus \u00e0 la suite de son enl\u00e8vement. Le Ministre a refus\u00e9, en expliquant que M. Bigdeli-Azari ne pouvait toucher \u00e0 la pension de la SV \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada que pour les six mois suivants son d\u00e9part du Canada, du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas habit\u00e9 au Canada pendant au moins 20 ans apr\u00e8s son 18e anniversaire.\n[4] Finalement, le curateur a avis\u00e9 le Ministre du retour de M. Bigdeli-Azari au Canada en date du 11 ao\u00fbt 2016, et a de nouveau demand\u00e9 le paiement de toutes les prestations de la SV et du SRG ainsi que leur paiement r\u00e9troactif depuis la date o\u00f9 elles avaient cess\u00e9. Le Ministre a cependant re\u00e7u le 18 ao\u00fbt 2016 l\u2019avis de d\u00e9c\u00e8s de M. Bigdeli-Azari, en date du 14 ao\u00fbt 2016.\n[5] Le curateur a par la suite demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision du Ministre autorisant uniquement le versement de la pension de la SV pour le mois de retour au Canada, soit ao\u00fbt 2016. Le Ministre ayant maintenu sa d\u00e9cision initiale, la succession de M. Bigdeli-Azari a fait appel \u00e0 la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sociale. La Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel le 31 mars 2021, et cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par la Division d\u2019appel du m\u00eame Tribunal le 20 octobre 2021. C\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette d\u00e9cision que la succession a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[6] Il est bien \u00e9tabli depuis la d\u00e9cision rendue par cette Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hurtubise c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2016 CAF 147 (aux para. 5-6) que la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable aux d\u00e9cisions rendues par la Division d\u2019appel est celle de la raisonnabilit\u00e9. Notre Cour doit donc d\u00e9cider s\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnable pour la Division d\u2019appel de confirmer la d\u00e9cision de la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, compte tenu du paragraphe 58(1) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social, L.C. 2005, c. 34. Cette disposition n\u2019autorise la Division d\u2019appel \u00e0 intervenir que dans la mesure o\u00f9 la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas observ\u00e9 un principe de justice naturelle, a commis une erreur de droit ou s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur une conclusion de fait erron\u00e9e tir\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance.\n[7] Au terme de la Loi sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse, L.R.C. 1985, c. O-9 (\u00ab la Loi \u00bb), seule une personne ayant r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada pendant au moins vingt ans (apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e2ge de 18 ans) au moment de son d\u00e9part peut toucher une pension de la SV pendant qu\u2019elle se trouve \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada (para. 9(2)). Le paragraphe 9(1) pr\u00e9cise par ailleurs que la pension est suspendue \u00ab apr\u00e8s le sixi\u00e8me mois d\u2019absence ininterrompue du Canada qui suit l\u2019ouverture du droit \u00e0 la pension (\u2026) et il ne peut reprendre que le mois o\u00f9 le pensionn\u00e9 revient au Canada \u00bb. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 21(1)b) du R\u00e8glement sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse, C.R.C., c. 1246 pr\u00e9voit d\u2019autre part qu\u2019une personne est pr\u00e9sente au Canada \u00ab lorsqu\u2019elle se trouve physiquement dans une r\u00e9gion du Canada \u00bb.\n[8] Or, la preuve d\u00e9montre que M. Bigdeli-Azari s\u2019est absent\u00e9 du Canada pendant presque neuf ans, de 2008 \u00e0 2016, apr\u00e8s que la pension partielle de 10\/40 lui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e en juillet 2005. Le demandeur ne conteste pas que M. Bigdeli-Azari ne cumulait pas 20 ans de r\u00e9sidence avant son d\u00e9part du Canada, et ne remet pas en question non plus le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au Canada de 2008 \u00e0 2016. Sa pr\u00e9tention est plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un enl\u00e8vement ne constitue pas un d\u00e9part, et qu\u2019une personne ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e absente \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne quitte volontairement le Canada. Compte tenu du fait que la Loi et le R\u00e8glement sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse ne pr\u00e9voient pas d\u2019exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle selon laquelle la pension est suspendue en cas d\u2019absence de plus de six mois, m\u00eame pour des motifs humanitaires, et que le demandeur ne nous a soumis aucun pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent jurisprudentiel au soutien de son argumentation, la Division d\u2019appel pouvait raisonnablement conclure que la Loi ne lui accorde aucune discr\u00e9tion.\n[9] Nous sommes \u00e9galement d\u2019avis que la Division d\u2019appel pouvait raisonnablement conclure que la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019avait pas fait d\u00e9faut d\u2019observer un principe de justice naturelle ou d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Pour en arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, la Division d\u2019appel a \u00e9cout\u00e9 l\u2019enregistrement de l\u2019audience devant la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale; elle en a retenu que le demandeur n\u2019a soulev\u00e9 aucune objection de proc\u00e9dure, et qu\u2019il a eu l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter sa cause et de faire valoir ses arguments par \u00e9crit et oralement. Ces constats n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remis en question devant nous.\n[10] Enfin, nous sommes tous d\u2019opinion que les arguments fond\u00e9s sur la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s invoqu\u00e9s par le demandeur ne peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s par cette Cour. Dans une d\u00e9cision interlocutoire en date du 3 octobre 2019 (Dossier de la demanderesse, \u00e0 la p. 53), la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a refus\u00e9 d\u2019entendre les arguments du demandeur \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard en s\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 20(1)a) du R\u00e8glement sur le Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale, D.O.R.S.\/2013-60 tel qu\u2019il existait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Cette disposition pr\u00e9voyait qu\u2019une partie d\u00e9sirant soulever l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition devait envoyer un avis au Tribunal contenant la disposition vis\u00e9e et toutes observations \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la question soulev\u00e9e. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le demandeur n\u2019expliquait pas comment la ou les dispositions contest\u00e9es brimaient ses droits constitutionnels. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, la Division d\u2019appel a conclu que la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019avait commis aucune erreur dans son interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 20(1)a) du R\u00e8glement sur le Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale, et que les observations du demandeur \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa contestation constitutionnelle n\u2019\u00e9taient pas suffisamment pr\u00e9cises pour lui permettre de d\u00e9celer les grandes lignes d\u2019un argument fond\u00e9 sur la Charte. Or, le demandeur ne nous a pas convaincus du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[11] Pour tous ces motifs, la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire sera rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\n\u00ab Yves de Montigny \u00bb\nJuge en chef\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\nA-343-21\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nLA SUCCESSION DE MANOUTCHEHR BIGDELI-AZARI c.

La Division d\u2019appel s\u2019est dite d\u2019avis que la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en concluant que le demandeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en raison de son inconduite. La norme de contr\u00f4le qui s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable (Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653).\n[2] Nous avons soigneusement examin\u00e9 les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le demandeur, tant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9crit qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019oral. Nous sommes n\u00e9anmoins d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision de la Division d\u2019appel est raisonnable et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019intervenir dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle est conforme \u00e0 la jurisprudence de cette Cour en la mati\u00e8re (voir Sullivan v.

En effet, le demandeur ayant refus\u00e9 de se conformer \u00e0 la politique de vaccination contre la COVID-19 de son employeur, l\u2019article 30 de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi, L.C. 1996, c. 23 trouve alors application et exclut celui-ci du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, en raison de son inconduite. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement raisonnable pour la Division d\u2019appel d\u2019\u00e9noncer qu\u2019il existe d\u2019autres recours disponibles pour traiter du bien-fond\u00e9 d\u2019un cong\u00e9diement.\n[3] Je rejetterais la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.

Il a port\u00e9 sa cause devant le Conseil canadien des relations industrielles (le Conseil) en vertu du paragraphe 241(3) du Code canadien du travail, L.R.C. 1985, c. L-2 (le Code).\n[2] La pr\u00e9sente affaire d\u00e9coule principalement d\u2019un incident survenu en septembre 2019 (l\u2019Incident) lorsque le demandeur, dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions, a pris l\u2019appel d\u2019une cliente de la d\u00e9fenderesse qui aurait tenu \u00e0 son \u00e9gard des propos racistes. S\u2019en est suivi, selon le demandeur, une s\u00e9rie d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e8nements (suspension sans solde de trois jours, harc\u00e8lement de la superviseure imm\u00e9diate, d\u00e9ductions inexpliqu\u00e9es sur sa paye et promesse non-tenue), qui aurait men\u00e9 \u00e0 sa d\u00e9mission, non-volontaire selon lui, en juin 2022. Le demandeur s\u2019est plaint devant le Conseil que la d\u00e9fenderesse aurait fait d\u00e9faut de mettre en place les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer un milieu de travail sain, exempt de harc\u00e8lement, de discrimination ou de violence, violant ainsi une condition essentielle du contrat de travail, et aurait, dans la foul\u00e9e de l\u2019Incident, adopt\u00e9 un comportement permettant de conclure qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait plus l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00eatre li\u00e9e par ce contrat.\n[3] Le 2 d\u00e9cembre 2022, dans une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9pertori\u00e9e \u00e0 2022 CCRI 1052, le Conseil a rejet\u00e9 la plainte du demandeur, estimant qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu de cong\u00e9diement injuste et que le demandeur avait plut\u00f4t volontairement d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste.\n[4] Devant nous, le demandeur se pourvoit en contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision du Conseil. Il reproche au Conseil des manquements aux r\u00e8gles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, une erreur de droit et des erreurs de fait et de droit.\n[5] En mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, la Cour doit elle-m\u00eame d\u00e9terminer, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du dossier qui est devant elle, s\u2019il y a eu manquement (Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique Limit\u00e9e c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CAF 69 au para. 54). Ici, le demandeur soutient que le Conseil aurait mis trop de temps \u00e0 entendre la plainte, lui aurait refus\u00e9 d\u2019enregistrer les audiences, l\u2019aurait priv\u00e9 d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve important en jugeant non-pertinent, dans une d\u00e9cision interlocutoire, l\u2019enregistrement de l\u2019Incident, alors qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019audience elle a permis, \u00e0 la demande de la d\u00e9fenderesse, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une version partielle de cet enregistrement, et aurait accept\u00e9 la demande de la d\u00e9fenderesse de disjoindre la question des dommages sans v\u00e9ritablement expliqu\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision.\n[6] Nous sommes tous d\u2019avis que ces arguments ne peuvent r\u00e9ussir. D\u2019une part, quant au d\u00e9lai \u00e0 traiter sa plainte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en janvier 2020, le demandeur a reconnu \u00e0 l\u2019audience devant nous que la pand\u00e9mie de la COVID-19 pouvait expliquer le d\u00e9lai. La Cour note aussi qu\u2019\u00e0 partir de l\u2019automne 2021, et jusqu\u2019au d\u00e9but des audiences, en juin 2022, le Conseil a eu \u00e0 traiter de multiples questions pr\u00e9liminaires en lien avec la plainte du demandeur. Bref, cet argument est sans fondement, sans compter que le demandeur n\u2019a pas fait la preuve d\u2019un quelconque pr\u00e9judice en lien avec ce d\u00e9lai. Quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Conseil de ne pas permettre l\u2019enregistrement des audiences, celui-ci est ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure et n\u2019a pas pour pratique de le permettre. En outre, le demandeur n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ce qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 en l\u2019instance est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement accord\u00e9 aux plaignants qui comparaissent devant le Conseil. Cela vaut aussi pour la d\u00e9cision du Conseil de disjoindre la question des dommages, ce qui se fait relativement couramment. Finalement, l\u2019argument fond\u00e9 sur le d\u00e9p\u00f4t, \u00e0 l\u2019audience, d\u2019une version partielle de l\u2019enregistrement de l\u2019Incident n\u2019a aucun m\u00e9rite puisque rien n\u2019en retourne, le Conseil ayant tenu pour av\u00e9r\u00e9, aux fins de son analyse, que le demandeur avait fait l\u2019objet de propos inacceptables lors de l\u2019Incident.\n[7] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019erreur de droit et aux erreurs de fait et de droit imput\u00e9es au Conseil, c\u2019est suivant la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable que nous devons les examiner (Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65 (Vavilov)). Le demandeur soutient, pour l\u2019essentiel, que le Conseil aurait err\u00e9 en droit en omettant de consid\u00e9rer que la d\u00e9fenderesse avait fait d\u00e9faut de lui communiquer les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e en marge de l\u2019Incident et de tenter de r\u00e9gler la situation \u00e0 l\u2019amiable. Cela constituerait, selon lui, une violation d\u2019une condition essentielle du contrat de travail donnant ouverture \u00e0 une conclusion de cong\u00e9diement injuste. Quant aux erreurs de fait et de droit, elles seraient de deux ordres : d\u2019une part, le Conseil n\u2019aurait pas mesur\u00e9 convenablement l\u2019impact de la suspension sans solde de trois jours qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fenderesse dans les semaines qui ont suivi l\u2019Incident, laquelle d\u00e9montrerait que la d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019avait plus l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00eatre li\u00e9e par le contrat de travail; d\u2019autre part, il se serait m\u00e9pris sur le caract\u00e8re volontaire de sa lettre de d\u00e9mission de mai 2022.\n[8] Encore ici, le demandeur ne nous a pas convaincus qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019intervenir. Comme nous le lui avons expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable est une norme d\u00e9f\u00e9rente, m\u00eame lorsque le Conseil interpr\u00e8te le Code (Vavilov au para. 49; Payne c. Banque de Montr\u00e9al, 2013 CAF 33 aux para. 33, 81). Comme c\u2019est le cas du contr\u00f4le judiciaire des d\u00e9cisions de la plupart des tribunaux administratifs sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s en relations de travail au Canada, une d\u00e9f\u00e9rence consid\u00e9rable s\u2019impose ici \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision du Conseil est fortement domin\u00e9e par les faits et qu\u2019elle est du type de celles que le Conseil rend r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Alexis, 2021 CAF 216; Rouet c. Canada (Justice), 2023 CAF 50).\n[9] La norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable signifie que nous devons nous abstenir de reconsid\u00e9rer la d\u00e9cision du Conseil, r\u00e9\u00e9valuer la preuve, mettre en doute les conclusions tir\u00e9es par le Conseil et y substituer les n\u00f4tres (Vavilov au para. 83). Notre r\u00f4le consiste plut\u00f4t \u00e0 nous assurer, avec une \u00ab attention respectueuse \u00bb, que la d\u00e9cision du Conseil repose sur un raisonnement rationnel et logique et qu\u2019elle se situe, au niveau du r\u00e9sultat, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la fourchette des issues possibles et acceptables en regard des faits de l\u2019affaire et du droit applicable (Vavilov au para. 84; Dunsmuir c. Nouveau-Brunswick, 2008 CSC 9 au para. 47).\n[10] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, nous sommes d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision du Conseil poss\u00e8de les attributs de la raisonnabilit\u00e9 : le Conseil a bien identifi\u00e9 le test juridique \u00e0 deux volets applicable aux cas de cong\u00e9diements injustes entrepris en vertu du Code, fait une revue minutieuse de la preuve administr\u00e9e devant lui, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les arguments du demandeur, et tir\u00e9 les conclusions qui, selon lui, s\u2019imposaient en regard des faits mis en preuve et du droit qui leur \u00e9tait applicable. Ce faisant, il a appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des divers t\u00e9moignages qu\u2019il a entendus, une t\u00e2che qui est au c\u0153ur de son mandat et de son expertise. Sa d\u00e9cision est \u00e9toff\u00e9e, rationnelle, logique et support\u00e9e par la preuve. Dans une affaire ax\u00e9e sur les faits, le demandeur devait en faire davantage, pour que nous intervenions, que d\u2019exprimer de simples d\u00e9saccords avec la d\u00e9cision du Conseil.\n[11] Pour toutes ces raisons, la pr\u00e9sente demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire sera rejet\u00e9e. Comme la d\u00e9fenderesse ne les r\u00e9clame plus, elle le sera sans d\u00e9pens.\n\u00ab Ren\u00e9 LeBlanc \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\nA-271-22\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nYASSINE ESSA\u00cf c.
