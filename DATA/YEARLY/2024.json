In 2012, the appellant subscribed for shares in two junior mining companies, in each case pursuant to a memorandum of understanding (MOU) entered into by the appellant or an affiliate. Each of the mining companies had a mining project it hoped to develop.\n[2] While each MOU contemplated that the appellant would be engaged to provide services in connection with the development and later operation of the relevant mine, each also contained several other terms relevant to the ongoing relationship between the junior mining company and the appellant and its affiliates.\n[3] Neither project proceeded and, in 2013, the appellant sold the shares of both companies to a related corporation at a loss. The appellant deducted the resulting losses in computing its income for the 2013 taxation year. The Minister reassessed the appellant on the basis that the losses were capital losses not deductible in computing income. The Tax Court of Canada dismissed the appeal of that reassessment (2022 TCC 71 per Boyle J.) and the appellant now appeals that decision to us.\n[4] The Tax Court\u2019s decision must be reviewed under the appellate standard of review established by Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33. This means questions of law are reviewed on a correctness standard and questions of fact or mixed fact and law are reviewable for palpable and overriding error.\n[5] The appellant submits that the Tax Court made three errors of law:\n1. Because the shares did not themselves produce income and the Tax Court found they were held and used in the appellant\u2019s business, the appellant says they are inventory, relying on Canada Safeway Limited v. Canada, 2008 FCA 24 (Canada Safeway).\n2. Because the shares were \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to, \u201ca necessary and integral part of\u201d, and \u201cacquired in the course of\u201d the appellant\u2019s services business, but not used in that business, the appellant says the loss was an income loss, citing Morguard Corporation v. The Queen, 2012 TCC 55, aff\u2019d 2012 FCA 306, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 35183 (25 April 2013) (Morguard Corporation), Glencore Canada Corporation v. The Queen, 2021 TCC 63 (Glencore Canada), and Johns-Manville Canada v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 46, 21 D.L.R. (4th) 210 (Johns-Manville).\n3. The Tax Court did not apply the test to determine whether the shares were acquired as an adventure in the nature of trade, and here the appellant had a secondary intention of selling the shares at a profit.\n[6] I cannot agree and therefore would dismiss the appeal.\n[7] Deciding whether a particular outlay or receipt is on income or capital account, or a particular property is capital property, is often difficult. In each case, that determination must be made with regard to the particular facts, having regard to various factors and all the surrounding circumstances: Canada Safeway at para. 61; Hillsdale Shopping Centre Ltd. v. The Queen, [1981] C.T.C. 322, 81 D.T.C. 5261 (FCA) at 327 (C.T.C.). It is necessarily a highly factually infused determination. Fact-finding is the purview of the Tax Court, not this Court on appeal.\n[8] Before the Tax Court, the parties submitted a partial agreed statement of facts and a joint book of documents. Only Mr. Yurkowski, the founder, president, and chief executive officer of the appellant, testified.\n[9] Over more than six pages of its reasons, the Tax Court summarized the evidence concerning the appellant and the share acquisitions. It found the shares \u201cwere acquired and held \u2026in connection with [the appellant\u2019s] business\u201d, \u201cwere not acquired for trading purposes\u201d, and \u201cconstituted an investment \u2026in the equity of the [mining companies]\u2026 intentionally [made]\u2026with a view to further strategically enhancing its future growth, and recoveries\/cash flow generated from its business.\u201d: Reasons at paras. 1, 10. It said \u201c[t]he evidence \u2026 overwhelmingly supports [those] findings\u201d: Reasons at para. 11.\n[10] I agree.\n[11] Although the appellant says the Tax Court erred in law, in effect it is asking us to review the evidence and make our own findings of fact, apply legal principles, and then come to our own conclusion. For example, the appellant says dividends were not expected to be paid on the shares, pointing to testimony from Mr. Yurkowski. Similarly, the appellant states that it contemplated the shares might increase in value in which case it might sell the shares, again pointing to Mr. Yurkowski\u2019s testimony.\n[12] Referencing a particular statement made by a witness does not permit this Court to make the factual findings the appellant desires, particularly where the Tax Court expresses concerns about the credibility of the testimony, as it did here. It expressly questioned the completeness of the \u201cdescription of the circumstances of the acquisition of the shares by the Appellant\u2019s [witness] in his testimony\u201d, requiring it \u201cto look beyond [the appellant\u2019s] own description of [its] intention, motivation, reason or purpose for having done something, and to effectively test that against the other objective evidence\u201d: Reasons at para. 11.\n[13] Here, neither the Tax Court nor the agreed statement of facts addressed the appellant\u2019s or the issuer\u2019s intentions concerning dividends on the shares following development of the mining project. Moreover, Mr. Yurkowski was equivocal regarding the appellant\u2019s plans for holding or disposing of the shares. During examination in chief, he described the appellant\u2019s goal as \u201cforming long-term joint ventures\u201d and the share acquisitions as \u201cthe first step to a long 20-, 30-year deal\u201d. The witness also testified that \u201c[w]hether or not we ever sold the shares was immaterial\u201d and when the appellant \u201cbought equity in a company [it] was to keep it as long as [it] possibly could\u201d.\n[14] Likewise, counsel and the courts must exercise care in considering the application of statements drawn from other cases. Read in light of the context in which they were made, statements that appear to mandate a particular characterization of an outlay or receipt, or acquisition or disposition, as being on income or capital account are not, in fact, unequivocal, but rather have a meaning that differs from that which the words on their face might suggest. Each case must be decided on the basis of its own facts and circumstances.\n[15] The appellant says that once the Tax Court found that a sale of the shares was inevitable, it must have viewed a future sale at a profit as a motivating factor in the acquisition, consistent with the testimony of its witness. Again, I disagree.\n[16] Although the Tax Court used the phrase \u201cinevitable sale\u201d at paragraph 10 of its reasons, the relevant sentence cannot be read in isolation. Read in the context of the statements that immediately precede it, and the Tax Court\u2019s reasons in their entirety, it cannot be seen as a finding that the appellant established an intention to sell the shares at a profit.\n[17] That the appellant may have \u201ccontemplated the possibility of resale of [the shares] is not, in itself, sufficient to conclude \u2026 the existence of an adventure in the nature of trade\u201d: Canada Safeway at paras. 61, 70. Rather, the prospect of resale must be an important consideration, or an operating motivation, for the acquisition: Canada Safeway at para. 61, see also paras. 46-59 where this Court discusses other relevant cases; Crystal Glass Canada Ltd. v. The Queen, [1989] 1 C.T.C. 330, 43 D.T.C. 5143 (FCA) at 330 (C.T.C.). As I have already explained, the evidence here supported more than one interpretation of the appellant\u2019s intention and I see no reason to interfere with the Tax Court\u2019s conclusions.\n[18] Contrary to the appellant\u2019s submission, the Tax Court did turn its mind to whether the shares could have been acquired as an adventure in the nature of trade. It quoted a passage from Canada Safeway addressing the distinction between inventory and capital property in that context: Reasons at para. 17. However, in neither its notice of appeal, nor its submissions to the Tax Court, did the appellant posit that the share acquisitions were adventures in the nature of trade. The Tax Court said not taking that position was consistent with the agreed statement of facts: Reasons at para. 21. In other words, the facts did not support finding an adventure in the nature of trade.\n[19] Finally, the appellant submits that Morguard Corporation, Glencore Canada, and Johns-Manville \u201cdemonstrate that losses incurred by disposing of property that is \u2018inextricably linked\u2019 to the ongoing operation of the business are on income account\u201d: appellant\u2019s memorandum of fact and law at para. 86. Had the Tax Court applied those cases, says the appellant, it \u201cwould have held that the Appellant acquired and disposed of the Shares in the course of an undertaking\u201d and that \u201cthe Losses were business losses\u201d: appellant\u2019s memorandum of fact and law at para. 106.\n[20] I cannot agree with the appellant\u2019s characterization of the three cases it cites, nor their relevance to this appeal. First, Morguard Corporation and Glencore Canada concern negotiated break fees received after a failed acquisition, not dispositions of property. Moreover, they were decided based on their particular facts and circumstances, as all of these cases must be.\n[21] As to Johns-Manville, the Tax Court considered it, but viewed it as inapplicable. I agree. It concerns property acquired for consumption in the business, the cost of which the Court there described as \u201cnot part of a plan for the assembly of assets\u201d: at 73. Here, the Tax Court found the shares were an investment made with a view to providing the appellant with long-term revenue and earnings, a finding amply supported by the evidence.\n[22] As I have noted, although the appellant asserts errors of law, it asks us to reweigh the evidence and substitute our views for those of the Tax Court. We cannot interfere with the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings, and findings of mixed fact and law, absent a palpable and overriding error.\n[23] I see no error that warrants our intervention and therefore I would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondent.\n\"K.A.

The two are identical, there being no confidential information disclosed in the confidential reasons.\nLOCKE J.A.\nI. Background [1] This is an appeal of a decision of the Federal Court (2022 FC 62, per Justice Michael D. Manson) in the context of an action brought pursuant to subsection 6(1) of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations, S.O.R.\/93-133 (the Regulations). In that action, the respondents, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. (collectively, Janssen), sought a declaration that the appellant, Pharmascience Inc. (Pharmascience), would infringe Canadian Patent No. 2,655,335 (the 335 Patent) if it were to make, use or sell its generic version of Janssen\u2019s patented medicine called INVEGA SUSTENNA.\n[2] INVEGA SUSTENNA involves a suspension of paliperidone palmitate for the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders. The 335 Patent teaches a regimen to achieve an optimum plasma concentration-time profile. It teaches a first loading dose administered in the deltoid muscle on day 1, a second loading dose administered in the deltoid muscle on day 8, and then monthly maintenance doses thereafter administered either in the deltoid or gluteal muscle. For non-renally impaired patients, the first and second loading doses are 150 and 100 mg equivalent (mg-eq.), respectively, and the monthly maintenance doses are 75 mg-eq. each. For renally impaired patients, the first and second loading doses are 100 and 75 mg-eq., respectively, and the monthly maintenance doses are 50 mg-eq. each.\n[3] Pharmascience brought a motion for summary trial or, alternatively, for dismissal of Janssen\u2019s action pursuant to section 6.08 of the Regulations, on the basis that its product would not infringe the 335 Patent since it would not provide the 75 mg-eq. dose, which is an essential element of all of the claims thereof. The Federal Court dismissed Pharmascience\u2019s motion. In the context of the summary trial, the Federal Court decided the infringement issue in favour of Janssen, finding that Pharmascience would induce infringement of the 335 Patent with its generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA. The action was allowed to proceed on the patent validity issues that had been raised by Pharmascience. That trial resulted in a decision (2022 FC 1218, 198 C.P.R. (4th) 329), which is the subject of an appeal before this Court (File No. A-205-22). That appeal has been heard and remains under reserve at the time these reasons for judgment have been released.\n[4] The legal test for a finding of inducing patent infringement was correctly stated by the Federal Court at paragraph 93 of its reasons:\nThere is a three \u201cprong\u201d test for inducement: (1) direct infringement by a third party; (2) the inducer influenced the third party to the point that the infringing act would not have occurred without the influence; and (3) the defendant knew that its influence would bring about the infringing act [Corlac Inc. v. Weatherford Canada Ltd., 2011 FCA 228 [Corlac]].\n[5] The Federal Court found that each of the prongs of the test was satisfied. In the present appeal, Pharmascience takes issue only with the first prong. Specifically, Pharmascience argues that the Federal Court erred in finding that direct infringement would result from use of its generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA, if the 75 mg-eq. dose were sourced from Janssen.\n[6] For the reasons set out below, I would dismiss this appeal.\nII. The Federal Court\u2019s Decision [7] The Federal Court addressed the first prong of the test for inducing infringement at paragraphs 95 to 120 of its reasons.\n[8] It first addressed Pharmascience\u2019s argument that any activities falling within the scope of the claims of the 335 Patent would be licensed for prescribing physicians and therefore not infringing (see paragraphs 96-102 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons). According to Pharmascience, this is because whenever a physician would prescribe or otherwise use Pharmascience\u2019s generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA, any such activities would require use of a 75 mg-eq. dose, which would be available only from Janssen. Pharmascience argued that, in the absence of limitations imposed by Janssen at the time of sale, a 75 mg-eq. dose that Janssen sells would include an implied license to use the 75 mg-eq. dose in any way the purchaser or prescribing physician chooses, including in the claimed dosing regimens with other doses obtained from an unlicensed source like Pharmascience.\n[9] The Federal Court considered some of the jurisprudence on the issue of the implied license and concluded that it did not apply to the 75 mg-eq. dose. It reasoned that the implied license relates to a patented article itself, and the 75 mg-eq. dose alone is not a patented article. It is merely one component thereof.\n[10] It is this portion of the Federal Court\u2019s analysis on the first prong of the test for inducing infringement that is the focus of Pharmascience\u2019s argument in this appeal.\n[11] The remainder of the Federal Court\u2019s analysis on the first prong concerned issues that are no longer in dispute. These included whether Pharmascience\u2019s product monograph contained instructions concerning the use of the 75 mg-eq. dose, and whether said product monograph would cause prescribers to change their practices regarding prescribing the 75 mg-eq. dose.\nIII. Standard of Review [12] The parties agree that the standard of review applicable in this case is as set out in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. Questions of law are reviewed on a standard of correctness, and questions of fact or of mixed fact and law from which no question of law is extricable are reviewed on a standard of palpable and overriding error. A palpable error is one that is obvious. An overriding error is one that goes to the very core of the outcome of the case. When arguing palpable and overriding error, it is not enough to pull at leaves and branches and leave the tree standing. The entire tree must fall: Canada v. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 FCA 165, [2012] F.C.J. No. 669 at para. 46 (cited with approval in Benhaim v. St-Germain, 2016 SCC 48, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 352 at para. 38).\nIV. Analysis [13] Central to Pharmascience\u2019s argument that the Federal Court erred in failing to recognize the extent of the implied license in this case is the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Eli Lilly & Co. v. Novopharm Ltd., [1998] 2 S.C.R. 129, 161 DLR (4th) 1 (Eli Lilly). That case involved a compulsory licence that was granted to Novopharm to manufacture and import bulk nizatidine. Novopharm entered into a supply agreement with Apotex whereby the former would provide the latter with nizatidine to be formulated into capsules. The dispute concerned whether the licensed nizatidine that Apotex acquired from Novopharm included an implied licence to manufacture capsules from the bulk nizatidine.\n[14] In addressing this point, the Supreme Court of Canada at paragraph 99 adopted the following text from the Federal Court of Appeal decision in that case:\nIf a patentee makes a patented article, he has, in addition to his monopoly, the ownership of that article. And the ownership of a thing involves, as everybody knows, \u201cthe right to possess and use the thing, the right to its produce and accession, and the right to destroy, encumber or alienate it\u201d.... If the patentee sells the patented article that he made, he transfers the ownership of that article to the purchaser. This means that, henceforth, the patentee no longer has any right with respect to the article which now belongs to the purchaser who, as the new owner, has the exclusive right to possess, use, enjoy, destroy or alienate it. It follows that, by selling the patented article that he made, the patentee impliedly renounces, with respect to that article, to [sic] his exclusive right under the patent of using and selling the invention. After the sale, therefore, the purchaser may do what he likes with the patented article without fear of infringing his vendor\u2019s patent.\nThe same principles obviously apply when a patented article is sold by a licensee who, under his licence, is authorized to sell without restrictions. It follows that, if Apotex were to purchase bulk Nizatidine manufactured or imported by Novopharm under its licence, Apotex could, without infringing Lilly\u2019s patents, make capsules from that substance or use it in any other possible way. [SCC\u2019s emphasis.]\n[15] The Supreme Court of Canada went on as follows:\n100 Perhaps the principles underlying this well-founded statement of the law merit some brief elaboration at this stage. As I have already noted in connection with the distinction between a sublicence and an ordinary agreement of purchase and sale of a patented or licensed article, the sale of a patented article is presumed to give the purchaser the right \u201cto use or sell or deal with the goods as the purchaser pleases\u201d: see Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik v. Isler, [[1906] 1 Ch. 605], at p. 610. Unless otherwise stipulated in the licence to sell a patented article, the licensee is thus able to pass to purchasers the right to use or resell the article without fear of infringing the patent. Further, any limitation imposed upon a licensee which is intended to affect the rights of subsequent purchasers must be clearly and unambiguously expressed; restrictive conditions imposed by a patentee on a purchaser or licensee do not run with the goods unless they are brought to the attention of the purchaser at the time of their acquisition: see National Phonograph Co. of Australia, Ltd. v. Menck, [1911] A.C. 336 (P.C.).\n101 Therefore, it is clear that, in the absence of express conditions to the contrary, a purchaser of a licensed article is entitled to deal with the article as he sees fit, so long as such dealings do not infringe the rights conferred by the patent. On this score, Eli Lilly alleges that the reformulation of nizatidine would in this case exceed the scope of the rights obtained by the purchaser because it would constitute not simply the resale of the material purchased, but rather, the creation of a new article in violation of Eli Lilly\u2019s patent. However, I can find no basis, either in the evidence or in the case law cited by Eli Lilly, for this submission. In my view, the reformulation of nizatidine into final-dosage form does not have the effect of creating a new article. Rather, it is more akin to repackaging the substance into a commercially usable form, which I do not view as violating any rights under the patents.\n[16] So it is clear that the sale of a patented article without restriction includes the right to use that article as the purchaser pleases. This much is not in dispute. This principle is well supported by prior jurisprudence: Thomas v. Hunt (1864), 17 C.B.N.S. 183, 144 E.R. 74 at 76; Betts v. Willmott (1871), L.R. 6 Ch. App. 239, 19 W.R. 369 at 245; Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik v. Isler (1906), 1 Ch. 605, 75 L.J. Ch. 411 at 610, aff\u2019d [1906] 2 Ch. 443, 23 R.P.C. 633 (C.A.); Hatton v. Copeland-Chatterson Co. (1906), 37 S.C.R. 651 at 653; Gillette v. Rea, [1910] O.J. No. 587, 15 O.W.R. 345 at para. 2; National Phonograph Company of Australia Ld. v. Menck, [1911] A.C. 336, 28 R.P.C. 229 at 234, 238, 246, 248 (U.K.P.C.); Signalisation de Montr\u00e9al Inc. v. Services de B\u00e9ton Universels Lt\u00e9e, [1993] 1 F.C. 341, [1992] F.C.J. No. 1151 at paras. 17, 20 (C.A.). The principle is also supported by jurisprudence subsequent to Eli Lilly: Apotex Inc. v. Merck & Co., 2002 FCA 210, [2002] F.C.J. No. 811 at para. 39; Distrimedic Inc. v. Dispill Inc., 2013 FC 1043, [2013] F.C.J. No. 1093 at para. 226 (Distrimedic); Angelcare Canada Inc. v. Munchkin, Inc., 2022 FC 507, [2022] F.C.J. No. 480 at para. 276 (Angelcare).\n[17] Janssen argues that this principle does not apply in this case. It notes that the article it would sell in the scenario before this Court (the 75 mg-eq. dose) is not itself a patented article, but merely a component of a patented invention that includes several different doses. Janssen argues that the jurisprudence concerning implied license is limited to the patented article itself, and therefore the purchase from Janssen of only the 75 mg-eq. dose would not carry with it an implied license to combine that dose with other doses obtained from Pharmascience to practise the patent invention.\n[18] Pharmascience disputes the distinction based on whether the article sold is the whole patented article or merely one component. It refers to Slater Steel Industries Ltd. v. R. Payer Co. Ltd., (1968) 55 C.P.R. 61, 38 Fox Pat. C. 139 (Ex. Ct.) (Slater Steel), which concerned a patent on a helically shaped rod wound around an electric power transmission line. The claims concerned the combination of the rod and the transmission line. The Exchequer Court noted that the patentee and its Canadian licensee in that case \u201cmake use of the patents, not by manufacturing the combination that is the subject of the patents, but by manufacturing the preformed armour rods and selling them to power companies who use the rods to create such combination by applying them to their transmission lines.\u201d The Court went on to observe that, \u201c[n]o licence has been granted under the patents to any person in Canada to create the combination covered by the patents except the implied licence flowing from the sale of the preformed armour rods\u201d (see page 65).\n[19] The Exchequer Court concluded that the defendant, who supplied a competing rod, had not infringed because it had not directly infringed by making the patented combination, and had not induced its customer to do so. Nevertheless, Pharmascience urges this Court to conclude from the words at the end of the sentence quoted at the end of the previous paragraph (\u201cexcept the implied licence flowing from the sale of the preformed armour rods\u201d) that the sale of one component of a patented combination includes an implicit license to use the combination.\n[20] I am not prepared to draw such a general conclusion from this statement by the Exchequer Court more than 50 years ago in obiter dicta. In my view, the context of the transaction is relevant. In the context of Slater Steel, it appears to have been implicit that the purchaser from the patentee of a pre-formed rod as described in the patent in suit was entitled to use that rod on the patented combination. It does not appear that the purchaser was expected also to source its transmission lines from the patentee. Any implied license would be restricted to making the combination with rods made or sold by the patentee. In the absence of any pleading or evidence otherwise, the Court declined to find that an implied license existed. The Exchequer Court discussed this issue at page 86 of the decision.\n[21] However, the same does not necessarily apply in the present case. There appears to be no reason to conclude that either Janssen or its customers (a prescribing physician or a patient) would have understood that the purchase of paliperidone palmitate in a single dose from Janssen would include an implied licence to use the entire dosing regimen of the product in combination with other doses obtained from unlicensed sources, to practise the invention of the 335 Patent. It is difficult to accept that there could be such an implied licence in circumstances where neither the supposed licensor nor the supposed licensee would have understood such a licence to exist.\n[22] Pharmascience also cites the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Distrimedic. In the relevant portion of that case, Distrimedic was accused of inducing infringement of patent claims to a pill-sorting device and a device for opening a set of pill containers with a knife. There was no evidence that Distrimedic had sold any such device, but Distrimedic had sold pill containers to pharmacists who had obtained such devices from the patentee. It appears that the allegation was that those pharmacists used the patentee\u2019s devices with Distrimedic\u2019s pill containers, and were induced to do so by Distrimedic. Among the reasons cited by the Federal Court for dismissing this argument was that the patentee \u201cmust be presumed to have acquired an implicit right to use [the devices] without restriction\u201d (see paragraph 226 of its reasons).\n[23] In my view, this decision can be of little assistance to Pharmascience because the pill-sorting device and device for opening a set of pill containers were the subject of distinct claims that were not interdependent. Hence, the purchase of these items from the patentee was the purchase of the patented article, and not a mere component thereof. This decision does not support the principle that sale of a mere component of a patented invention includes an implied license to use the patented invention without restriction, as Pharmascience urges.\n[24] For its part, Janssen relies on this Court\u2019s decision in MacLennan v. Produits Gilbert Inc., 2008 FCA 35, [2008] F.C.J. No. 128 (MacLennan). The patent in that case concerned a system for replacing damaged or used saw teeth on tooth holders used in circular saws for feller heads in the forestry industry. The idea was to minimize losses by facilitating tooth replacement. The appellants sold the combination of the teeth and tooth holders. They alleged inducing patent infringement by the respondent, which manufactured and sold replica replacement teeth to be used by the appellants\u2019 customers with tooth holders purchased from the appellants.\n[25] The appellants were successful in establishing that the respondent induced patent infringement by its sale of the replica teeth. Janssen notes that the fact that the customers had purchased one component of the patented combination (the tooth holders) from the appellants did not avoid a finding that they had directly infringed the patent. Clearly, the Court in MacLennan found no implied licence for the purchasers of the appellants\u2019 tooth holders to use them with other components of the patented combination that had been obtained from unlicensed sources. Janssen argues that the facts in MacLennan are on all fours with those in the present appeal.\n[26] Pharmascience seeks to distinguish MacLennan on the basis that the debate there concerned the extent of the implied right of a purchaser to repair. The respondent there had argued that the teeth required replacement because of ordinary use, and the purchaser had an implied license to repair its tooth holders by replacing the damaged or used teeth. This Court disagreed. It found that the focus of the patented invention in that case was the easy replacement of teeth, and therefore their replacement was not repair but remaking of the invention (see MacLennan at paragraph 23). Pharmascience argues that the present appeal is distinguishable from MacLennan in that it concerns the right to use an invention rather than the right to remake it.\n[27] I do not agree with the distinction that Pharmascience urges. On my reading, this Court in MacLennan refused to deal with an implied licence to repair because of the nature of the invention there. Nothing in that conclusion contemplates a broad implied licence to use a patented article. In fact, the finding of inducement there indicates that purchasers of tooth holders from the patentee did not obtain an unlimited right to use them in the patented combination.\n[28] Further support for the approach described in MacLennan is found in the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Angelcare. That case involved a patent on a combination of a pail for storing soiled diapers and a cartridge of plastic film for use in the pail. Among other things, the defendants were accused of inducing infringement by selling cartridges for use in the appellants\u2019 pail. One of the defences was that purchasers of the plaintiffs\u2019 pails had obtained an implied licence to use them as they please, including with cartridges purchased from the defendants. The argument was that, with such an implied licence, there could be no act of direct infringement upon which to base an allegation of inducement. The Federal Court addressed MacLennan at paragraphs 278 to 280 of its reasons in Angelcare. It found no basis to distinguish MacLennan and concluded that there was inducement to infringe.\n[29] In both of these cases, the patented invention constituted a combination invention and therefore, the sale of a mere component of it was insufficient to grant the implied right to use the entire combination. To grant an implied licence, the sale of the entire combination had to occur, or at least, as in Slater Steel, the parties\u2019 intended use of the component at the time of sale contemplated its use in the patented combination.\n[30] In summary, I am not convinced that the Federal Court erred in any way in its finding that users of Janssen\u2019s 75 mg-eq. dose with Pharmascience\u2019s doses in other amounts would directly infringe the 335 Patent and hence that the first prong of the test for inducing patent infringement would be met.\n[31] Pharmascience argues, in the alternative, that the Federal Court erred in not limiting its findings of inducing infringement to claims 17 to 32 of the 335 Patent, which concern the use of a dosage form according to the claimed dosing regimens. The other claims of the 335 Patent concern prefilled syringes adapted for administration according to the claimed dosing regimens (claims 1 to 16), the use of paliperidone as paliperidone palmitate in the manufacture\/preparation of a medicament adapted for administration according to the claimed dosing regimens (claims 33 to 48), and a dosage form adapted for administration according to the claimed dosage regimens (claims 49 to 63).\n[32] I am not convinced that the Federal Court erred in this respect either. Just as with claims 17 to 32, all of the other claims of the 335 Patent would be directly infringed by a physician or a patient using Pharmascience\u2019s generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA with 75 mg-eq. doses sourced from Janssen. Moreover, just as with claims 17 to 32, all such direct infringement would be induced by Pharmascience.\nV. Conclusion [33] It follows from the foregoing that I would dismiss the present appeal. I would award costs to Janssen in the agreed amount of $10,000, all-inclusive.\n\"George R.

The applicant argues that the Crown failed to meet its pre-surrender fiduciary obligation, and should have withheld its consent or at least guaranteed a minimal impairment of the First Nation\u2019s interest in the reserve land because the exchange was so foolish and improvident that it amounted to an exploitative bargain.\n[2] After a 6-day hearing involving 5 experts, 5 oral history witnesses and 3 days of oral arguments, the Specific Claims Tribunal (the Tribunal) ruled that the Saulteaux Band\u2019s understanding of the terms of the surrender was adequate, that the surrender did not constitute an exploitative bargain, and that Canada was not required to ensure minimal impairment of the Saulteaux Band\u2019s interests in the reserve land in the context of the 1960 surrender: Saulteaux First Nation v. Canada, 2023 SCTC 1 (the SCT Decision).\n[3] For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the Tribunal did not make any reviewable error justifying the intervention of this Court. Indeed, most of the arguments raised by the applicant amount to a mere disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the evidence. Needless to say, it is not the role of a reviewing Court to reweigh or reassess the evidence, nor to interfere with the decision-maker\u2019s factual findings.\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND [4] Treaty 6 was signed at Forts Carlton and Pitt in 1876; its provisions included reserves set apart for the signatory First Nations. At the time, the Saulteaux First Nation did not enter the treaty. It only adhered to Treaty 6 in 1954 and 1956.\n[5] In 1905, some members of Saulteaux First Nation petitioned the Indian Agent for a reserve on Jackfish Lake, where they lived and supported themselves by fishing and hunting. Numerous letters were then exchanged between the Department of the Interior and the Department of Indian Affairs to determine the amount and exact location of lands to be set apart as a reserve for the members of Saulteaux First Nation at Jackfish Lake. The lands marked off for the members of Saulteaux First Nation at Jackfish Lake were then surveyed, and by Order in Council P.C. 2617, IR 159 was confirmed. It consisted of three parcels of land totalling 9,010.869 acres. Two of the three parcels (the Surrender Land)\u2014totalling approximately 207 acres\u2014were located on the waterfront of Jackfish Lake. These two parcels included plenty of sandy beach shorelines and provided excellent fishing resources. For the history surrounding the creation of IR 159, see SCT Decision at paras. 15\u201320.\n[6] Jackfish Lake has been known as a prime recreational destination in Saskatchewan since as early as 1905. The Province made numerous attempts to acquire the Surrender Land and commissioned two reports which made recommendations with respect to the purchase or lease of parcels of IR 159. On June 12, 1947, the Saskatchewan Premier wrote to the Minister of Mines and Resources of Canada, alleging that the Saulteaux First Nation \u201cpetitioned\u201d to transfer their residence from IR 159 to the north side of Birch Lake. In response to the Premier\u2019s letter, the Inspector of Indian Agencies noted that he was \u201cvery doubtful that the majority of the Indians of this band desire to make the exchange\u201d. As a result of a Band meeting on August 18, 1947, where the idea of transferring their residence to Birch Lake was rejected, the Acting Minister of Mines and Minerals of Canada informed the Saskatchewan Premier on September 12, 1947 that the Saulteaux First Nation had \u201cno desire of making a move to the suggested location\u201d and advised \u201cthat there is no further action the Indian Affairs Branch can take in the matter\u201d.\n[7] In 1953, the Government of Saskatchewan commissioned a report (Investigation of Recreational Facilities and Potentials in Northwestern Saskatchewan, also known as the \u201cBrown Report\u201d) investigating lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan for recreational potential. Jackfish and Murray Lakes were identified as \u201can exceedingly attractive recreational area\u201d, with Jackfish Lake especially having recreational beaches and good fishing. The report stated there were only two potential multi-use recreational sites on Jackfish Lake that were unoccupied and undeveloped, and these were two non-contiguous lakeshore parcels both within IR 159. The Brown Report recommended that the province obtain title to the northern parcel only, and leave the southern parcel for the Band.\n[8] In a further report released in September 1956 (A Report on Recreation Conditions of Jackfish & Murray Lakes, also known as the \u201cBaker Report\u201d), which focused on the recreational conditions at Jackfish and Murray Lakes, the opposite recommendation was made, i.e., that the southern non-contiguous lakeshore parcel of IR 159 be purchased or leased by the province, and the northern section be left as reserve because \u201csome first-class beach must be left to the Reservation\u201d.\n[9] In the wake of these two reports, the Deputy Minister of Natural Resources of Saskatchewan asked the Deputy Minister of Citizenship and Immigration of Canada on March 4, 1958, about procuring title of certain portions of IR 159. Following a Band meeting to discuss the issue, the Superintendent of the Battleford Agency reported to the Regional Supervisor of the Department of Citizenship on March 18, 1958, that members \u201ccame forward one after another objecting to the disposal of these parcels of land and advised that they would not entertain any further discussion relating to the selling of any part of their Reserve\u201d. This was confirmed by the Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies of Saskatchewan to the Superintendent of Reserves and Trusts of Canada in a letter dated March 21, 1958.\n[10] In a letter dated March 26, 1958, the Deputy Minister of Citizenship and Immigration of Canada notified the Deputy Minister of Natural Resources of Saskatchewan of the Band\u2019s decision to unanimously vote against disposing of their land, as it would close off access to fishing grounds and would make the Reserve too small for the needs of the Band. The letter also added that the Saulteaux First Nation might be convinced to change their mind if certain conditions were met. Because the applicant is making much of that part of the letter, it is worth reproducing it in full:\nI do not know whether it would be possible to induce the members of the Band to alter their opinion, but if the Indians can be assured of continuing access to the fishing grounds and should there be conveniently located land under the control of the Province that could be exchanged for the land required by your Department, it might be worthwhile to discuss the matter further with the Indians. If the matter is to be taken up with the Indians again, it might be helpful if a representative of your Department met with them to explain your requirements in detail and to work out an acceptable arrangement for compensation either in terms of money or an exchange for other land owned by the Province.\n[11] In a subsequent letter to his provincial counterpart, Deputy Minister Fortier stated that \u201cit may be that an arrangement can be worked out that will be acceptable to the Indian band\u201d, and expressed the opinion that the best way to deal with the matter would be for a representative of Saskatchewan to meet with members of the Band. He added that his officials would attempt to facilitate such a meeting. On June 13, 1958, the Superintendent of the Battleford Agency wrote to his regional supervisor to let him know that there had been no further development, and expressed the view that \u201cthe Band members would not consider to sell any part of their reserve\u201d and that \u201cit will not serve any good purpose to re-open the talk with the members of the Band unless the Provincial Government has a very generous offer to make\u201d. It appears from the record that no meeting took place between Saskatchewan and the Saulteaux Band before October 1959.\n[12] While the Saulteaux First Nation was against the idea of selling their land in exchange for other provincial lands during that period of time, they demonstrated an interest in leasing. In a letter dated March 17, 1958, the Superintendent of Reserves and Trusts of Canada wrote to the Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies of Saskatchewan, noting that \u201cthere might be a possibility of some sort of lease offered\u201d but no possibility of selling \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d.\n[13] There is further evidence of an interest in leasing in the Battleford Agency\u2019s quarterly report dated March 31, 1958. It was noted that \u201c[f]or the last two years, it had been brought to the attention of the Saulteaux Indian Band to consider the leasing for camping\u201d. The report indicated that a meeting was held for the purpose of leasing and a \u201cmajority of the members were favourable toward the project\u201d, as it could be a \u201cgood source of revenue\u201d. Moreover, on August 7, 1959, a Band meeting was held, where \u201cmost of the voting members favoured leasing the land\u201d.\n[14] Notwithstanding the Saulteaux First Nation\u2019s initial refusals to sell the Surrender Land in exchange for other provincial lands, and their documented interest in leasing, a \u201cBand Council Document\u201d with typed signatures dated October 13, 1959, indicated that a meeting was held at the Chief of the Saulteaux First Nation\u2019s home the day prior, and that the \u201cBand was willing to negotiate with the Government of Saskatchewan for the sale of certain portions of the Saulteaux Reserve bordering the North Shore of Jack Fish Lake\u201d. The Band Council Document contained a detailed description of the requested exchange land, a request for a supplementary payment of $20,000 and \u201cas a condition of sale, that all mineral rights be included\u201d. It appears that the meeting was held without the presence of any federal official.\n[15] On October 23, 1959, that Document was sent to the Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies of Saskatchewan by the Superintendent of the Battleford Agency. On October 29, 1959, the Deputy Minister of Natural Resources of Saskatchewan sent to the Band a proposal for the exchange of Indian Reserve lands on Jackfish Lake for lands in the Provincial Forest at Birch Lake. The proposal included the transfer of 297 acres of IR 159 in exchange of 5,363 acres of provincial land, $20,000 and mineral rights on one section of the land.\n[16] In response, the Saulteaux Band Council prepared a signed Band Council Resolution on November 2, 1959, stating that the proposal \u201chas been read and is fully understood by us\u201d, and \u201cis accepted\u201d, and requesting that the \u201cIndian Affairs Branch proceed with \u2026 the surrender vote\u201d.\n[17] The next day, the Superintendent of the Battleford Agency wrote to the Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies of Saskatchewan, describing the Exchange Land and asking to arrange for a surrender vote. In that letter, the Exchange Land was described as significantly larger\u2014about 4,400 more acres than the Surrender Land. Moreover, part of the Exchange Land was suitable for growing \u201cfair quality slough hay\u201d, offered some hunting and trapping of \u201cplentiful\u201d wild game and fur-bearing animals, had potential for livestock raising and grazing, and had more attractive mineral rights than Jackfish Lake. That being said, the Superintendent of the Battleford Agency also wrote that the remaining portions of the Exchange Land were \u201crolling and sandy, of no agricultural value\u201d, had limited fishing resources and had little timber of limited commercial value. He nevertheless expressed the opinion that the transaction \u201cwill be of benefit for the Indians\u201d.\n[18] On November 5, 1959, the Regional Supervisor for Saskatchewan wrote a letter to the Chief of Reserves and Trusts Division of Canada, expressing how the transaction \u201cwill definitely benefit the Indians\u201d, does not \u201chesitate in recommending it be approved\u201d, and finally, \u201cadmit[s] that the proposal presented to the Indians by the Province of Saskatchewan is very fair and reasonable\u201d. Further, the Regional Supervisor acknowledged how Saskatchewan was \u201cdoing the best they can in granting the mineral rights on 640 acres in the exchange area to the Indians concerned\u201d.\n[19] On December 2, 1959, the Deputy Minister of Natural Resources of Saskatchewan wrote to the Deputy Minister of Citizenship and Immigration of Canada, stating how it was pleased that its proposal was found to be acceptable, and that the Saulteaux First Nation would \u201cenjoy the same privileges as the public for lake access and recreation\u201d. On that same date, the Chief of Reserves and Trusts Division of Canada wrote to the Regional Supervisor for Saskatchewan stating that the surrender documents would be sent to the Superintendent of the Battleford Agency for consideration by the Saulteaux First Nation once a legal description was completed and on receipt of confirmation from the provincial government authorities that the terms were acceptable from a provincial point of view.\n[20] Yet on October 8, 1959\u2014just five days before the Saulteaux First Nation Council expressed its intention to negotiate with Saskatchewan for the sale of certain portions of IR 159\u2014the Chief of Reserves and Trusts Division of Canada allegedly sent surrender documents to the Superintendent of the Battleford Agency relating to a proposal to lease. Having been made aware of that correspondence in early December, he therefore wrote to the Regional Supervisor for Saskatchewan on December 7, 1959, suggesting that the lease proposal be withheld. The Chief of Reserves and Trusts Division of Canada stated:\nFurther to my letter of December 2, 1959, it has now come to our attention that we have been carrying out correspondence with the Agency office with respect to a surrender of the Fractional N.E. \u00bc of Section 10-48-17 W3M. It appears that the Saulteaux Band would like to lease this area for summer resort purposes.\nThe above proposal conflicts with the exchange to the Province as the area in question is part of the 207 acres it is proposed to transfer. It is suggested that if the surrender documents sent to the Agency with our letter of October 8, 1959, have not yet been presented to the Band, that they be withheld until surrender documents are forwarded with respect to the 207 acres it is proposed to exchange. with the Province.\nIt is interesting to note that at a Band meeting held August 7, 1959, most of the voting members favoured leasing the land, and perhaps while the Band Council favours the proposed exchange, the majority could well disapprove.\n[21] Then, on December 21, 1959, the Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies of Saskatchewan asked the Superintendent of the Battleford Agency to \u201cadvise if there is some misunderstanding amongst the Indians in regards to surrender for sale, as it would appear that the Saulteaux Band would like to lease this area for summer resort purposes\u201d. Two days later, the Superintendent of the Battleford Agency responded, stating that it \u201creturned the Surrender Document for a proposed lease of Saulteaux Indian land to headquarters\u201d because they are \u201cno longer interested in leasing\u201d following the Government of Saskatchewan\u2019s second proposal for acquiring IR 159 in exchange for other provincial lands.\n[22] It is in this context that a vote was held on January 25, 1960 on the proposed surrender of portions of IR 159 in exchange for other provincial lands at Helene Lake and Birch Lake, located approximately 65 kilometres northeast of IR 159. By memorandum dated December 30, 1959, the Chief of Reserves and Trusts Division of Canada asked the Superintendent of the Battleford Agency \u201cthat the proposed surrender meeting be given the widest publicity possible in order to insure that as many voting members attend as is possible to have\u201d.\n[23] Of the 82 voting members that were eligible to vote, 60 were present. Of the 60, 52 were in favour of selling, while 8 were against. The Minutes taken at the meeting showed that 1) the Saulteaux First Nation recommended an interpreter who was sworn to interpret the meeting from English to Cree, and vice versa, and no objections were noted regarding the selection of the interpreter; 2) the Superintendent of the Battleford Agency read the terms of the surrender\u2014which were translated by the interpreter\u2014and asked if the terms were understood, and there were no recorded questions; and 3) a representative of Saskatchewan stated that \u201cthe Indian people would have the same right to use the [surrendered] land as the White people\u201d.\n[24] Following the majority vote, the Chief of the Saulteaux First Nation and two councillors executed the surrender form with the Superintendent of the Battleford Agency signing on behalf of Canada. The proposal made its way up to official government channels, and on February 18, 1960, Canada passed Order in Council PC 1960-178, officially accepting the surrender.\n[25] On March 10, 1960, Canada passed Order in Council PC 1960-297, transferring administration and control of the land described in the surrender to Saskatchewan. On May 9, 1960, Saskatchewan passed Order in Council 785\/60, authorizing the purchase of the Surrender Land, as well as the transfer of the administration and control of the land at Birch Lake with payment of $20,000 to the Superintendent General of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration of Canada, in trust for the Saulteaux First Nation.\n[26] Ultimately, the Surrender Land became \u201cThe Battlefords Provincial Park\u201d, and the Exchange Land was designated as Saulteaux Indian Reserve No. 159A.\nII. THE SPECIFIC CLAIMS TRIBUNAL DECISION [27] On December 10, 2008, the applicant filed a claim with the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties by the respondent. This claim was not accepted for negotiation, on the basis that Canada had no outstanding obligation. As a result, the applicant filed a Declaration of Claim with the Specific Claims Tribunal on December 3, 2013, seeking compensation and damages for the respondent\u2019s alleged breach of its pre-surrender fiduciary obligations that it owed to the applicant.\n[28] On January 18, 2023, the Tribunal reached its decision and determined that Canada did not breach its pre-surrender fiduciary duty owed to the applicant since the surrender did not constitute an exploitative bargain. To arrive at its conclusion, the Tribunal reviewed the jurisprudence to define the nature of the fiduciary obligation between the Crown and First Nations in the context of a surrender, which includes \u201cloyalty, good faith, full disclosure\u201d and the \u201cprotection \u2026 of the First Nation\u2019s quasi-proprietary interest from exploitation\u201d (SCT Decision at para. 87, citing Southwind v. Canada, 2021 SCC 28 at para. 64 (Southwind)). In addition to exploring what constitutes exploitation in the context of reserve land surrenders, the Tribunal equally noted that the avoidance of exploitative bargains was at the very heart of the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duty, and that there must also be a balance between autonomy and protection (SCT Decision at paras. 83\u201384).\n[29] The Tribunal then made the following findings, on the basis of the record before it:\n-The surrender and exchange were neither foolish nor improvident when viewed from the Band\u2019s perspective at the time, and Canada did not breach its fiduciary duty to the Band by accepting the surrender;\n-The Band\u2019s understanding of the surrender terms was adequate;\n-There were no tainted dealings on the part of Canada that would make it unsafe to rely on the Band\u2019s understanding and intention;\n-Canada was not required to ensure minimal impairment of the Band\u2019s interest in the reserve land in the context of the 1960 surrender.\nIII. ISSUES [30] In its written and oral submissions, the applicant raises a number of issues, most of which go to the assessment of the evidence or to the interpretation of certain documents. It also raises a few questions of mixed fact and law pertaining to Canada\u2019s pre-surrender fiduciary duty and to its duty of minimal impairment. Ultimately, I am of the view that the issues to be decided on this application for judicial review are the following:\nDid the Specific Claims Tribunal err in finding that Canada met its pre-surrender fiduciary duty?\nDid the Specific Claims Tribunal err in determining that there was no duty of minimal impairment?\nDid the Specific Claims Tribunal breach the principles of procedural fairness?\nIV. ANALYSIS [31] The parties are in agreement, and rightly so, that the applicable standard of review is that of reasonableness on the first two questions. This is the presumptive standard of review when considering the merits of an administrative decision. In Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 (Vavilov), the Supreme Court indicated that this presumption will be rebutted when the legislature has opted for a different standard, or where the rule of law requires the standard of correctness. This will be the case for constitutional questions, general questions of central importance to the legal system as a whole, and for questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies (Vavilov at paras. 23\u201325, 53, 55, 58\u201362, 69\u201370).\n[32] These circumstances do not arise here, nor do they in most instances where the Tribunal rules on the scope and asserted breach of fiduciary duties owed by Canada to Indigenous peoples. The jurisprudence of the Supreme Court and of this Court in that respect has been consistent over the years (see, e.g., Williams Lake Indian Band v. Canada (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development), 2018 SCC 4 at para. 27; Williams Lake First Nation v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 2021 FCA 30; Witchekan Lake First Nation v. Canada, 2022 FCA 52 at para. 2; Ahousaht First Nation v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 2021 FCA 135 at paras. 44\u201345 leave to appeal to SCC refused, 39847 (3 March 2022); Kahkewistahaw First Nation v. Canada (Crown-Indigenous Relations), 2024 FCA 8 (Kahkewistahaw)).\n[33] When applying the reasonableness standard, a reviewing court must show deference to the decision-maker. The focus of the reasonableness review must be the decision that was made, and courts should refrain from deciding the issue afresh or coming up with the decision it would have made had it been seized of the issue in the first place. Attention must therefore be given to the reasons provided, with a view to determining whether the decision falls with a range of acceptable outcomes. As the Supreme Court cautioned, the reasons given by an administrative body must not be assessed against a standard of perfection. The reviewing court must therefore look at the reasons with sensitivity to the institutional setting and in light of the record, and ask itself whether the decision bears the hallmark of reasonableness\u2014justification, transparency and intelligibility\u2014and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision (Vavilov at para. 99; Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 at paras. 47, 74). That being said, a reviewing court should resist the temptation to supplement the reasons of the decision-maker when they contain a fundamental gap or when the chain of analysis is defective. As the Supreme Court cautioned in Vavilov, \u201ceven if the outcome of the decision could be reasonable under different circumstances, it is not open to a reviewing court to disregard the flawed basis for a decision and substitute its own justification for the outcome\u201d (Vavilov at para. 96).\n[34] As for issues pertaining to procedural fairness, there is no need for a standard of review analysis. As this Court stated in Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 at paras. 34\u201356, the ultimate question in assessing procedural fairness is whether the applicant knew the case to meet and had a fair chance to respond.\nA. Did the Specific Claims Tribunal err in finding that Canada met its pre-surrender fiduciary duty? [35] As previously mentioned, the Tribunal first set out the law with respect to the sui generis fiduciary duty owed to Indigenous peoples in respect of surrendered reserve lands. As mentioned in Guerin v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335 (Guerin), where the Supreme Court of Canada, for the first time, characterized the relationship between the Crown and First Nations as a fiduciary relationship, the Crown first took this responsibility upon itself in the Royal Proclamation of 1763, and the surrender provisions of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5 (the Act) requiring that Canada consent to a surrender of reserve land still recognize this duty (Guerin at 379, 383\u2013384; the Act, ss. 18(1)). The requirement that Canada consent to a surrender of reserve land is clearly meant to prevent First Nations from being exploited by third parties.\n[36] The nature of the duty owed by the Crown when a band wishes to surrender its reserve was taken up again by the Supreme Court in Blueberry River Indian Band v. Canada (Department of Indian Affairs & Northern Development), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 344 (Blueberry). In that case, the Bands contended that the Crown should not have allowed them to surrender their reserve since this was not in their long term best interest. According to the Bands, the paternalistic tone of the Act imposes a duty upon the Crown to protect the Indians from themselves. The Court rejected that contention, being of the view that the Act strikes a balance between autonomy and protection, and reiterating that the purpose of the requirement of the Crown\u2019s consent is to prevent exploitation, not to substitute the Crown\u2019s decision for that of the Band. While that view was expressed in separate reasons by McLachlin J. (with the support of Cory and Major JJ.), it was endorsed by all seven members of the Court. It is also worth noting that the exploitative character, improvidence or foolishness of a surrender must be considered from the perspective of the Band at the time of the surrender, not with the benefit of hindsight (Blueberry at para. 36). Also of interest is the caveat expressed by Gonthier J., writing for the majority, that the Band\u2019s understanding of terms of the surrender must be adequate, and that the conduct of the Crown must not have tainted the dealings to such an extent that it would be unsafe to rely on the Band\u2019s understanding or intention (Blueberry at para. 14).\n[37] In its latest pronouncement on that issue, the Supreme Court reviewed its earlier jurisprudence and summarized the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duty applicable to the surrender of reserves in the following manner:\nThe fiduciary duty imposes the following obligations on the Crown: loyalty, good faith, full disclosure, and, where reserve land is involved, the protection and preservation of the First Nation\u2019s quasi-proprietary interest from exploitation. The standard of care is that of a person of ordinary prudence in managing their own affairs. In the context of a surrender of reserve land, this Court has recognized that the duty also requires that the Crown protect against improvident bargains, manage the process to advance the best interests of the First Nation, and ensure that it consents to the surrender [citations omitted].\nSouthwind at para. 64, cited by the Tribunal at para. 87 of its decision.\n[38] With these guiding principles in mind, I will now determine whether it was unreasonable for the Tribunal to find that Canada met its pre-surrender fiduciary duty.\n[39] The applicant put forward a number of submissions in support of their claim that the surrender bargain was foolish and exploitative. First, they claim that the Tribunal erred in fact when it concluded that the mineral rights on the Exchange Land were more attractive than the mineral rights on the Surrender Land. The applicant argues that not only was the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion based on a single \u201coffhand opinion\u201d, but it also did not take into account Saskatchewan\u2019s position that it was \u201cdoing the best they can\u201d by granting mineral rights on 640 acres of land, considering that most of the mineral rights on the Exchange Land were held by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\n[40] The applicant also claims that the commercial fishery on Jackfish Lake was of utmost importance for the Saulteaux Band, and that approving a transaction that did not contain an assurance of access to Jackfish Lake was a breach of fiduciary duty. Yet, the applicant argues, the Tribunal failed to consider that issue.\n[41] Furthermore, the applicant contends that the Tribunal erred in preferring the valuation method used by two expert witnesses which valued the Exchange Land similar to, or even higher than, the Surrender Land, as opposed to a different valuation method used by a different expert witness that valued the Exchange Land less than the Surrender Land. More particularly, the applicant is of the view that the Tribunal erred in choosing to use exclusively the Direct Comparison Approach (DCA) instead of using it in conjunction with the Subdivision Development Approach (SDA), on the basis that the Surrender Land was not ripe for development. In the applicant\u2019s opinion, such a conclusion is unreasonable as it ignores the context in which the surrender took place. The applicant also questions the exclusion by the two Crown experts of two lands directly adjacent to the Surrender Land in their assessment of the historic market value of the Surrender Land. Finally, the applicant argues that the Tribunal erred when it stated that the opinion of both Crown experts was that the surrender bargain was fair and reasonable from the perspective of the Saulteaux Band, as it is not for experts to opine on a legal issue.\n[42] In my opinion, the applicant has not met its burden of demonstrating that the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the evidence is unreasonable. The Tribunal carefully considered the record and the submissions of the Saulteaux Band, and concluded that the surrender it negotiated with Saskatchewan was neither foolish nor improvident when viewed from the Band\u2019s perspective at the time. This conclusion is grounded in the evidence that was before the Tribunal, and its reasons are justified, transparent, and intelligible.\n[43] On the loss of access to fishing grounds, the Tribunal noted that the Saulteaux First Nation remained in possession of 8,803 acres of IR 159, and that this portion of the reserve borders Murray Lake and provided good fishing (SCT Decision at para. 91). As for the attractiveness of the mineral rights in the Exchange Land, it was based on the available evidence and it was only one consideration among many. The Tribunal also considered the following factors: a) 207 acres of land at Jackfish Lake was exchanged for 4,970 acres at Birch Lake and Helene Lake; b) the Exchange Land was neither remote nor inaccessible; c) the Exchange Land was suitable for growing slough hay, limited livestock grazing, some hunting and trapping and some development potential in the nature of large acreage locations for residential structures associated with the surrounding agricultural use land; d) the sum of $20,000 was paid in addition to the Exchange Land; and e) the mineral rights on the Exchange Land were more attractive than those on the Surrender Land. It is on the basis of all these factors that the Tribunal came to its conclusion that the exchange was not foolish and that Canada did not breach its fiduciary duty by consenting to the surrender.\n[44] As for the applicant\u2019s submissions regarding the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the historical values of the Surrender Land and the Exchange Land, I am of the view that they are without merit. The Tribunal conducted a thorough analysis of the three expert land appraisals submitted in evidence, and explained why the DCA assessment approach was in its view the preferable methodology. In particular, the Tribunal accepted the expert evidence of Mr. Love, who testified on behalf of the respondent, that the Surrender Land was not ripe for immediate development, and that too much speculation would be required on a number of variables to make the SDA an appropriate method of land assessment. It is not for a reviewing court to decide the issue for itself, or to conduct a de novo analysis of the issue. When conducting a reasonableness review, the focus must always be on the reasons provided by the decision-maker, with a view to ascertaining their internal coherency and to determining whether the decision is justified in light of the applicable facts and law. The applicant has not convinced me that the Tribunal made a reviewable error in concluding, based on the record that was before it, that the surrender and exchange it had negotiated with the Government of Saskatchewan was either foolish or improvident.\n[45] The Tribunal then considered whether the Band\u2019s understanding of the terms of the surrender was adequate. After having carefully considered the evidence and the applicable law on the subject, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the Saulteaux First Nation had an appropriate understanding of the surrender and understood as early as 1947 Saskatchewan\u2019s desire to purchase the Surrender Land. The Tribunal found that while the Band opposed Saskatchewan\u2019s efforts in 1947 and again in 1958, it took steps to open negotiations in late 1959 and set out terms and conditions to the bargain that had not been historically offered by Saskatchewan and not previously considered by the Saulteaux First Nation. The Tribunal further found that at a meeting held at the home of the Chief of the Saulteaux First Nation on October 12, 1959, the Band Council defined the terms and condition of the bargain contemplated, the most significant of which was the exchange of portions of its reserve land bordering Jackfish Lake for land bordering Helene Lake and Birch Lake. The Tribunal concluded that Saskatchewan essentially accepted those terms and merely refined them for clarity and detail.\n[46] Saskatchewan approved the offer made by the Band Council on October 30, 1959, and on November 2, 1959, the Saulteaux Band Council prepared a Band Council Resolution (BCR) stating that Saskatchewan\u2019s proposal \u201chas been read and is fully understood by us. Said proposal is accepted and it is our request that the Indian Affairs Branch proceed with the preparation of the necessary documents for the surrender vote\u201d. Canada therefore recommended the proposal upon request of the Band, and made reasonable efforts to ensure informed participation in the surrender vote by Saulteaux First Nation members, including; a) appointing an interpreter who was chosen at the recommendation of the Saulteaux First Nation Band Council; b) asking Saulteaux First Nation members in attendance whether they were satisfied with the selection of the interpreter and confirming there were no objections, and; c) asking attendees if the conditions of surrender were understood and if anyone had any questions after the conditions of the surrender were translated.\n[47] Counsel for the applicant challenges this narrative, and claims that the surrender proposal did not originate with the Saulteaux Chief and Council but rather with Saskatchewan. They rely for that proposition on a number of facts. First, they note that there were no federal officials in attendance at the October 12, 1959 meeting that purportedly gave rise to the October 13, 1959 document. Second, they refer to a letter by Saskatchewan Deputy Minister of Natural Resources to the Battleford Agency Superintendent dated October 28, 1969 wherein he referred to \u201cour proposal\u201d for the exchange of Indian lands at Jackfish Lake for lands at Birch Lake. Third, they note that the October 13, 1959, document mentions specific plots of land, which they argue the Band could not have independently known were all Crown-held lands. Finally, they point to the language of the BCR dated November 2, 1959, which accepted the \u201cproposal of the Department of Natural Resources, Government of Saskatchewan\u201d.\n[48] I think it is fair to say that the genesis of the potential land exchange is far from clear. While the documents to which counsel for the applicant draws the Court\u2019s attention appear to confirm that the proposal originated with Saskatchewan, the fact remains that the language of the October 13, 1959 document is to the effect that the Band is willing to negotiate with Saskatchewan for the sale of some portions of its reserve land on the basis of specific terms and conditions. Furthermore, the Superintendent of the Battleford Agency sent a copy of the Saulteaux First Nation Band Council\u2019s proposal to the Regional Supervisor for Saskatchewan on October 23, 1959, referring to it as a copy of proposals \u201cas set forth by the Saulteaux Band Council\u201d in which they set forth their terms of negotiation. It may well be that the Saskatchewan Government, having endorsed the First Nation\u2019s proposal, came to consider it as its own.\n[49] Be that as it may, a reviewing court should refrain from reweighing or reassessing the evidence, and should not interfere with the Tribunal\u2019s factual findings absent exceptional circumstances. In the case at bar, the Tribunal\u2019s findings were based on the evidence, and its interpretation of the record was not unreasonable. More importantly, it cannot convincingly be argued that the Saulteaux First Nation did not understand the terms of the surrender. In its resolution dated November 2, 1959, the Band Council states that Saskatchewan\u2019s proposal \u201chad been read and fully understood by us\u201d.\n[50] At the meeting called to vote on the proposed surrender, a Court interpreter was chosen on the recommendation of the Band Council, and the conditions of the surrender were translated and read out. As noted by the Tribunal, when asked by the Superintendent of the Battleford Agency if the terms of the surrender were understood, no questions from those in attendance were recorded. The applicant does not dispute these facts (SCT Decision at para. 108).\n[51] On the basis of the record, I am therefore of the view that the Tribunal could reasonably conclude that the Saulteaux First Nation had an adequate understanding of the surrender terms.\n[52] Finally, the Tribunal looked into the allegations of the applicant that the Crown\u2019s conduct tainted the dealings to such an extent that it made it unsafe to rely on the Band\u2019s understanding and intention. After reviewing its previous decisions on tainted dealings in Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2019 SCTC 5 (Makwa Sahgaiehcan); Doig River First Nation and Blueberry River First Nations v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2015 SCTC 6, the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Chippewas of Kettle & Stony Point v. Canada (AG), (1996) 141 D.L.R. (4th) 1, and considering the evidence relating to Saulteaux First Nation\u2019s understanding of the surrender and knowledge of leasing as an option, the Tribunal found that there were no tainted dealings.\n[53] Counsel for the applicant submits that this conclusion is unreasonable for the following reasons. It is argued that the Tribunal failed to properly take into account the advice given by the Deputy Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Canada to his counterpart as to how the Saulteaux Band could be induced to reverse its refusal to surrender any of its land, in his March 26, 1958 letter. In providing Saskatchewan with such advice, and by offering to facilitate a meeting between Saskatchewan and the Saulteaux Band, it is said that the Deputy Minister refused to recognize the autonomy of the Saulteaux Band and took a position that was not that of a neutral observer, let alone that of a fiduciary. In disregarding the substance and the weight of that March 26, 1958 letter, the Tribunal failed to acknowledge that Canada was the true architect of the 1960 surrender, and did not interpose itself between the Saulteaux Band and Saskatchewan to prevent the exploitation of one by the other as it should have done.\n[54] According to the applicant, this conduct of the Crown is compounded by the fact that it knew the Saulteaux Band was entitled to additional reserve land under the reserve clause of Treaty 6. The applicant argues that the Crown therefore stood to benefit from the surrender since the Saulteaux Band could use the funds received from Saskatchewan in exchange for part of their existing asset to purchase land, thereby absolving Canada of its treaty land entitlement obligation.\n[55] However, the insinuation that Canada\u2019s conduct was somehow motivated by a desire to fulfill an outstanding treaty land entitlement obligation at the expense of the Saulteaux Band is entirely speculative. Whether there was such an outstanding obligation has not been established, is not supported by the evidentiary record, and is not an issue in this claim.\n[56] As for the March 26, 1958 letter, it is true that the Tribunal did not specifically address its significance in its analysis. Nonetheless, I do not think that this omission is critical. After all, the Deputy Minister\u2019s letter was not an encouragement for Saskatchewan to thwart the Saulteaux Band\u2019s will or to otherwise find a way around it, but could reasonably be interpreted as a common-sense approach to find a compromise that would be agreeable to both sides. Indeed, it is not at the request of Saskatchewan that Canada eventually set in motion the necessary steps for the surrender vote, but upon the reception of the BCR and after having assessed that the transaction would benefit Saulteaux First Nation.\n[57] What is perhaps of more significance is the argument put forward by counsel for the applicant to the effect that the Tribunal unreasonably limited its analysis to whether Saulteaux First Nation\u2019s understanding of the surrender was adequate and whether the surrender was so foolish or improvident as to constitute exploitation, and failed to address the Crown\u2019s duty of full disclosure in the context of a land surrender. More precisely, the applicant submits that the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duty required it to disclose the leasing option to band membership in advance of the surrender vote. Whether that failure is analyzed through the prism of tainted dealings by the Crown, or a lack of full and informed consent by the Saulteaux First Nation, or as a breach of Canada\u2019s duty of minimal impairment, I believe this argument deserves more careful examination.\nB. Did the Specific Claims Tribunal err in determining that there was no duty of minimal impairment? [58] Counsel for the applicant claims that the Tribunal erred when it concluded that the duty of minimal impairment is inapplicable to a surrender and therefore that there was no breach of such a duty. This concept of minimal impairment emerges from the decision of the Supreme Court in Osoyoos Indian Band v. Oliver (Town), 2001 SCC 85 (Osoyoos). In that case, the highest court determined that the fiduciary duty of the Crown is not restricted in its application to cases of surrender. When, pursuant to section 35 of the Act, the Crown determines that an expropriation of reserve land is in the public interest, a fiduciary duty arises \u201cto expropriate or grant only the minimum interest required in order to fulfill that public purpose, thus ensuring a minimal impairment of the use and enjoyment of Indian lands by the band\u201d (Osoyoos at para. 52).\n[59] As the Tribunal noted, the requirement to minimally impair does not arise until the decision to expropriate has been made. This is consistent with Osoyoos, where the Supreme Court held that no fiduciary duty exists at the stage where the Crown determines whether an expropriation involving Indian lands is required. It is only at the stage when the Crown decides to take back designated reserve land for a public purpose that the requirement to minimally impair arises. This is justified by the fact that the purpose and means by which the reserve land is transacted are different in the contexts of an expropriation and of a surrender. In the first case, the Crown makes a unilateral decision, whereas the First Nation makes an autonomous decision in a surrender. This is why the obligation to ensure consent in a surrender is replaced by an obligation to minimally impair the protected interest in an expropriation. That distinction has been made quite explicit in Southwind, where the Supreme Court clarified that \u201c[i]n an expropriation, the obligation to ensure consent is replaced by an obligation to minimally impair the protected interest\u201d (at para. 64).\n[60] However, this is not the end of the matter. In supplemental submissions filed with the Court\u2019s permission to address the decision released on January 12, 2024 in Kahkewistahaw, counsel for the applicant argued that the Tribunal made the same mistake that was corrected in that case in failing to acknowledge the Crown\u2019s multifaceted fiduciary duties. Writing for the Court, Gleason J.A. made it clear that the fiduciary duty owed by the Crown to Indigenous peoples in the context of a surrender goes beyond the obligation to ensure that the First Nation has consented and that the bargain is not improvident. As was stated in Southwind, the fiduciary duty also imposes on the Crown obligations of loyalty, good faith, full disclosure, and management of the process to advance the best interests of the First Nation. As she added, the context may sometimes require the Crown to go beyond the terms found in the surrender document and to make sure that the First Nation knows of other available choices:\nWhere there is a failure to disclose relevant facts, any consent given to the surrender is not an informed one, and therefore cannot be valid. This is because \u201cwhere actions are a matter of choice, the exercise of an actor\u2019s autonomous will depend on the actor\u2019s knowledge of the available choices\u201d\nKahkewistahaw at para. 81, citing Makwa Sahgaiehcan at para. 149.\n[61] On the basis of these comments, which I fully endorse, the applicant claims that the Tribunal failed to address the Crown\u2019s duty of full disclosure, and did not disclose the leasing option to band membership in advance of the surrender vote. Indeed, the applicant submits that Canada had already prepared surrender documents for lease, pursuant to the previously stated desires of the community, but subsequently withheld them in favour of the absolute surrender for sale to Saskatchewan. As a result, contends the applicant, the relative merits of leasing as opposed to selling was not discussed, full disclosure was not made, and Saulteaux First Nation\u2019s consent was not informed.\n[62] In my view, this argument is untenable. The context in Kahkewistahaw leading the Court to determine that the consent given to the surrender by the First Nation was not an informed one was different from the circumstances surrounding the surrender vote in the present case. In Kahkewistahaw, the only evidence that the First Nation understood that leasing was an option was contained in a letter from an agent of the Indian Affairs Branch. Furthermore, an exchange of letters between two senior officials shortly after the surrender took place revealed that the value of the surrendered land was expected to increase significantly since there would be a greater demand for cottage lots in the near future, and that even greater returns could be expected if the land was subdivided and leased for cottage sites. Yet, the Tribunal dismissed that correspondence as being merely the views of two individuals which bore no relevance to the adequacy of the First Nation\u2019s understanding of the terms of the surrender. Finally, the evidence also revealed that the balance in Kahkewistahaw First Nation\u2019s capital account far exceeded the cost of purchasing an equivalent amount of alternate land, which was part of the rationale for surrendering the reserve lands in the first place.\n[63] In the case at bar, there is no such misapprehension of the evidence indicating that the Department of Indian Affairs withheld facts or information that would have been relevant to Saulteaux First Nation\u2019s decision to surrender its lands, or that would undermine its consent. A careful reading of the record shows that Saulteaux First Nation knew, at all material times before the 1960 surrender vote, that it could lease rather than sell its lands. Indeed, objections to the surrender of all of Jackfish Lake waterfront reserve land had been expressed more than once, and the majority of voting members continued to favour leasing the land at a Band meeting held August 7, 1959, just a few months before the surrender vote was held on January 25, 1960.\n[64] It is true that Canada had already prepared surrender documents for lease, pursuant to the previously stated desires of the community, but subsequently withheld them in favour of the absolute surrender for sale to Saskatchewan. But as pointed out by the Tribunal, Canada took that course of action because it believed that the Saulteaux First Nation was no longer interested in leasing. In those circumstances, and in the context of the entire record, the Tribunal could reasonably conclude that Canada did not conceal a surrender for lease option in favour of an absolute surrender. After all, Canada presented the second proposal for a vote at the request of the Band Council.\n[65] Consequently, it would be specious to argue that Canada breached its fiduciary duty by not disclosing the leasing option to band membership in advance of the surrender. It was a safe assumption for the Tribunal to conclude that Band members were well aware of the leasing option when they attended the January 25, 1960 meeting. As the Tribunal stated, in a key passage of its decision:\nConsidering their opinion expressed in August 1959, the voting members of the Saulteaux First Nation understood that leasing a smaller portion of IR 159 for summer resort purposes was an option when they attended the January 26, 1960 meeting for the purpose of taking a vote on the proposed surrender of the 207 acres of IR 159. It was within their right to express their preference to do so by voting against the surrender proposal. A majority of the members had expressed their objection to selling the 207 acres in the past. For the first time, however, they were asked to vote on the sale with conditions designed by their Council. Of the 60 voting members, 52 voted in favour of approving the surrender proposal as presented. The evidentiary record does not therefore support a finding that presenting a vote only on the proposed surrender of the 207 acres of IR 159 vitiated the free and informed consent of the members.\nSCT Decision at para. 125.\n[66] The applicant has failed to establish that the Tribunal came to an unreasonable conclusion. It thoroughly reviewed the evidence, applied the relevant legal principles, and found in a well-articulated and intelligible decision that Canada satisfied its duties of loyalty, good faith, and full disclosure prior to the surrender.\n[67] Could the Crown have gone further, as suggested by the applicant, and discussed the relative merits of leasing as opposed to selling prior to the vote? Possibly. But we must pay heed to McLachlin J.\u2019s admonition in Blueberry that the Act \u201cstrikes a balance between the two extremes of autonomy and protection\u201d (at para. 35). The fiduciary duty of the Crown is not meant to substitute the Crown\u2019s will for that of the First Nations. The decision of the Crown to refuse its consent to a surrender must be exercised with caution, and with a view to preventing exploitative bargains. When, as here, the Crown is of the view that the surrender is not prejudicial to the interests of the First Nation, and the record shows that its voting members fully understand the terms of the bargain, are aware of alternative options, and had an opportunity to ask questions before voting, it is reasonable to conclude that the Crown has fulfilled its fiduciary duty. To ask for more from the Crown would tip the balance and risk returning us to an era when First Nations were treated in a paternalistic way.\n[68] For all of the above reasons, I therefore find that the Tribunal\u2019s decision falls within the range of reasonable outcomes based on the applicable law and the facts that were before it, and does not warrant our intervention.\nC. Did the Specific Claims Tribunal breach the principles of procedural fairness? [69] The applicant alleges that the Tribunal created confusion by changing the wording of the issues and the manner in which they would be presented at the hearing after it had filed its memorandum of fact and law. It claims that following the filing of the parties\u2019 memoranda of fact and law, the Tribunal advised the parties that it wished to hear final submissions within the framework of a different sequence of questions than that devised in a prior direction that predated the filing of the applicant\u2019s memorandum. Following a case management conference, however, the Tribunal agreed to leave the questions as originally set out. The applicant nevertheless contends that it was prejudiced by the confusion created by the Tribunal.\n[70] In my view, the applicant\u2019s assertion, which amounts to an allegation of procedural unfairness, is without merit. First, it would appear that the applicant was successful in convincing the Tribunal not to change the hearing format and the sequence of questions. Second, the applicant did not raise its allegation of procedural unfairness at the earliest opportunity. While it opposed the restatement of the issues proposed by the respondent, it did so on the basis that it would not have time to reorganize its oral submissions to fit in the new parameters, not on the basis of confusion or of a breach of procedural fairness.\n[71] In any event, the issues set out in the Agreed Statement of Issues, the April 19, 2022 Direction and the email sent to the parties by the Tribunal on May 30, 2022 in anticipation of the case management conference, were all substantially the same. The differences were minor, and the applicant has not substantiated how they could have created confusion.\n[72] Finally, the parties each had a meaningful opportunity to present their cases fully and fairly. In its June 2, 2022 Endorsement, the Tribunal clearly set out how oral submissions would proceed, and showed flexibility in the way each party could present their case. The Tribunal stated explicitly that the hearing would proceed on the basis of questions as originally set out in its April 19, 2022 Direction, and added that it would afford the parties \u201clatitude to discuss some topics in the order they believe is necessary to put forward their argument in the best way possible\u201d. In those circumstances, I am unable to find any breach of procedural fairness.\nV.

Introduction [1] This is an appeal pursuant to subsection 68(1) of the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1, 2nd Supp. (Customs Act), from a decision of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the Tribunal) issued on May 17, 2022 (AP-2021-008) (the Decision), in which the Tribunal found that the goods in issue, Charoen Pokphand Authentic Asia\u2122 Hand-Wrapped Shrimp Wonton Soups, were properly classified as \u201cstuffed pasta, whether or not cooked or otherwise prepared\u201d in accordance with tariff item No. 1902.20.00 of the Schedule to the Customs Tariff, S.C. 1997, c. 36 (the Act).\n[2] More particularly, the goods in issue are described as being a package of six frozen, sealed containers of 145 grams each. Each container consists of five wontons, stuffed with cooked shrimp, which are placed in a block of frozen liquid soup concentrate (Decision at para. 5). The goods require the addition of water and subsequent heating in order to be ready for consumption.\n[3] Before this Court, Charoen Pokphand Foods Canada Inc. (the appellant), contends that the Tribunal committed numerous errors of law and that had these errors not been committed, the Tribunal would have classified the goods in issue under tariff item No. 2104.10.00 as \u201csoups and broths and preparations therefor.\u201d\n[4] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal and maintain the Tribunal\u2019s classification.\nII. The CITT Decision [5] The Tribunal, applying Rule 1 of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System (the Rules) found in the Schedule to the Act, began its analysis with heading 21.04 (soups and broths and preparations therefor) as per exclusion (b) contained in the Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Explanatory Notes) to heading 19.02 (Decision at paras 36\u201337). After examining the Explanatory Notes to heading 21.04, the Tribunal concluded that the goods in issue could not be classified under heading 21.04 as (i) they required the addition of water before consumption, meaning they could not be classified as \u201csoups\u2026ready for consumption after heating\u201d under subcategory (2) of the Explanatory Notes (Decision at para. 41) and (ii) they did not meet the definition of \u201cpreparations for soups\u201d under subcategory (1) of the Explanatory Notes since the wontons are a \u201cdistinct component\u201d and are not blended with the frozen soup concentrate (Decision at paras 43\u201344).\n[6] As part of its analysis, the Tribunal noted that the World Customs Organization (WCO) Harmonized System (HS) Committee reached a similar conclusion in regard to identical goods, which led to the adoption of the following WCO Classification Opinion for subheading 1902.20: \u201c[p]reparation consisting of pasta stuffed with shrimps (wontons) and soup concentrate. The preparation is frozen and put up in a plastic bowl for retail sale. Before consumption, after adding water, it has to be re-heated in a microwave oven\u201d (Decision at paras 47\u201356).\n[7] The Tribunal nonetheless proceeded with its own analysis, as it did not subscribe to the HC Committee\u2019s application of Rules 1 and 6. Having established that Rule 1 alone did not permit the classification of the goods in issue, and that Rules 2(a), 2(b) and 3(a) were inapplicable or non-determinative, the Tribunal went on to consider Rule 3(b) (Decision at paras 74\u201379). Given that the goods in issue consisted of two separate components, the soup concentrate and the wontons, the Tribunal proceeded to an analysis of the goods\u2019 essential character. In light of the fact that the wontons formed a larger proportion of the goods in issue (by bulk, quantity, weight and value), the Tribunal concluded that the \u201cstuffed pasta\u201d component dictated the goods\u2019 essential character (Decision at paras 80\u201384). Particularly, it noted that the soup concentrate portion of the goods was \u201cmainly a medium facilitating the preparation of the wontons prior to consumption\u201d (Decision at para. 82).\n[8] Consequently, the Tribunal classified the goods in issue as \u201cstuffed pasta, whether or not cooked or otherwise prepared\u201d in accordance with tariff item No. 1902.20.00 of the Schedule to the Act.\nIII. Standard of Review [9] It is trite law that pursuant to subsection 68(1) of the Customs Act, this Court can only examine questions of law on appeal from a decision of the Tribunal (see Canada (Attorney General) v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.), Inc., 2023 FCA 209 at para. 24; Canada (Attorney General) v. Impex Solutions Inc., 2020 FCA 171 at paras 29\u201331 (Impex); Keurig Canada Inc. v. Canada (Border Services Agency), 2022 FCA 100 at paras 15\u201316 (Keurig)). Accordingly, the correctness standard articulated in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, applies.\nIV. Analysis [10] The appellant alleges that the Tribunal made a number of errors and frames the issues as raising questions of law (Appellant\u2019s Memorandum of Fact and Law at para. 30). However, I am of the view that the appellant has failed to raise any errors of law. Indeed, the issues raised by the appellant are questions of fact or mixed fact and law from which no legal question can be extricated, and are therefore not captured by the right of appeal contained in subsection 68(1) of the Customs Act.\n[11] Also, the issues as raised and argued by the parties in their written and oral submissions, are intertwined and repetitive. For the sake of clarity, they are best framed as follows: (1) did the Tribunal err in law in its analytical approach to the Rules; (2) did the Tribunal err in law in its analysis of the \u201cessential character\u201d of the goods in issue; and (3) did the Tribunal err in law in its consideration of the expert evidence?\n[12] The first issue raised by the appellant relates to the analytical framework applied by the Tribunal, i.e. its application of the Rules. The appellant argues that the Tribunal erred by finding that Rule 1 was insufficient to dispose of the classification and, in the alternative, that the Tribunal erred in law by refusing to apply Rule 2(a) to classify the goods in issue.\n[13] It is recalled that the Rules have been described as a hierarchy, meaning that Rule 1 is paramount and that subsequent Rules are only applied if the application of a previous Rule is inconclusive (Canada (Attorney General) v. Igloo Vikski Inc., 2016 SCC 38, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 80 at paras 7, 29).\n[14] In the appellant\u2019s view, Rule 1, if properly applied, would have been sufficient to dispose of the classification of the goods in issue. During the hearing, the appellant strongly urged the Court to find that the goods in issue were \u201csoup\u201d or \u201cpreparations therefor\u201d and, as such, should be classified under heading 21.04. However, the Tribunal found that the goods in issue could not, as a whole, be classified solely with reference to Rule 1, as the distinct components of the goods in issue were prima facie classifiable under different headings, i.e. heading 19.02 (pasta, whether or not cooked or stuffed (with meat or other substances) or otherwise prepared) and heading 21.04 (soups and broths and preparations therefor) (Decision at para. 65). Specifically, the appellant challenges the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the goods in issue do not constitute \u201cpreparations therefor\u201d within the meaning of heading 21.04 and alleges that the Tribunal erred in law by not distinguishing Anderson Watts Ltd., 2019 CanLII 110939 (AP-2018-003) (Anderson Watts), a decision involving the interpretation of the term \u201cpreparations therefor\u201d in the context of goods such as \u201cInstant Noodles\u201d and \u201cNoodles in a Cup\u201d. In Anderson Watts, the Tribunal held that goods consisting of \u201cmultiple edible components intended to be used and packaged together\u201d (in that case, powdered soup base and dry instant noodles) do not constitute preparations within the meaning of heading 21.04 due to their non-blended nature (Anderson Watts at paras 40\u201342).\n[15] Although the interpretation of provisions of the Schedule to the Act can be a question of law (Impex at paras 29\u201342), \u201cthe actual application of the provisions to a set of facts is more likely to be a matter of mixed fact and law\u201d (Canada (Attorney General) v. Best Buy Canada Ltd., 2021 FCA 161 at para. 24 (dissenting reasons with no disagreement from the majority on that point) (Best Buy)). Here, the appellant is taking issue with the Tribunal\u2019s application of the analytical framework and the Anderson Watts decision. Contrary to what the appellant alleges, the Tribunal\u2019s determination that the goods were not classifiable pursuant to Rule 1 is a question of mixed fact and law. The Tribunal clearly identified and followed the applicable framework for Rule 1 (Decision at paras 24, 38\u201346). Further, the Tribunal was entitled to consider and rely on its precedent in Anderson Watts. More importantly, the appellant is disagreeing with the evidentiary finding of the Tribunal that \u201cthe wontons remain a distinct component and do not form part of the frozen soup concentrate\u201d and \u201c[t]he wontons are not \u2018blended\u2019 into the soup concentrate\u201d (Decision at para. 44). In doing so, the appellant is urging this Court to reassess and reweigh the evidence. This is not our role.\n[16] Still, under the Tribunal\u2019s Rule 1 analysis, the appellant alleges that the Tribunal incorrectly applied the Explanatory Note to heading 21.04. The Explanatory Notes provide for two subcategories of \u201csoups, broths and preparations therefor\u201d: 1) \u201cpreparations for soups or broths requiring only the addition of water, milk, etc.\u201d and 2) \u201csoups and broths ready for consumption after heating.\u201d As indicated above, the Tribunal made a finding that the goods in issue did not fall within either subcategory. The appellant contends that the Tribunal should have found that the goods in issue could fit within the first subcategory, and alternatively, disagrees with the Tribunal\u2019s treatment of the subcategories as exhaustive rather than inclusive. The appellant is in disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s finding and I remain unconvinced by the appellant\u2019s arguments that the Tribunal erred in law in its determination.\n[17] In the alternative to its Rule 1 arguments, the appellant also challenges the Tribunal\u2019s finding that Rule 2(a) does not assist in the classification of the goods. Rule 2(a) applies to unfinished goods. The Tribunal made a factual finding that the goods in issue are \u201cimported\u2026 ready for retail sale\u201d (Decision at para. 76). The Court cannot interfere with this finding on appeal. Further, I note that pursuant to Explanatory Note III on incomplete or unfinished articles, Rule 2(a) will generally not apply to Section IV goods, such as the goods in issue (Respondent\u2019s Memorandum of Fact and Law at para. 29).\n[18] The second issue raised by the appellant relates to the application of Rule 3(b) and the method used by the Tribunal to determine the \u201cessential character\u201d of the goods in issue. Rule 3(b) provides that goods made up of two different components are classified under the tariff of the component that gives them their essential character. Essentially, the appellant disputes the fact that the Tribunal placed greater emphasis on the relative weight of the goods\u2019 components, i.e. wontons and soup concentrate, as opposed to the marketing and advertising of the goods in issue to determine their essential character. In other words, the appellant seems to imply that the marketing of the goods as a \u201csoup\u201d is determinative to the Tribunal\u2019s determination of essential character.\n[19] I disagree.\n[20] The essential character of a good is always assessed on a case-by-case basis (Explanatory Note VIII to Rule 3(b)). The determination requires the assessment and weighing of evidence, a question heavily infused with factual determinations. For instance, in this case, the expert evidence before the Tribunal demonstrated that the goods in issue contain 76 percent shrimp wontons and 24 percent soup concentrate by weight, whereas the product labelling and literature demonstrated that the goods contain 55 to 60 percent shrimp wontons and 40 to 55 percent soup concentrate (Decision at para. 81). The Tribunal concluded, after considering the relative weight and other factors (Decision at para. 83), that the essential character of the goods in issue was imparted by the stuffed pasta component (Heading 19.02). Absent an egregiously incorrect and unsupported finding of fact, our Court cannot review factual findings in the context of an appeal pursuant to subsection 68(1) of the Customs Act (see Keurig at paras 17\u201319; Best Buy at para. 25; Canada (Border Services Agency) v. Danson D\u00e9cor Inc., 2022 FCA 205 at para. 26).\n[21] The final issue raised by the appellant concerns the Tribunal\u2019s failure to give proper regard to the testimony of the respondent\u2019s expert witness who provided some evidence that the goods in issue were advertised and sold as soup. The appellant alleges that this evidence was compelling enough for the Tribunal to depart from the WCO Classification Opinion with which it agreed in result only. However, the Tribunal was clear that \u201cthe evidence on file does not provide any \u2018sound reason\u2019 to justify diverging from the HS Committee\u2019s ultimate classification\u201d (Decision at para. 72). Our intervention is not warranted.\n[22] I would dismiss the appeal with costs and I would amend the style of cause in the manner the respondent requested. The style of cause on this document and on the judgment of this Court in file A-165-22 reflect the amendment.\n\"Richard Boivin\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nJudith Woods J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nMonica Biringer J.A.\u201d\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDocket:\nA-165-22\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nCHAROEN POKPHAND FOODS CANADA INC. v.

Specifically, the General Division found that the appellant had wilfully failed to comply with the COVID-19 vaccination requirements at his workplace, Lakeridge Health.\n[3] In an appeal from a decision on an application for judicial review, this Court must determine whether the Federal Court correctly selected and applied the standard of review: Northern Regional Health Authority v. Horrocks, 2021 SCC 42 at para. 10; Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36 at para. 45. In effect, this Court must step into the shoes of the Federal Court and review afresh the Appeal Division\u2019s decision to deny leave to appeal: Horrocks at para. 10.\n[4] In our view, the Federal Court correctly selected the reasonableness standard of review: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at para. 16; Kuk v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 74 at para. 5; Bhamra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 121 at para. 3. It also correctly applied that standard, finding the Appeal Division\u2019s decision to be reasonable.\n[5] The Appeal Division correctly identified the limited basis on which leave to appeal may be granted \u2014 if the proposed appeal has a \u201creasonable chance of success\u201d based on at least one of the grounds set out in subsection 58(1) of the Department of Economic and Social Development Act, S.C. 2005, c. 34 (DESDA). These are: a failure to observe a principle of natural justice, an error in law, and an erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner.\n[6] The Appeal Division reviewed the General Division\u2019s key findings. The General Division found that the appellant had been suspended and later terminated because he failed to comply with Directive 6, which Lakeridge Health had implemented, as they were required (General Division Decision at para. 46). We disagree with the appellant\u2019s submission that there was no policy. Lakeridge employees were required to provide proof of full vaccination against COVID-19, submit to regular antigen testing and provide verification of negative test results or obtain an exemption. The appellant chose none of these options.\n[7] The General Division also found that the appellant was aware that his non-compliance with Directive 6 would lead to discipline, including termination.\n[8] The General Division was satisfied that the appellant lost his job because of misconduct within the meaning of subsection 30(1) of the Employment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996, c. 23 and the case law (Mishibinijima v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 36 at para. 14) and accordingly the appellant was not entitled to receive employment insurance benefits.\n[9] Finding no reviewable error in these determinations, based on the limited grounds in subsection 58(1) of the DESDA, that would give an appeal a reasonable chance of success, the Appeal Division denied leave to appeal.\n[10] We agree with the Federal Court that the Appeal Division\u2019s decision was reasonable. The reasons provide an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis that is justified in relation to the factual and legal constraints: Vavilov at para. 85. The reasons refer to the well-established test for misconduct and explain why the appellant had not identified a reviewable error in the General Division\u2019s application of that test to the facts. The Appeal Division\u2019s decision is also consistent with many recent decisions of this Court in similar circumstances: Kuk at para. 9, and the decisions referred to therein; see also Palozzi v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 81.\n[11] The appellant did not establish at the Federal Court and has not established in this Court that the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is unreasonable.\n[12] We also do not accept the appellant\u2019s submission that there was procedural unfairness. There is no indication that the appellant did not know the case to meet or have a full and fair chance to respond: Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 at para. 56.\n[13] For these reasons, we will dismiss the appeal. Given the circumstances of this case, there will be no award of costs.\n\u201cMonica Biringer\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-58-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nANTHONY CECCHETTO v.

Background [1] This decision concerns two matters that have arisen since the dismissal of the present appeal. The first concerns costs of the appeal. The second concerns a motion by the appellant, Leonard B. French, to stay this Court\u2019s decision pending a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) on an application by Mr. French for leave to appeal this Court\u2019s decision.\n[2] In respect of costs, this Court\u2019s judgment dismissing the appeal invited the parties to make submissions in accordance with a timetable. The respondent, the Royal Canadian Legion (Dominion Command) (the Legion), provided timely submissions. Mr. French did not, and the deadline for doing so expired on April 26, 2024. Therefore, the matter of costs has been ready for this Court\u2019s consideration since that time.\n[3] Mr. French served and filed his stay motion on May 7, 2024. It is possible that one purpose of Mr. French\u2019s motion was to delay this Court\u2019s decision on costs. However, I would not delay a decision on costs for three reasons. First, Mr. French did not mention delaying a decision on costs in his motion. Second, Mr. French did not file his motion until 11 days after the deadline for his costs submissions had passed. Third, as discussed below, I am not convinced that Mr. French has satisfied the criteria to stay an award of costs pending a decision on an application for leave to appeal to the SCC.\n[4] The Legion provided submissions in response to Mr. French\u2019s motion on the same day the motion was filed (May 7, 2024). Mr. French did not file any submissions in reply to the Legion\u2019s, and the deadline for doing so expired on May 13, 2024. Therefore, the stay motion has been ready for this Court\u2019s consideration since that time.\nII. Costs [5] The Legion claims $8644.50 in costs. This is based on a bill of costs comprising the following six items: (i) preparation of the appeal book, (ii) memorandum of fact and law, (iii) counsel fee for a September 2023 motion, (iv) counsel fee for the appeal hearing, (v) counsel fee for second counsel at the appeal hearing, and (vi) preparing costs submission. The Legion calculates costs based on the middle of Column III of Tariff B of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106. It also doubles the costs in view of Rule 420(2)(b) and a settlement offer it made that Mr. French rejected.\n[6] I would adjust the Legion\u2019s calculation of costs in the following ways. First, I would calculate costs based not on the middle of Column III but rather on the bottom of column I as did the Federal Court. Second, I would not award costs for the attendance of second counsel at the hearing of the appeal. In my view, the complexity of the issues in the appeal was not so great as to justify such costs. Third, I would not double the costs award in view of the Legion\u2019s settlement offer.\n[7] With regard to the settlement offer, I recognize that the Legion\u2019s offer to forego costs could amount to a compromise sufficient to meet the requirements of Rule 420. However, I also recognize that the Legion\u2019s settlement offer in this case amounted to little more than an offer to accept Mr. French\u2019s capitulation. Moreover, I take into account that, as indicated in this Court\u2019s decision on the merits of this appeal (2024 FCA 63), the Legion did not respond to Mr. French\u2019s key argument in the appeal (see paragraphs 22 and following). This Court dealt with that argument without much assistance from the Legion. In the circumstances of this case, I would exercise this Court\u2019s discretion not to apply Rule 420.\n[8] By my calculation, costs awarded as described above would amount to seven units. At $180 per unit, and 13% HST added, I would order that Mr. French pay the Legion\u2019s costs of the appeal in the amount of $1423.80, all-inclusive.\nIII. Motion for Stay [9] The practical goal of Mr. French\u2019s motion is difficult to understand. As indicated above, he seeks a stay of this Court\u2019s decision pending leave to appeal to the SCC. I acknowledge the power of this Court, or a judge of this Court, to grant such a stay pursuant to subsection 65.1(2) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26. However, it is not clear what step or action Mr. French seeks to stay. The Federal Court simply dismissed his action against the Legion with costs. This Court in turn simply dismissed Mr. French\u2019s appeal of the Federal Court\u2019s decision, with a decision on costs to follow. Mr. French may make an application for leave to appeal this Court\u2019s decision to the SCC in accordance with the Supreme Court Act, and his right to do so, and to benefit from a successful appeal of this Court\u2019s decision, does not appear to depend on obtaining a stay of that decision.\n[10] I note that this Court\u2019s power to grant the requested stay requires a finding that a delay in obtaining a stay \u201cwould result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d While Mr. French argues that this Court\u2019s decision on the appeal contains several errors, he does not explain what miscarriage of justice will result from denying a stay at this time.\n[11] Mr. French must also convince this Court that his motion meets the requirements of the tripartite test set out in RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 1994 CanLII 117 (S.C.C.), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311 at p. 334. I need not discuss all of the requirements of this test. It is sufficient to note that I am not convinced that Mr. French will suffer any irreparable harm if no stay is granted, even if costs are awarded prior to a decision on an application for leave to appeal to the SCC: Mr. French has not made any submissions to the contrary.\n[12] I would dismiss Mr. French\u2019s motion for a stay with additional costs in the all-inclusive amount of $200.\n\"George R.

Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 528) dismissing her application for judicial review of a final level grievance decision of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) (the CBSA grievance decision). The Federal Court determined that the CBSA grievance decision was reasonable and that the appellant had not been deprived of procedural fairness in the underlying harassment investigation or grievance process.\n[2] In an appeal to this Court of a Federal Court decision on judicial review, we are required to determine whether the Federal Court: (i) selected the appropriate standard of review; and (ii) if so, correctly applied that standard: Northern Regional Health Authority v. Horrocks, 2021 SCC 42, 462 D.L.R. (4th) 585 at para. 10; Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 SCR 559 at paras. 45-47. In this second regard, we essentially step into the shoes of the Federal Court and consider the administrative decision at issue, here the CBSA grievance decision.\n[3] The Federal Court correctly identified reasonableness as the standard to be applied to the merits or substance of the CBSA grievance decision. The Court also correctly found that the procedural fairness issues raised by the appellant required the Court to determine whether the CBSA\u2019s procedure was fair having regard to all the circumstances.\n[4] The Federal Court determined that the reasons for the CBSA grievance decision are set out in the decision itself, the two investigation reports (the Investigation Reports), and the final level grievance pr\u00e9cis prepared by a senior labour relations advisor (the Advisor) (the Pr\u00e9cis). We agree: Sketchley v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 404, [2006] 3 FCR 392 at paras. 37-39; Veillette v. Canada (Revenue Agency), 2020 FC 544 at para. 27. This finding is important as it addresses the appellant\u2019s submission that the CBSA grievance decision provides insufficient reasons to justify its conclusions. We are of the view that the CBSA\u2019s decision, read with the Investigation Reports and the Pr\u00e9cis, and considered in light of the record, discloses the key bases on which the decision was made.\n[5] The appellant maintains her argument that she was not afforded procedural fairness during the harassment complaint and grievance processes. With respect, we disagree. We find that the record reveals that the complaint and grievance processes were participatory, open and fair. The appellant knew the case she had to meet and had full opportunity to present her position to the investigator and the Advisor.\n[6] We have carefully reviewed the record and the appellant\u2019s arguments. While we do not endorse all of the reasons given by the Federal Court, we see no error in its decision that warrants our intervention. We conclude that the CBSA\u2019s grievance decision is justified and reasonable and that the appellant has not established any breach of her right to procedural fairness.\n[7] Accordingly, this appeal will be dismissed without costs, none having been sought by the respondent.\n\u201cElizabeth Walker\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-133-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nVALERIE ANDRUSZKIEWICZ v.

Canada, 2023 FC 252, 2023 A.C.W.S. 557 (per Fothergill J.).\n[2] In that judgment, the Federal Court struck the claims of those plaintiffs that it found were subject to section 236 of the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 2 [FPSLRA]. The Federal Court did not grant these plaintiffs leave to amend their claims. The plaintiffs whose claims were struck in their entirety without leave to amend were those who were members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the RCMP) or who were employed in the other federal departments, agencies or other portions of the public service listed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons. In the judgment under appeal, the Federal Court also struck the claims of all the other plaintiffs who were employed by other organizations, but for this group granted leave to amend their claims. The Federal Court awarded the defendants costs, fixed in the amount of $5,000.00, payable forthwith and in any event of the cause.\n[3] For the reasons that follow, I would grant this appeal in part. I would set aside the judgment of the Federal Court and would amend it to provide all of the plaintiffs leave to amend the Statement of Claim in accordance with these reasons. Because success is divided, I would grant no costs in this appeal and would set aside the Federal Court\u2019s costs award.\nI. The Statement of Claim [4] I commence by reviewing the nature of the claims made in the plaintiffs\u2019 Statement of Claim. While it is difficult to discern precisely what is being claimed given the way the Statement of Claim was drafted, it seems to me that, when fairly read in its entirety, the Statement of Claim advances two sorts of claims on behalf of all of the plaintiffs.\n[5] First, the Statement of Claim alleges that the employer policies\u2014which mandated that the plaintiffs must be vaccinated against COVID-19, failing which they would be placed on leave without pay or be subject to having their employment terminated\u2014violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11 [Charter], or otherwise gave rise to several claims. The employer policies at issue in this case are the Policy on COVID-19 Vaccination for the Core Public Administration Including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, issued by the Treasury Board (the TB Policy), and similar policies issued by other federally-regulated employers who employed some of the plaintiffs. Among other things, the Statement of Claim alleges that the respondents are liable for these other employers adopting policies similar to the TB Policy. The bulk of the Statement of Claim is directed towards these employment-related vaccination policies, which the plaintiffs allege caused them harm and damages because they chose to decline to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n[6] Second, the Statement of Claim alleges that the limitations imposed by the Interim Order Respecting Certain Requirements for Civil Aviation Due to COVID-19, No. 61, issued by Transport Canada on April 24, 2022 (the Interim Order), violated the Charter rights of all of the plaintiffs and gave rise to a host of other claims. Because the plaintiffs chose not to be vaccinated against COVID-19, they claim they were prevented from travelling by airplane by the Interim Order. The plaintiffs also challenge comparable measures that were applicable to train travel and travel by water for similar reasons.\n[7] That the latter types of claims, regarding travel impediments, were advanced on behalf of all plaintiffs appears, in particular, from paragraphs 1(f), 12, 30, 67 and 69 of the Statement of Claim. They read as follows:\nl. The Plaintiffs claim:\n\u2026\n(f) a further declaration that Interim Order Respecting Certain Requirements for Civil Aviation Due to Covid-19, No.61, requiring covid \u201cvaccination\u201d and masking on planes, trains and boats is unconstitutional and of no force and effect in that:\n(i) There is no jurisdiction under s.91 of the Constitution Act, 1867 to decree any medical treatment whatsoever as this lies, subject to constitutional restraint(s), within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Provinces;\n(ii) That any purported or pretended power, under the emergency branch of P.O.G.G (Peace, Order and and Good Government) can only be done by Legislation, with the invocation, subject to constitutional constraints, of the Emergencies Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. 22 (4th Supp.));\n(iii) That the Regulations and Executive decrees mandating such \u201cvaccine mandates\u201d are improper delegation, and constitute \u201cdangling\u201d Regulations, not tied to any Act of Parliament;\n(iv) That in any event, any purported mandatory, or coerced de facto mandatory vaccine mandates violate ss. 2. 6, 7, and 15 of the Charter, as enunciated, inter alia, by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Fleming v. Reid (1991) 4 O.R. (3d) 74 and in the Supreme Court of Canada in Morgentaler (1988), Rodriguez (1993) and Rasouli (2013), and Carter (2005);\n(v) That any purported mandatory, or coerced de facto mandatory vaccines violate ss.2 and ss 7 of the Charter, as enunciated, inter alia, by the Ontario Court of Charter Appeal in Fleming v. Reid, and the Supreme Court of Canada in inter alia, Morgentaler (1988), Rodriguez (1993, and Carter (2005) violate international treaty norms which constitute minimal protections to be read into s. 7 of the Charter as ruled, inter alia, by the Supreme Court of Canada in Hape, and the Federal Court of Appeal in De Guzman;\n(vi) There is no jurisdiction under s.91 of the Constitution Act, 1867 to decree any medical treatment whatsoever as this lies, subject to constitutional restraint(s), within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Provinces;\n(vii) The Pre-Charter constitutional rights to freedom of conscience and religion as pronounced by the Supreme Court of Canada in, inter alia, Switzman v Elbing and A.G. of Quebec, [1957] SCR 285 and Saumur v City of Quebec, 2 S.C.R. 299;\n(viii) violates the rights, under s.2 of the Charter, as well as s.1 under the Canadian Bill of Rights (1960) to freedom of conscience, belief, and religion;\n(ix) violates s.7 of the Charter in violating the right to bodily and psychological integrity, as manifested in the constitutionally protected right to informed, voluntary, consent to any medical treatment and procedure. as well as violating international treaty rights, protecting the same right(s) which protections must be read in as minimal protection under s. 7 of the Charter in accordance with, inter alia, Hape (SCC) and De Guzman (FCA);\n(x) violating ss.6 and 7 of the Charter;\n(xi) violating s.9 of the Charter;\n(xii) violating the pre-Charter recognized rights on \u201cthe liberty of the subject\u201d remedied by way of habeas corpus.\n\u2026\n12. All of the Plaintiffs wish to exercise their ss. 6 and 7 of the Charter rights to travel within Canada, as well as abroad, which is barred to them by virtue of a non- possession of a \u201cvaccine passport\u201d.\n\u2026\n30. All of the Plaintiffs wish to exercise their ss. 6 and 7 of the Charter rights to travel within Canada, as well as abroad, which is barred to them by virtue of a non- possession of a \u201cvaccine passport\u201d, notwithstanding that airlines and foreign countries of destination do not require nor do the airlines.\n\u2026\n67. The Plaintiffs further state that \u201cvaccine passports\u201d further violate their explicit right(s) under s.6 and 7 of the Charter granting them mobility of travel, domestically and internationally, which violations are arbitrary (contrary to s. 7), irrational, and disproportionate, and thus fail any s. l fundamental justice, or s.1 Charter analysis, in that:\n(a) The Defendants admit, in their public statements, and scientific data, and science confirms, that transmission of the virus as between the vaccinated-to-vaccinated and vaccinated-to-unvaccinated, and vice versa, is NOT prevented by the COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d (inoculations);\n(b) That there is NO rational connection between being unvaccinated and higher risks of transmission;\n(c) That the punitive bar to travel and board plains, trains, and boats is simply an irrational, arbitrary, over-reaching punitive dispensation of Charter violations and part of the malicious \u201cconsequences\u201d of simply NOT \u201cvaccinating\u201d.\n\u2026\n69. The Plaintiffs state, and the fact is, that as a result of the \u201cvaccine passports\u201d, and the removal of their mobility rights, the Plaintiffs have suffered, and will continue to suffer damages, which include, but are not restricted to:\n(a) An inability to travel to visit family, which family relationships, particularly between parent and child are constitutionally protected under s. 7 of the Charter as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada;\n(b) That this restriction under Interim Order Respecting Certain Requirements for Civil Aviation Due to Covid-19, No.61, from visiting family creates mental anguish and distress when that travel to visit family includes members facing death, medical conditions, funerals, (particularly when attendance is religiously required), weddings, confirmations, bar mitzvahs, etc;\n(c) An inability to vacation which is essential to recouping physical and psychological rest and integrity, which physical and psychological integrity is protected under s. 7 of the Charter;\n(d) Travel to attend specialized medical treatment not available locally;\n(e) Restrictions to obtaining domestic medical treatment in hospital for lack of a \u201cvaccine passport\u201d;\n(f) Prohibitions against entering domestic hospitals:\n(i) When a spouse is giving birth to their child;\n(ii) When a loved-one is dying, under palliative care;\nAll of which violate physical and psychological integrity under s. 7 of the Charter, by denial of the explicit mobility rights protected by s.7 of the Charter (liberty and security of the person) as well as the mobility (travel) rights specifically protected under s. 6 of the Charter.\n[Emphasis omitted].\nII. The Evidence before the Federal Court [8] I turn next to briefly review the evidence that was before the Federal Court. The defendants filed an affidavit that attached the TB Policy, the Interim Order, and other orders issued pursuant to the Aeronautics Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. A-2, as well as a list of all of the interim orders related to COVID-19, issued by Transport Canada. The defendants\u2019 evidence established that the provisions in the TB Policy, the Interim Order, and related orders issued by Transport Canada setting out vaccine requirements had been suspended by the time the defendants brought their motion to strike the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\n[9] A review of the TB Policy shows that it was issued by the Treasury Board under sections 7 and 11.1 of the Financial Administration Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-11 [FAA], and applied to employees in the core public administration as set out in Schedules I and IV of the FAA. These include the RCMP, as well as the other federal departments, agencies, and other portions of the public service listed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons. The TB policy required most employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19, failing which they were subject to being placed on administrative leave without pay. The vaccine requirements set out in the TB Policy were terms and conditions of employment for the employees to whom they pertained.\n[10] While the foregoing policies were before the Federal Court, there was no evidence before that Court as to the nature of the grievance rights possessed by the plaintiffs. These rights could accordingly only be discerned through a review of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions applicable to the plaintiffs and the case law interpreting such provisions.\nIII. The Reasons of the Federal Court [11] I turn next to outline the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons. As noted, for those plaintiffs whose claims were dismissed without leave to amend, the Federal Court relied on section 236 of the FPSLRA. That section reads as follows:\nDisputes relating to employment\nDiff\u00e9rend li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019emploi\n236(1) The right of an employee to seek redress by way of grievance for any dispute relating to his or her terms or conditions of employment is in lieu of any right of action that the employee may have in relation to any act or omission giving rise to the dispute.\n236(1) Le droit de recours du fonctionnaire par voie de grief relativement \u00e0 tout diff\u00e9rend li\u00e9 \u00e0 ses conditions d\u2019emploi remplace ses droits d\u2019action en justice relativement aux faits \u2014 actions ou omissions \u2014 \u00e0 l\u2019origine du diff\u00e9rend.\nApplication\nApplication\n(2) Subsection (1) applies whether or not the employee avails himself or herself of the right to present a grievance in any particular case and whether or not the grievance could be referred to adjudication.\n(2) Le paragraphe (1) s\u2019applique que le fonctionnaire se pr\u00e9vale ou non de son droit de pr\u00e9senter un grief et qu\u2019il soit possible ou non de soumettre le grief \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage.\nException\nException\n(3) Subsection (1) does not apply in respect of an employee of a separate agency that has not been designated under subsection 209(3) if the dispute relates to his or her termination of employment for any reason that does not relate to a breach of discipline or misconduct.\n(3) Le paragraphe (1) ne s\u2019applique pas au fonctionnaire d\u2019un organisme distinct qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 au titre du paragraphe 209(3) si le diff\u00e9rend porte sur le licenciement du fonctionnaire pour toute raison autre qu\u2019un manquement \u00e0 la discipline ou une inconduite.\n[12] The Federal Court held that section 236 of the FPSLRA barred the claims of the plaintiffs listed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons, who were members of the RCMP or who worked in the other federal departments, agencies, or portions of the public service. According to the Court, these plaintiffs could have filed grievances challenging the matters to which the Statement of Claim pertained. The Court also held that there was no reason for it to exercise any discretion it might have possessed to relieve the plaintiffs from application of the bar in section 236 of the FPSLRA. The Federal Court therefore dismissed the claims of these plaintiffs in their entirety, without leave to amend.\n[13] As for the other plaintiffs, for whom the Federal Court found that section 236 of the FPSLRA does not apply, the Federal Court struck the Statement of Claim because it found that the plaintiffs failed to plead the requisite material facts in support of their allegations that were potentially justiciable and that they made several non-justiciable allegations. As noted, the Federal Court granted these plaintiffs leave to amend their claims. In so concluding, the Federal Court adopted the reasoning of the British Columbia Supreme Court in Action4Canada v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2022 BCSC 1507, 2022 A.C.W.S. 3823 [Action4Canada], where that Court wrote as follows, at paragraphs 45-48:\n[\u2026] the [Notice of Civil Claim [NOCC]], in its current form, is not a pleading that can properly be answered by a responsive pleading. It describes wide-ranging global conspiracies that may, or may not, have influenced either the federal or the provincial governments. It seeks rulings of the court on issues of science. In addition, it includes improper allegations, including criminal conduct and \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d. In my opinion, it is \u201cbad beyond argument\u201d.\n[46] I further find that it is not a document that the court can mend by striking portions. I find that this NOCC is analogous to the Statement of Claim considered by Justice K. Smith (as he then was) in Homalco Indian Band v. British Columbia (1998), 1998 CanLII 6658 (BC SC), 25 C.P.C. (4th) 107 (B.C.S.C.) [Homalco]. He wrote:\n[11] In my view, the statement of claim is an embarrassing pleading. It contains much that appears to be unnecessary. As well, it is constructed in a manner calculated to confuse the defendants and to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to answer. As a result, it is prejudicial. Any attempt to reform it by striking out portions and by amending other portions is likely to result in more confusion as to the real issues. \u2026\n[47] As was the case in Homalco, attempting to bring the NOCC into compliance with the Rules by piecemeal striking and amending would invite more confusion and greater expenditure of the resources of all concerned.\n[48] I find that the NOCC is prolix. It is not a proper pleading that can be answered by the defendants. It cannot be mended. Given that finding, I have no hesitation in ruling that it must be struck in whole.\n[14] The Federal Court held that identical reasoning applied to the Statement of Claim in the instant case.\n[15] In addition, the Federal Court held that there were numerous claims that could not be advanced in a civil action that were pleaded in the Statement of Claim. These included allegations of criminal behaviour, broad declarations respecting the current state of medical and scientific knowledge, and a declaration that administering medical treatment without informed consent is a crime against humanity.\n[16] The Federal Court added that the relief claimed in paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim, seeking to set aside the Interim Order and TB Policy, could only be obtained via judicial review and not by way of action.\n[17] I note parenthetically that, as the Interim Order is no longer in force, a claim seeking to set it aside may now be moot, as was held in Ben Naoum v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FC 1463, 2022 CarswellNat 4608 aff\u2019d 2023 FCA 219, 2023 CarswellNat 4443, and Pickford v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 219, 2023 CarswellNat 4442. A similar conclusion may well also pertain to a claim to set aside the TB Policy.\n[18] The Federal Court granted the plaintiffs, whom it found were not subject to section 236 of the FPSLRA, leave to amend their claims that were potentially justiciable and the proper subject of an action. For such plaintiffs, the Federal Court cautioned as follows, at paragraphs 55-57 of its Reasons:\n[55] For those Plaintiffs who are employed outside the federal public administration, e.g., with airlines, banks, transportation companies, etc., any amended pleading will have to allege sufficient material facts to provide a basis for the federal Crown\u2019s liability.\n[56] The Plaintiffs who are not subject to s 236 of the FPSLRA have standing to question whether the TB Policy and Interim Order infringed their rights. There is a prospect that the Plaintiffs could put forward a valid claim that certain COVID-related health measures instituted by the Government of Canada contravened their Charter rights. It is possible that other valid claims may exist.\n[57] It will be for the Plaintiffs to plead those causes of action in accordance with the Rules. The claims must be framed in a manner that is intelligible and allows the Defendants to know the case they have to meet. The claims must also be confined to matters that are capable of adjudication by this Court, and seek relief this Court is capable of granting (Action4Canada at para 71).\nIV. Relevant Statutory and Regulatory Provisions [19] It is useful to next lay out the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions.\n[20] Paragraph 7(1)(e) and sections 11 and 11.1 of the FAA grant the Treasury Board authority to set the terms and conditions of employment of employees employed in the public service. This includes the organizations listed in Schedules I, IV, and V to the FAA, which encompass the RCMP and the other federal departments, agencies, and other portions of the public service listed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons.\n[21] Part 2 of the FPSLRA sets out grievance rights for certain employees employed in the federal public service, and Part 2.1 of that statute sets out a different set of grievance rights for members of the RCMP. Additional grievance and complaint rights are provided to RCMP members under the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. R-10 [RCMP Act], as well as the Regulations and Standing Orders under that Act.\n[22] Turning first to the FPSLRA, Part 2 of the FPSLRA affords grievance rights to \u201cemployees\u201d, as defined in the statute. For the purposes of Part 2 of the FPSLRA, \u201cemployee\u201d is defined in paragraph 206(1) as follows:\nDefinitions\nD\u00e9finitions\n206 (1) The following definitions apply in this Part.\nemployee means a person employed in the public service, other than\n206 (1) Les d\u00e9finitions qui suivent s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente partie.\nfonctionnaire Personne employ\u00e9e dans la fonction publique, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de toute personne :\n(a) a person appointed by the Governor in Council under an Act of Parliament to a statutory position described in that Act;\na) nomm\u00e9e par le gouverneur en conseil, en vertu d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00e0 un poste pr\u00e9vu par cette loi;\n(b) a person locally engaged outside Canada;\nb) recrut\u00e9e sur place \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger;\n(c) a person not ordinarily required to work more than one third of the normal period for persons doing similar work;\nc) qui n\u2019est pas ordinairement astreinte \u00e0 travailler plus du tiers du temps normalement exig\u00e9 des personnes ex\u00e9cutant des t\u00e2ches semblables;\n(d) a person who is an officer as defined in subsection 2(1) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act;\nd) qui est un officier, au sens du paragraphe 2(1) de la Loi sur la Gendarmerie royale du Canada;\n(e) a person employed on a casual basis;\ne) employ\u00e9e \u00e0 titre occasionnel;\n(f) a person employed on a term basis, unless the term of employment is for a period of three months or more or the person has been so employed for a period of three months or more;\nf) employ\u00e9e pour une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de moins de trois mois ou ayant travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 ce titre pendant moins de trois mois;\n(g) a member as defined in subsection 2(1) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act who occupies a managerial or confidential position; or\ng) qui est un membre, au sens du paragraphe 2(1) de la Loi sur la Gendarmerie royale du Canada, et qui occupe un poste de direction ou de confiance;\n(h) a person who is employed under a program designated by the employer as a student employment program. (fonctionnaire)\nh) employ\u00e9e dans le cadre d\u2019un programme d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par l\u2019employeur comme un programme d\u2019embauche des \u00e9tudiants. (employee)\n[23] \u201cPublic service\u201d is also a defined term in the FPSLRA. Subsection 2(1) of the FPSLRA defines \u201cpublic service\u201d as follows:\npublic service, except in Part 3, means the several positions in or under\nfonction publique Sauf \u00e0 la partie 3, l\u2019ensemble des postes qui sont compris dans les entit\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s ou qui en rel\u00e8vent :\n(a) the departments named in Schedule I to the Financial Administration Act;\na) les minist\u00e8res figurant \u00e0 l\u2019annexe I de la Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques;\n(b) the other portions of the federal public administration named in Schedule IV to that Act; and\nb) les autres secteurs de l\u2019administration publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale figurant \u00e0 l\u2019annexe IV de cette loi;\n(c) the separate agencies named in Schedule V to that Act. (fonction publique)\nc) les organismes distincts figurant \u00e0 l\u2019annexe V de la m\u00eame loi. (public service)\n[24] As noted, at the request of the Federal Court, the parties developed a list of all the departments, agencies, or other portions of the public administration in which the plaintiffs worked. That list is appended as Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons.\n[25] It is useful to next repeat section 236 of the FPSLRA, which reads as follows:\nNo Right of Action\nAbsence de droit d\u2019action\nDisputes relating to employment\nDiff\u00e9rend li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019emploi\n236 (1) The right of an employee to seek redress by way of grievance for any dispute relating to his or her terms or conditions of employment is in lieu of any right of action that the employee may have in relation to any act or omission giving rise to the dispute.\n236 (1) Le droit de recours du fonctionnaire par voie de grief relativement \u00e0 tout diff\u00e9rend li\u00e9 \u00e0 ses conditions d\u2019emploi remplace ses droits d\u2019action en justice relativement aux faits \u2014 actions ou omissions \u2014 \u00e0 l\u2019origine du diff\u00e9rend.\nApplication\nApplication\n(2) Subsection (1) applies whether or not the employee avails himself or herself of the right to present a grievance in any particular case and whether or not the grievance could be referred to adjudication.\n(2) Le paragraphe (1) s\u2019applique que le fonctionnaire se pr\u00e9vale ou non de son droit de pr\u00e9senter un grief et qu\u2019il soit possible ou non de soumettre le grief \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage.\nException\nException\n(3) Subsection (1) does not apply in respect of an employee of a separate agency that has not been designated under subsection 209(3) if the dispute relates to his or her termination of employment for any reason that does not relate to a breach of discipline or misconduct.\u2026\n(3) Le paragraphe (1) ne s\u2019applique pas au fonctionnaire d\u2019un organisme distinct qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 au titre du paragraphe 209(3) si le diff\u00e9rend porte sur le licenciement du fonctionnaire pour toute raison autre qu\u2019un manquement \u00e0 la discipline ou une inconduite.\n[26] \u201cGrievance\u201d is a defined term in the FPSLRA, which separately defines \u201cgroup grievances\u201d, \u201cindividual grievances\u201d, and a \u201cpolicy grievances\u201d. Of the foregoing, only individual grievances are relevant to the instant case. They are defined in subsection 206(1) of the FPSLRA as meaning either a grievance presented in accordance with section 208 of the FPSLRA or one presented in accordance with section 238.24 of the FPSLRA.\n[27] Section 208 of the FPSLRA is contained in Part 2 (applicable to employees generally) and section 238.4 is contained in Part 2.1 of the FPSLRA (applicable to members of the RCMP who meet the statutory definition of employee under the FPSLRA).\n[28] Section 208 provides, in relevant part as follows:\nRight of employee\nDroit du fonctionnaire\n208(1) Subject to subsections (2) to (7), an employee is entitled to present an individual grievance if he or she feels aggrieved\n208(1) Sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (2) \u00e0 (7), le fonctionnaire a le droit de pr\u00e9senter un grief individuel lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019estime l\u00e9s\u00e9 :\n(a) by the interpretation or application, in respect of the employee, of\na) par l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ou l\u2019application \u00e0 son \u00e9gard :\n(i) a provision of a statute or regulation, or of a direction or other instrument made or issued by the employer, that deals with terms and conditions of employment, or\n(i) soit de toute disposition d\u2019une loi ou d\u2019un r\u00e8glement, ou de toute directive ou de tout autre document de l\u2019employeur concernant les conditions d\u2019emploi,\n(ii) a provision of a collective agreement or an arbitral award; or\n(ii) soit de toute disposition d\u2019une convention collective ou d\u2019une d\u00e9cision arbitrale;\n(b) as a result of any occurrence or matter affecting his or her terms and conditions of employment.\nb) par suite de tout fait portant atteinte \u00e0 ses conditions d\u2019emploi.\nLimitation\nR\u00e9serve\n(2) An employee may not present an individual grievance in respect of which an administrative procedure for redress is provided under any Act of Parliament, other than the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n(2) Le fonctionnaire ne peut pr\u00e9senter de grief individuel si un recours administratif de r\u00e9paration lui est ouvert sous le r\u00e9gime d\u2019une autre loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n\u2026\n[\u2026]\n(4) An employee may not present an individual grievance relating to the interpretation or application, in respect of the employee, of a provision of a collective agreement or an arbitral award unless the employee has the approval of and is represented by the bargaining agent for the bargaining unit to which the collective agreement or arbitral award applies.\n(4) Le fonctionnaire ne peut pr\u00e9senter de grief individuel portant sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ou l\u2019application \u00e0 son \u00e9gard de toute disposition d\u2019une convention collective ou d\u2019une d\u00e9cision arbitrale qu\u2019\u00e0 condition d\u2019avoir obtenu l\u2019approbation de l\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation \u00e0 laquelle s\u2019applique la convention collective ou la d\u00e9cision arbitrale et d\u2019\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par cet agent.\n(5) An employee who, in respect of any matter, avails himself or herself of a complaint procedure established by a policy of the employer may not present an individual grievance in respect of that matter if the policy expressly provides that an employee who avails himself or herself of the complaint procedure is precluded from presenting an individual grievance under this Act.\n(5) Le fonctionnaire qui choisit, pour une question donn\u00e9e, de se pr\u00e9valoir de la proc\u00e9dure de plainte institu\u00e9e par une ligne directrice de l\u2019employeur ne peut pr\u00e9senter de grief individuel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette question sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi si la ligne directrice pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment cette impossibilit\u00e9.\n[29] Section 238.02 of the FPSLRA provides that section 208 does not apply to RCMP members. It reads in relevant part as follows:\nInconsistency with Part 1 or 2\nIncompatibilit\u00e9\n238.02 (1) In the event of an inconsistency between a provision of this Part and a provision of Part 1 or 2, the provision of this Part prevails to the extent of the inconsistency.\n238.02 (1) Les dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente partie l\u2019emportent sur les dispositions incompatibles des parties 1 et 2.\nInconsistency \u2014 clarification\nPr\u00e9cision sur l\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9\n(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), section 58, subsections 208(1) and 209(1) and (2) and section 209.1 are inconsistent with this Part.\n(2) Pour l\u2019application du paragraphe (1), sont notamment incompatibles avec la pr\u00e9sente partie, l\u2019article 58, les paragraphes 208(1) et 209(1) et (2) et l\u2019article 209.1.\nClarification\nPr\u00e9cision\n(3) For greater certainty,\n(3) Il est entendu que :\n(a) the provisions of Part 1, in so far as they are applicable, apply to employees who are RCMP members or reservists unless there is an indication to the contrary; and\na) les dispositions de la partie 1, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles sont applicables, s\u2019appliquent aux fonctionnaires qui sont des membres de la GRC ou des r\u00e9servistes, \u00e0 moins d\u2019indication contraire;\n(b) the provisions of Part 2, in so far as they are applicable, apply to employees who are RCMP members, as defined in subsection 238.01(2), or reservists unless there is an indication to the contrary.\nb) les dispositions de la partie 2, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles sont applicables, s\u2019appliquent aux fonctionnaires qui sont des membres de la GRC, au sens du paragraphe 238.01(2), ou des r\u00e9servistes, \u00e0 moins d\u2019indication contraire.\n[30] Section 238.24 of the FPSLRA sets out the grievance rights of RCMP members under the FPSLRA. Those grievance rights only extend to grievances filed under a collective agreement. Section 238.24 of the FPSLRA provides as follows:\n238.24 Subject to subsections 208(2) to (7), an employee who is an RCMP member is entitled to present an individual grievance only if they feel aggrieved by the interpretation or application, in respect of the employee, of a provision of a collective agreement or arbitral award.\n238.24 Sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes 208(2) \u00e0 (7), le fonctionnaire membre de la GRC a le droit de pr\u00e9senter un grief individuel seulement lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019estime l\u00e9s\u00e9 par l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ou l\u2019application \u00e0 son \u00e9gard de toute disposition d\u2019une convention collective ou d\u2019une d\u00e9cision arbitrale.\n[31] Under the FPSLRA, only some of the matters that may be grieved can be referred to adjudication before the Federal Public Sector Labour and Employment Board (the FPSLREB).\n[32] For employees generally, subsection 209(1) of the FPSLRA provides:\nReference to Adjudication\nRenvoi

renvoyer un grief \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage\n238.25 (1) An employee who is an RCMP member may refer to adjudication an individual grievance that has been presented up to and including the final level in the grievance process and that has not been dealt with to the employee\u2019s satisfaction only if the grievance is related to the interpretation or application, in respect of the employee, of a provision of a collective agreement or arbitral award.\n238.25 (1) Le fonctionnaire membre de la GRC peut, apr\u00e8s l\u2019avoir port\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au dernier palier de la proc\u00e9dure

employee who is an RCMP member may refer the grievance to adjudication only if the employee has suffered physical or psychological harm, property damage or economic loss as a result of \u2014 or has otherwise been adversely affected by \u2014 the contravention.\n(3) Si le grief vis\u00e9 au paragraphe (1) est relatif \u00e0 une contravention \u00e0 une disposition des r\u00e8glements pris en vertu du paragraphe 117(1) de la Loi canadienne sur l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9, le fonctionnaire membre de la GRC peut seulement le renvoyer \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage que s\u2019il a subi des

contravention.\n[34] As noted, RCMP members also possess grievance rights under the RCMP Act and Regulations and Standing Orders under that Act.\n[35] More specifically, section 31 of the RCMP Act provides in relevant part as follows:\nMember\u2019s right\nR\u00e8gle\n31(1) Subject to subsections (1.01) to (3), if a member is aggrieved by a decision, act or omission in the administration of the

of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Regulations, 2014, SOR\/2014-281, and the Commissioner\u2019s Standing Orders (Grievances and Appeals), SOR\/2014-289. This legislation also contains provisions allowing members to file complaints where they have been disciplined under the RCMP\u2019s Code of Conduct.\nV. Analysis [37] I turn now to discuss the various issues that arise in this appeal. The appellate standard of review applies to the Federal Court\u2019s judgment. Errors of law are reviewable for correctness, whereas errors of fact or of mixed fact and law, which do not disclose an extricable legal issue, are reviewable for palpable and overriding error: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235; Mahjoub v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FCA 157, [2018] 2 F.C.R. 344 at para.72, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 37793 (17 May 2018), citing Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, 2016 FCA 215, [2017] 1 F.C.R. 331 at paras. 28 and 71\u201372, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 37342 (22 June 2017); Decor Grates Incorporated v. Imperial Manufacturing Group Inc., 2015 FCA 100, [2016] 1 F.C.R. 246 at para. 18.\n[38] In striking the claims for which no leave to amend was granted, the Federal Court held that certain claims disclosed no cause of action because they did not exist at law. These determinations are legal in nature and thus fully reviewable by this Court for correctness: Jensen v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 2023 FCA 89, 482 D.L.R. (4th) 504 at paras. 32-36, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 40807 (11 January 2024) [Samsung], citing Pioneer Corp. v. Godfrey, 2019 SCC 42, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 295 at para. 27, aff\u2019d 2019 SCC 42, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 295. The Federal Court\u2019s interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions also raises legal issues reviewable for correctness.\n[39] Conversely, the Federal Court\u2019s conclusions as to the adequacy of the material facts pleaded are reviewable under the palpable and overriding standard of review: Samsung at para. 38. Likewise, its determination to not exercise its residual discretion to allow the action to advance is reviewable under the palpable and overriding error standard of review: Canada v. Greenwood, 2021 FCA 186, [2021] 4 F.C.R. 635 at paras. 119-120, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 39885 (17 March 2022) [Greenwood].\n[40] A pleading may be struck for disclosing no reasonable cause of action only where this is plain and obvious: Berenguer v. Sata Internacional - Azores Airlines, S.A., 2023 FCA 176, 2023 CarswellNat 2983 at para. 23, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 40949 (11 April 2024) [Berenguer], citing Nevsun Resources Ltd. v. Araya, 2020 SCC 5, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 166 at para. 64; R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45 at para. 17. The plain and obvious test applies to both the discernment of whether a claim pleaded is justiciable and to the discernment of whether it falls within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court: Berenguer at para. 24; Windsor (City) v. Canadian Transit Co., 2016 SCC 54, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 617 at para. 24. Where the issue is a jurisdictional one, evidence is admissible and, indeed, may be required: Berenguer at para. 26; Greenwood at para. 95; MIL Davie Inc. v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Exploitation et de D\u00e9veloppement d\u2019Hibernia Lt\u00e9e (1998), 226 N.R. 369, 1998 CanLII 7789 (FCA) at paras. 7-8.\n[41] Bearing the foregoing general principles in mind, I turn next to assess the issues that arise in this appeal. In my view, they may be usefully broken down as follows:\nDid the Federal Court err in determining that the plaintiffs employed by the RCMP were subject to the bar in section 236 of the FPSLRA?\nDid the Federal Court err in determining that the bar in section 236 of the FPSLRA forecloses the right of action for claims in respect of the Interim Order and other travel related restrictions?\nDid the Federal Court err in striking, without leave to amend, the claims related to the TB Policy made by the plaintiffs who were employed by the organizations listed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons?\nDid the Federal Court err in finding certain other claims to be non-justiciable?\nDid the Federal Court err in striking the Statement of Claim due its being generally improper and failing to plead necessary material facts?\nA. Did the Federal Court err in determining that the plaintiffs employed by the RCMP were subject to the bar in section 236 of the FPSLRA? [42] On the first issue, I conclude that the Federal Court erred in finding that the bar in section 236 of the FPSLRA applies to the plaintiffs who were members of the RCMP.\n[43] It will be recalled that subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA provides that the \u201cright of an employee to seek redress by way of grievance for any dispute relating to his or her terms or conditions of employment is in lieu of any right of action that the employee may have in relation to any act or omission giving rise to the dispute\u201d.\n[44] To recall, the relevant definition of what constitutes a grievance is set out in subsection 206(1) of the FPSLRA. That section states that a grievance is one that may be filed under either section 208 or 238.4 of the FPSLRA. Thus, the bar in section 236 applies only to those who could seek redress via a grievance under section 208 or 238.4 of the FPSLRA.\n[45] Yet, section 238.4 of the FPSLRA applies only to grievances arising under a collective agreement applicable to RCMP members who meet the statutory definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the FPSLRA. Based on the materials that were before the Federal Court and that are now before this Court, it is impossible to ascertain whether any collective agreement has been negotiated for RCMP members. The National Police Federation was certified as the bargaining agent for RCMP members in 2019 by the FPSLREB in National Police Federation v. Treasury Board, 2019 FPSLREB 74. However, it is unclear if a collective agreement has been achieved and, if so, whether a challenge to the TB Policy could be the subject of a grievance under any such agreement. Given this lack of information, it is not plain and obvious that the plaintiffs who were members of the RCMP possessed rights to grieve the TB Policy under a grievance to which section 238.24 of the FPSLRA pertains.\n[46] Further, section 208 of the FPSLRA is inapplicable to RCMP members by virtue of section 238.02 of that Act. Indeed, the FPSLREB recently confirmed in Fr\u00e9my v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2021 FPSLREB 47 that the only grievance rights RCMP members possess under the FPSLRA arise under section 238.24 of the FPSLRA and thus only pertain to alleged violations of a collective agreement.\n[47] I note that many actions have proceeded against the RCMP for workplace issues, including class actions for matters that could have been the subject of grievances under the RCMP Act or Regulations or Standing Orders issued under that Act: see e.g. Greenwood at paras. 81, 160; Tiller v. Canada, 2019 FC 895, 307 A.C.W.S. (3d) 470; Merlo v. Canada, 2017 FC 533, 281 A.C.W.S. 3(d) 702; Davidson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 ONSC 8008, 262 A.C.W.S. (3d) 648. There was no suggestion by the respondent in any of the foregoing cases that the bar in section 236 of the FPSLRA applied.\n[48] I therefore conclude that the Federal Court erred in finding that section 236 of the FPSLRA foreclosed the action by the plaintiffs who were members of the RCMP as it is not plain and obvious that the provision applies to them.\nB. Did the Federal Court err in determining that the bar in section 236 of the FPSLRA forecloses the right of action for claims in respect of the Interim Order and other travel related restrictions? [49] I turn now to the second issue in this appeal and conclude that the Federal Court erred in determining that the bar in section 236 of the FPSLRA applied to the claims related to the Interim Order or the other travel impediments faced by the plaintiffs. These claims should not have been struck without leave to amend.\n[50] The Interim Order and related measures could not be the subject of a grievance under either the FPSLRA, the RCMP Act or Regulations or Standing Orders promulgated under the latter Act.\n[51] The FPSLRA grants grievance rights only in respect of employment-related matters and the bar in section 236 applies only to disputes \u201crelating to an employee\u2019s terms and conditions of employment\u201d. The Interim Order and related travel measures were general measures that applied to all Canadians and were not imposed on the plaintiffs as a result of their employment. Thus, they could not be grieved under the FPSLRA and section 236 of the FPSLRA does not apply to them.\n[52] Likewise, the Interim Order and related travel measures impugned by the plaintiffs could not be the subject of a grievance under the RCMP Act or the Regulations or Standing Orders promulgated under that Act. The Interim Order and other travel-related measures applied to RCMP members like all Canadians, irrespective of their employment and were not \u201ca decision, act or omission in the administration of the affairs\u201d of the RCMP, within the meaning of section 31 of the RCMP Act.\n[53] The Federal Court therefore erred in finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims related to the Interim Order and other travel-related measures could have been grieved or were subject to section 236 of the FPSLRA. While these claims suffer from the lack of proper pleadings and a failure to plead the necessary material facts that characterize the Statement of Claim generally, they should not have been struck without leave to amend. If properly pleaded, it may perhaps be possible for the plaintiffs to raise a claim that could come within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. Without seeing an amended pleading, however, it is impossible to discern whether or not a valid claim might be advanced. The plaintiffs therefore should have been granted leave to amend the claims related to the Interim Order and other travel-related measures on the same basis as the Federal Court allowed other claims to be amended.\nC. Did the Federal Court err in striking, without leave to amend, the claims related to the TB Policy made by the plaintiffs who were employed by the organizations listed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons? [54] On the third issue, I conclude that the Federal Court did not err in striking, without leave to amend, the claims related to the TB Policy made by the plaintiffs who were employed by the organizations listed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons, other than the RCMP. However, the Federal Court erred in striking the claims of RCMP members related to the TB Policy.\n[55] It is not disputed that the plaintiffs who were employed by organizations other than the RCMP could have filed grievances under section 208 of the FPSLRA challenging the TB Policy or its application to them. As noted, the TB Policy was a term and condition of employment and thus subject to grievance under section 208 of the FPSLRA, which allows the employees of the organizations listed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons other than the RCMP to file grievances relating to their terms and conditions of employment. That said, the FPSLREB recently held in Rehibi v. Deputy Head (Department of Employment and Social Development, 2024 FPSLREB 47, that a grievance challenging the application of the TB Policy could not be referred to adjudication due to the fact that only a subset of matters that may be grieved under the FPSLRA may be referred to adjudication under subsection 209(1) of the FPSLRA.\n[56] The bar in section 236 of the FPSLRA applies to matters that may be grieved as opposed to those that may be adjudicated. In determining whether an issue is one that may be grieved, what matters is the essence of the claim made and not the way the claim is characterized in the Statement of Claim. Thus, it matters not that the plaintiffs allege a Charter breach or various tort claims; one must instead look to the essential character of the dispute to determine if it raises a matter that could have been the subject of a grievance: Vaughan v. Canada, 2005 SCC 11, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 146 at para. 13; Weber v. Ontario Hydro, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 929, 1995 CanLII 108 at para. 52 [Weber]; Ebadi v. Canada, 2024 FCA 39, [2024] F.C.J. No. 380 at para. 24 [Ebadi].\n[57] Here, compliance with the TB Policy was a term and condition of employment for the plaintiffs employed by the organizations listed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons. The requirement to have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or face a leave without pay could therefore have been grieved under section 208 of the FPSLRA by those employed in the organizations listed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons, other than the RCMP.\n[58] The case law interpreting section 236 of the FPSLRA recognizes that the section is a complete bar to a right of action for any matter that may be the subject of a grievance, subject to the possible caveat that a court may possess the discretion to hear the claim if the internal grievance process does not or cannot provide an adequate remedy or, perhaps, if the case is otherwise exceptional: Ebadi, at para. 47; Bron v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 ONCA 71, 99 O.R. (3d) 749 at paras. 29 and 32; Robichaud v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 NBCA 3, 225 A.C.W.S. (3d) 430 at para.10.\n[59] Here, the Federal Court had no evidence before it as to the efficacy of the grievance process. I therefore conclude that the Federal Court did not err in striking the claims related to the TB Policy made by the plaintiffs who were employed by the organizations listed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons other than the RCMP by virtue of section 236 of the FPSLRA. It was incumbent on the plaintiffs to have filed evidence about the efficacy of the grievance process if they wished the Court to exercise its discretion to hear the claim, as the plaintiffs did in Greenwood. In the absence of any such evidence pointing to any inefficacy of the grievance procedure, it was open to the Federal Court to have reached the conclusion that it did and to have struck, without leave to amend, the claims related to the TB Policy made by the plaintiffs employed by the organizations listed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons other than the RCMP.\n[60] For the plaintiffs employed by the RCMP, on the other hand, it is unclear whether they possessed rights to grieve the TB Policy under the RCMP Act or the Regulations and Standing Orders under that Act. And, for the reasons already noted above, it is not plain and obvious that they could have grieved under the FPSLRA.\n[61] The TB Policy was not adopted by the RCMP, but rather by the Treasury Board. It is not plain and obvious that its application would be \u201ca decision, act or omission in the administration of the affairs of the Force\u201d that would be grievable under section 31 of the RCMP Act. Somewhat similar policies have been found not to be subject to grievance under the RCMP Act because they are not decisions, acts or omissions made in the administration of the affairs of the Force.\n[62] For example, in Pasic v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FC 1171, 2022 CarswellNat 3030, the Federal Court upheld a decision of the Final Level Adjudicator in the RCMP grievance process. The Adjudicator dismissed the applicant\u2019s grievance challenging where he was placed on the pay grid because pay was fixed by Treasury Board not the RCMP and therefore the grievance could not be dealt with under the RCMP Act.\n[63] To similar effect, in Commissioner of the RCMP\u2019s grievance decision G-335, dated April 14, 2005, an RCMP member sought to challenge a decision made by an employee of Treasury Board Secretariat to decline to declare the community in which the member resided prior to being transferred a \u201cdepressed housing market\u201d. The Commissioner found that he had no jurisdiction to hear a grievance that was based solely on a decision which was rendered by Treasury Board and adopted the External Review Committee\u2019s finding that \u201cthe mere fact that the relocation benefits which are at issue in this grievance pertain to the performance of the member\u2019s duties as an RCMP member cannot suffice to subject the decision made by an employee of another government department to a grievance process that is internal to the RCMP\u201d: see RCMP External Review Committee, \u201cGrievance Case Summary - G-335\u201d, online: <https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/rcmp-external-review-committee\/services\/case-summaries\/grievance\/g-335.html>. Similarly, in grievance decision G-255, dated March 28, 2001, an RCMP member, stationed in an Isolated Post, contested a decision declaring him ineligible to receive an allowance for fuel and utilities expenses, which was available only under certain conditions (not met by the member), through the Isolated Posts Directive, issued by the Treasury Board. The Commissioner similarly found that he had no jurisdiction to hear the grievance because the RCMP had no authority to pay a fuel and utilities allowance in light of the Treasury Board\u2019s Isolated Posts Directive: see RCMP External Review Committee, \u201cGrievance Case Summary - G-255\u201d, online: <https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/rcmp-external-review-committee\/services\/case-summaries\/grievance\/g-255.html>. Likewise, in grievance decision G\u2011484, dated November 6, 2012, an RCMP member grieved the Vacation Travel Assistance rate for his isolated post, which was fixed by the Treasury Board. The Commissioner again found that the member did not have standing to grieve this issue because it was not a decision, act or omission made in the administration of the affairs of the Force: see RCMP External Review Committee, \u201cGrievance Case Summary - G-484\u201d, online: <https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/rcmp-external-review-committee\/services\/case-summaries\/grievance\/g-484.html>.\n[64] Since the defendants sought to strike the Statement of Claim based on the fact that a grievance process was available, it was incumbent on the defendants to establish that the TB Policy could have been grieved by RCMP members. However, no evidence was tendered on this issue and the statutory scheme is not sufficiently clear to definitively establish that the TB Policy could have been grieved by RCMP members. I therefore conclude that the Federal Court erred in striking the claims of RCMP members related to the TB Policy without leave to amend. The plaintiffs who were members of the RCMP should have been granted leave to amend their claims related to the TB Policy on the same basis as the plaintiffs who were employed by organizations other than those listed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons were granted leave to amend.\nD. Did the Federal Court err in finding certain other claims to be non-justiciable? [65] I see no error in the Federal Court\u2019s determination that allegations of criminal behaviour, broad declarations respecting the current state of medical and scientific knowledge, and a declaration that administering medical treatment without informed consent is a crime against humanity, are not justiciable in a civil action.\n[66] As for the validity of the TB Policy and the Interim Order, it would appear that those issues may now well be moot. In addition, while it might have been possible to argue that the policies at issue were invalid in the context of a justiciable claim for relief on some other basis in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada (Attorney General) v. TeleZone Inc., 2010 SCC 62, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 585, the Federal Court did not err in holding that an order setting aside the TB Policy and the Interim Order could only be obtained by way of an application for judicial review.\n[67] I accordingly see no basis for setting aside any of the foregoing rulings made by the Federal Court.\nE. Did the Federal Court err in striking the Statement of Claim due to its being generally improper and failing to plead necessary material facts? [68] Finally, I see no error in the Federal Court\u2019s finding that the Statement of Claim was improperly pleaded and lacked the necessary material facts. As noted in Mancuso v. Canada (National Health and Welfare) 2015 FCA 227, [2015] F.C.J. No. 1245 at para. 16, a plaintiff must plead, in summary form, but with sufficient detail, the constituent facts to support the relief sought. As the Federal Court rightly noted in this case, for the claims in respect of which leave to amend is granted, the plaintiffs must set out with sufficient particularity the facts they rely on in support of their claim, including details of how they were specifically impacted by the policies they impugn and the bases for and all material facts necessary to ground the claims advanced. The Statement of Claim, as drafted, is entirely devoid of these necessary material facts.\n[69] I therefore see no reviewable error in the decision to strike the Statement of Claim in its entirety.

The Tax Court decision, written by Justice St-Hilaire, was reported as 2023 TCC 104.\n[2] In the Tax Court, the parties agreed that the Minister had correctly calculated the amount of unreported income. In particular, the appellant conceded that he received unreported shareholder appropriations totalling $512,211 in the four years that were assessed. The dispute was whether the Minister of National Revenue was precluded from assessing because the relevant taxation years were statute barred. The appellant also disputed that gross negligence penalties should have been assessed.\n[3] The Tax Court dismissed the appeal. It found that the assessments were not statute barred because the appellant\u2019s failure to include the shareholder appropriations in his income was a misrepresentation due to carelessness or neglect. In this regard, the Court found that the appellant did not exercise reasonable care to report the proper amount of income. The Court also found that gross negligence penalties were justified because the appellant\u2019s conduct fell markedly below what would be expected of a reasonable person in his circumstances.\n[4] The appellant had testified that he knew very little about taxes and simply relied on his accountant to prepare the returns based on the financial information he had provided. The suggestion was that the misrepresentation in the returns was the fault of the accountant and not the appellant.\n[5] The Tax Court determined that it was not sufficient to simply rely on the accountant without asking any questions. The Court noted that the appellant was a very successful business owner in Canada who had previously graduated from high school and studied physics for two years at university in his home country of Afghanistan. Further, the Court commented that the amount of income that was not reported far exceeded the income that was reported. In the four years at issue, the total unreported income was over $500,000 and the income actually reported in the returns in that period was less than $40,000.\n[6] In this Court, the appellant submits that it is not possible to properly review the Tax Court decision because that Court was not able to provide a transcript. However, we are not satisfied that a transcript is necessary in this particular case. The basis for the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion was succinctly stated at paragraph 35 of its reasons: \u201c[T]he Appellant cannot simply throw his hands up and say that he blindly relied on his accountant, without making any attempt at seeking a better understanding of his obligations and without making any effort to verify the accuracy of the income reported in his income tax returns.\u201d This conclusion is well supported by facts that are supported without a transcript. A transcript is unnecessary.\n[7] The appellant also submits that the Tax Court erred by relying on facts stated in the Reply. Relying on the Reply would be an error since the Crown has the burden of proof. The respondent disagrees that the Tax Court relied on the Reply and submits that all of the facts set out in the Tax Court\u2019s reasons were supported by evidence (including evidence given on cross-examination of the appellant) or by admission. However, the respondent acknowledges that some of the facts cannot be verified because there is no transcript.\n[8] In our view, the disagreement on this point does not matter. The disputed facts were not central to the Tax Court\u2019s decision and there was other evidence that clearly supports its conclusion.\n[9] Finally, the appellant submits that the Tax Court took an unduly strict approach to what constitutes carelessness or neglect. There is no basis for this Court to intervene on this. The determination is largely one of fact. This Court can interfere only in the case of a palpable and overriding error. We are satisfied that there is no such error.\n[10] We are also not persuaded by the appellant\u2019s other arguments. We are all of the view that the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion is well supported by facts and by the legal authorities that the Court relied on. There is no basis for this Court to intervene.\n[11] The appeal will be dismissed, with costs.\n\u201cJudith Woods\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-201-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMOHAMMAD YADGAR v.

It reads in part:\n(6) No tax is payable under this Part by a trust that is governed by a TFSA on its taxable income for a taxation year, except that, if at any time in the taxation year, it carries on one or more businesses or holds one or more properties that are non-qualified investments (as defined in subsection 207.01(1)) for the trust, tax is payable under this Part by the trust on the amount that would be its taxable income for the taxation year if it had no incomes or losses from sources other than those businesses and properties, and no capital gains or capital losses other than from dispositions of those properties, \u2026\n(6) Aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019est \u00e0 payer en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie par une fiducie r\u00e9gie par un compte d\u2019\u00e9pargne libre d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur son revenu imposable pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. Toutefois, si, au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, la fiducie exploite une ou plusieurs entreprises ou d\u00e9tient un ou plusieurs biens qui sont, pour elle, des placements non admissibles, au sens du paragraphe 207.01(1), l\u2019imp\u00f4t pr\u00e9vu par la pr\u00e9sente partie est \u00e0 payer par la fiducie sur la somme qui correspondrait \u00e0 son revenu imposable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e si ses seules sources de revenu ou de perte \u00e9taient ces entreprises ou ces biens et ses seuls gains en capital ou pertes en capital d\u00e9coulaient de la disposition de ces biens. [\u2026]\n[emphasis added]\n[mon soulignement]\n[3] No facts were in dispute. The sole issue before the Tax Court was whether tax is payable by a TFSA trust on income from carrying on a business of trading in qualified investments. The Tax Court concluded that income earned by a TFSA trust from carrying on any business, including a business involving only qualified investments, is taxable under subsection 146.2(6). As the appellant carried on such a business, the Tax Court dismissed the appeals: Reasons at para. 8.\n[4] The appellant raises two issues in this Court.\n[5] First, the appellant argues that the Tax Court erred in interpreting subsection 146.2(6). The standard of review for a question of statutory interpretation is correctness: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 at para. 8; Canada v. Villa Ste-Rose Inc., 2021 FCA 35 at para. 27.\n[6] Second, the appellant argues that the Tax Court erred in law by declining to admit the \u201cPook Letter\u201d, which it sought to adduce, in a pre-trial motion, as an extrinsic aid to statutory interpretation. In our view, the decision on the letter did not involve an extricable question of law. The Tax Court refused to admit the Pook Letter because it was irrelevant. Accordingly, this aspect of the Tax Court\u2019s decision is reviewable only for palpable and overriding error: Housen at para. 36; Ahamed v. Canada, 2020 FCA 213 at paras. 31-32.\n[7] The appellant\u2019s central statutory interpretation argument is that the exemption from tax for a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) trust on business income from, or from the disposition of, qualified investments (paragraph 146(4)(b)) should be read into subsection 146.2(6). The appellant submits that the RRSP regime and the TFSA regime are \u201cmirror images\u201d of each other, and so the exemption should apply to both regimes. The Tax Court disagreed.\n[8] The Tax Court conducted a detailed textual, contextual, and purposive analysis, as required: Canada v. Loblaw Financial Holdings Inc., 2021 SCC 51 at para. 41. Beginning with the text, the Tax Court found the phrase \u201ccarries on one or more businesses\u201d clear, and broad enough to capture all businesses: Reasons at paras. 67 and 89.\n[9] In considering context, the Tax Court noted important differences between the TFSA and RRSP regimes; their components were not interchangeable: Reasons at para. 71. If Parliament had wanted to exempt the income of TFSA trusts from carrying on a business of trading in qualified investments, as it did for RRSP trusts, \u201c[it] would have said so\u201d: Reasons at para. 80.\n[10] The Tax Court observed that both it and this Court have confirmed that the purpose of the TFSA regime is to allow Canadians to increase savings by earning tax-free investment income: Reasons at paras. 73-74. That purpose was advanced within certain limits, including the type of income that could accumulate tax-free within a TFSA trust: Reasons at para. 78. The Tax Court refused to override the clear language of subsection 146.2(6) based on purported policies transplanted from a different statutory regime: Reasons at paras. 89 and 92.\n[11] We see no legal error in these conclusions.\n[12] At the hearing, the appellant acknowledged that, on the basis of the factors set out in Vancouver Art Metal Works Ltd. v. Canada, [1993] 2 F.C. 179 (C.A.) at 187, 47 D.T.C. 5116, it would be considered to be carrying on a business of trading in qualified investments. The Tax Court correctly concluded that subsection 146.2(6) incorporates the well-established test for \u201ccarrying on business\u201d (Reasons at para. 72), and Vancouver Art sets out some relevant factors to consider in determining whether the purchase and sale of securities amounts to the carrying on of a business. Nonetheless, the appellant submits that the phrase \u201ccarries on one or more businesses\u201d in subsection 146.2(6) should be read so that a TFSA trust that carries on a business of trading investments under well-established common law principles should not be considered to carry on a business for purposes of subsection 146.2(6) when the business involves only trading in qualified investments.\n[13] We find that position untenable. We agree with the Tax Court that the appellant\u2019s reading is unsupported by the text, context, and purpose of subsection 146.2(6), and would amount to a re-drafting of the provision: Reasons at paras. 91-92. It is not for this Court to make new tax policy or amend existing tax legislation: Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54 at para. 41; Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 SCC 49 at para. 96.\n[14] Accordingly, we reject the appellant\u2019s statutory interpretation argument.\n[15] We also find no palpable and overriding error in the Tax Court\u2019s decision not to admit the Pook Letter as an extrinsic aid. Contrary to the appellant\u2019s assertions, the Tax Court did not rule that the letter was inadmissible as a matter of law. Rather, the Tax Court determined that the letter, internal correspondence from 1969 between government officials concerning forthcoming changes to the RRSP regime, was irrelevant to the statutory interpretation exercise at hand. The letter did not assist in determining the purpose of subsection 146.2(6), a provision in the separate and unrelated TFSA regime: Reasons at para. 89. We see no reason to interfere with the Tax Court\u2019s determination.\n[16] For these reasons, we will dismiss the appeal, with costs.\n\u201cMonica Biringer\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-69-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nCANADIAN WESTERN TRUST COMPANY AS TRUSTEE OF THE FAREED AHAMED TFSA v.

In 2017, he completed an exam and flight test, and Transport Canada awarded him a Class 4 Flight Instructor Rating. Mr. Khawaja believed he was entitled to a Class 3 Rating. In 2018, he submitted an application to upgrade to a Class 3 Rating, and Transport Canada granted him that upgrade.\n[2] In 2022, Mr. Khawaja filed a statement of claim with the Federal Court concerning Transport Canada\u2019s 2017 decision not to immediately grant him the Class 3. He sought various administrative remedies along with damages of $390,000 for loss of income and $600,000 for pain and suffering. The Federal Court granted an order for summary judgment dismissing Mr. Khawaja\u2019s claim because it was filed after the expiry of the two-year period set out in Alberta\u2019s Limitations Act, RSA 2000, c L-12: Khawaja v. Canada, 2022 FC 1592. Mr. Khawaja appeals this order, asking our Court to reverse the Federal Court\u2019s decision and allow his claim against Transport Canada to proceed.\n[3] The sole issue in this appeal is whether the Federal Court erred in concluding that Mr. Khawaja filed his claim after the two-year limitation period.\n[4] Subsection 3(1) of Alberta\u2019s Limitations Act provides that a defendant is immune from liability if the claimant did not file a claim within two years of the date on which the claimant knew or ought to have known three things: (i) the injury at issue occurred, (ii) the injury was attributable to the defendant\u2019s conduct, and (iii) the injury warrants bringing a proceeding: Canada (Attorney General) v. Utah, 2020 FCA 224 at para. 11. The word \u201cinjury\u201d refers, among other things, to an economic loss, the non-performance of an obligation, or the breach of a duty.\n[5] The Federal Court found as a fact that Mr. Khawaja was aware of these three elements as of April 20, 2017. On that date, he knew Transport Canada was not granting him a Class 3 Rating and that his income would be affected; he even lodged an objection with his Flight Instructor the same day: Federal Court decision at paras. 36\u201341. As Mr. Khawaja acknowledges, our Court can only interfere with this factual finding if the Federal Court committed a palpable and overriding error: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33.\n[6] Mr. Khawaja says the Federal Court committed a palpable and overriding error because the injury in this case was not discoverable until February 3, 2021, when he commenced a proceeding before the Transportation Appeal Tribunal of Canada. Mr. Khawaja argues that, before that date, he remained active by communicating with Transport Canada to ascertain the seriousness of the injury and determine whether his situation warranted bringing a proceeding.\n[7] We must reject Mr. Khawaja\u2019s argument. As determined by the Federal Court, the fact that Mr. Khawaja continued to communicate with Transport Canada does not extend the two-year limitation period. We see no palpable and overriding error in the Federal Court\u2019s reasons.\n[8] Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\"Nathalie Goyette\"\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-260-22\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMANSOOR KHAWAJA v.

In his application, the appellant sought judicial review of two letters from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). In the first, dated July 31, 2017, the CRA requested additional information in respect of the appellant\u2019s Notice of Objection for the 2014 taxation year. In the second, dated May 9, 2023, the CRA replied to correspondence about the appellant\u2019s income tax matters and his appeal to the Tax Court of Canada. The appellant also sought judicial review of a Notice of Confirmation, dated January 17, 2018, disallowing his objection and confirming his income tax assessment for the 2014 taxation year.\n[4] The Motion Judge found that the application is clearly bereft of any chance of success, as it is for all intent and purposes a challenge to the validity of the Minister\u2019s assessment. As such, she determined that the Tax Court has exclusive jurisdiction on such matters pursuant to the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (the ITA), and therefore, that it was not properly before the Federal Court. As for the letters, the Motion Judge found that they were not reviewable decisions or matters within the meaning of section 18.1 of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 (the Act), because they do not affect legal rights, impose legal obligations or cause prejudicial effects: Democracy Watch v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 133 at para. 23, citing Air Canada v. Toronto Port Authority et al., 2011 FCA 347 at para. 29 and Democracy Watch v. Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, 2009 FCA 15 at para. 10.\n[5] Having carefully considered the record, I have not been convinced by the appellant that the Motion Judge made any reviewable errors. As is well established, a decision to strike a pleading is discretionary and can only be set aside if the motion judge committed a palpable and overriding error or an error of law: Michaels of Canada, ULC v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 243 at paras. 2\u20135; Sagos v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FCA 47 at paras. 2\u20134. The Motion Judge stated the correct legal test on a motion to strike and properly relied on JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc., according to which a moving party must demonstrate that the application is \u201cso clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success\u201d, such that there must be \u201can obvious, fatal flaw striking at the root of this Court\u2019s power to entertain the application\u201d: JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc. v. Canada (National Revenue), 2013 FCA 250 at para. 47.\n[6] Nor did the Motion Judge make any palpable and overriding error in applying the legal test to the facts of this case. At its root, the appellant disagrees with the Minister\u2019s income tax assessment for the year 2014. While the Minister determined that the severance pay he received from his employer must be included as taxable income, the appellant contends that it is rather a lump sum payment in the settlement of a human rights violation and that it is therefore non-taxable income. Such a disagreement with respect to an income tax assessment clearly falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court of Canada, pursuant to section 18.5 of the Act, section 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-2, and section 169 of the ITA.\n[7] As for the two letters, they are clearly not reviewable decisions as they did not affect the appellant\u2019s legal rights, imposed no legal obligation, and caused no prejudicial effects. The July 31, 2017 letter simply requested further documents from the appellant to support his position, whereas the May 9, 2023 letter from the Assistant Commissioner of the CRA\u2019s appeal branch is a courtesy letter providing the appellant with information about his ongoing appeal, as held by the Motion Judge.\n[8] Finally, I can find no reviewable error in the decision of the Motion Judge to admit into evidence certain paragraphs of the affidavit (with three exhibits appended to it) of a litigation officer in the Appeals Division of the CRA\u2019s Tax Law Services Office. Such a decision is subject to the standard of correctness, to the extent that the alleged error relates to the applicable legal test and principles: Sweet Productions Inc. v. Licensing LP International S.\u00c0.R.L., 2022 FCA 111 at para. 22. The appellant does not submit that the Motion Judge erred in identifying the correct legal principles, nor has he raised any palpable and overriding error in applying them. Some of the paragraphs admitted merely serve to append as exhibits the letters referenced by the appellant in his Notice of Application, while others provide uncontroversial background information.\n[9] As for the Charter arguments raised by the appellant, they cannot be entertained before this Court as they were not pursued before the Motion Judge. Moreover, there is no evidentiary record to support them, and, in any event, it is too late to substantiate them on appeal.\n[10] For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal, with costs in the amount of $2,000 all inclusive.\n\u201cYves de Montigny\u201d\nChief Justice\n\u201cI agree.\nRen\u00e9 LeBlanc J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nElizabeth Walker J.A.\u201d\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDocket:\nA-195-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nDAWIT TUQUABO v.

Introduction [1] Based on confidential security information and other information, the Minister had reasonable grounds to suspect that the appellants would travel by air to commit a terrorism offence. Thus, acting under the Secure Air Travel Act, S.C. 2015, c. 20, s. 11, the Minister decided to place the appellants on a list, sometimes colloquially but erroneously called a \u201cno-fly list\u201d.\n[2] Placement on the list does not trigger any immediate consequences. Rather, it creates potential consequences. Each time a person on the list tries to fly, the Minister decides whether a direction to an air carrier should be made concerning the listed person (s. 9(1)). Directions can range from enhanced security screening for the listed person at the airport to prohibiting the person from flying. This scheme allows the Minister to regulate flyers on the list using all available information at the time they try to fly, not just the information available at the time of listing.\n[3] At some point, the appellants tried to fly. They could not. They were on the list and the Minister had directed that they not fly.\n[4] Under the Act, after being denied transportation, the appellants can ask the Minister to de-list them (s. 15). De-listing prevents any directions concerning future flights. Here, the appellants asked the Minister for de-listing. The Minister refused and kept the appellants on the list.\n[5] After the Minister maintains the listing, the appellants can appeal to the Federal Court to review the listing decision \u201cwithout delay\u201d based on the information available to the Court (ss. 16(2) and 16(4)). Here, the appellants did just that:\nThe appellant Dulai submitted that the Act and the Minister\u2019s listing decision unjustifiably violated s. 6 of the Charter (mobility rights).\nBoth appellants submitted that ss. 15 and 16 of the Act and the Minister\u2019s listing decisions unjustifiably violated s. 7 of the Charter, in particular the rights to liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with fundamental justice.\nBoth appellants submitted that the Minister\u2019s listing decisions were unreasonable and should be quashed.\n[6] In comprehensive, careful and detailed reasons, the Federal Court disagreed with the appellants (2022 FC 1163, 2022 FC 1164 and 2022 FC 1168; see also 2020 FC 729). The Federal Court held that:\nSection 8 and para. 9(1)(a) of the Secure Air Travel Act and the Minister\u2019s decision offended Mr. Dulai\u2019s mobility rights under s. 6(1) and para. 6(2)(b) of the Charter (2022 FC 1168 at paras. 76-108) but the Act and the Minister\u2019s decision were justified under s. 1 of the Charter (2022 FC 1168 at paras. 109-137).\nSections 15 and 16 of the Secure Air Travel Act and the Minister\u2019s decisions deprived the appellants of their security of the person rights under s. 7 of the Charter but did so in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice (2022 FC 1168 at paras. 186-191 and 226-229); and in this case, all procedures were conducted in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\nThe Minister\u2019s decisions to maintain the appellants on the list were reasonable (2022 FC 1163 and 2022 FC 1164).\n[7] The appellants now appeal to this Court on all issues.\nB. Analysis (1) The Charter issues [8] The respondent submits that neither the provisions of the Act nor the placement of the appellants on the list offends their mobility rights within or to and from Canada under s. 6 of the Charter. Among other things, the respondent submits that s. 6 does not protect rights to a mode of transport. The respondent adds that neither the provisions of the Act nor the placement of the appellants on the list offends the appellants\u2019 rights to liberty and security of the person under s. 7 because the appellants have suffered only some inconvenience with the running of their businesses and psychological stress, not serious harm of a medical nature.\n[9] It is unnecessary to decide upon the respondent\u2019s submissions and, more generally, whether the Secure Air Travel Act violates the appellants\u2019 mobility rights under s. 6 of the Charter or rights to liberty and security of the person under s. 7 of the Charter.\n[10] Legislation that violates s. 6 of the Charter can be justified as a reasonable limit prescribed by law under s. 1. And deprivations of the rights to liberty and security of the person under s. 7 of the Charter can be in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. As explained below, to the extent s. 8 and para. 9(1)(a) of the Secure Air Travel Act violate s. 6 of the Charter, they are justified under s. 1. And to the extent ss. 15 and 16 of the Act deprive the appellants of rights to liberty or security of the person under s. 7 of the Charter, the deprivation is in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\n[11] In a future case, both the Federal Court and this Court should regard the ss. 6 and 7 issues in this case as open to full argument. There is reason to doubt the correctness of the Federal Court\u2019s view that Mr. Dulai\u2019s s. 6 rights were infringed because the Federal Court may have departed from the accepted approach for interpreting the Charter in general and s. 6 of the Charter in particular: Quebec (Attorney General) v. 9147-0732 Qu\u00e9bec Inc., 2020 SCC 32, [2020] 3 S.C.R. 426 at paras. 8-18; Canadian Egg Marketing Agency v. Richardson, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 157, 166 D.L.R. (4th) 1 at paras. 49-92; Canada v. Boloh 1(a), 2023 FCA 120 at paras. 14-51. And there is reason to doubt the correctness of the Federal Court\u2019s finding of a rights breach under s. 7 because of the high quality and rare nature of the evidence needed in this context to establish a breach: New Brunswick (Minister of Health and Community Services) v. G. (J.), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 46, 177 D.L.R. (4th) 124 at paras. 59-60; Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307 at paras. 47-57.\n(a) Section 6 of the Charter and justification under section 1 of the Charter [12] For argument\u2019s sake, I am prepared to assume that s. 6 of the Charter has been violated. However, the Act is justified under s. 1. I substantially agree with the Federal Court\u2019s reasons on all of the branches of the test for justification under s. 1 and I adopt those reasons.\n[13] All parties agree that the objectives of the Secure Air Travel Act, including para. 8(1)(b) and s. 9(1), are to protect Canadians when they fly, uphold national security, and fulfil Canada\u2019s international obligations to counter terrorism. All agree that these are pressing and substantial objectives.\n[14] As well, all parties agree that the Secure Air Travel Act rationally connects to these objectives: the Minister can place individuals on the list where the Minister has reasonable grounds to suspect they will threaten transportation security or travel by air to commit a terrorism offence.\n[15] However, the parties part company on the minimal impairment branch of the justification test. The appellants submit that the Secure Air Travel Act violates mobility rights in a non-minimal way. I disagree. In the assessment of minimal impairment or, for that matter, the proportionality between the benefits of the Act and its deleterious effects, context matters.\n[16] In some cases, Parliament is addressing a concrete and tangible problem within the ken of the courts. As a result, in those sorts of cases, courts feel confident, empowered and institutionally capable to second-guess Parliament\u2019s choices. They can hold Parliament to the option that is the very least impairing of rights and freedoms: Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, 58 D.L.R. (4th) 577 at 994 S.C.R.\n[17] In other cases, Parliament is addressing a more abstract and intangible problem outside the ken of the courts. As a result, courts\u2014though still duty-bound to be vigilant in the protection of rights and freedoms\u2014must necessarily give Parliament some leeway. In these sorts of cases, courts often speak of Parliament having a reasonable range of available alternatives to accomplish its purposes, a margin of appreciation or a measure of deference: Mounted Police Association of Ontario v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 1, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 3 at para. 149; Alberta v. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 567 at para. 53; RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 199, 127 D.L.R. (4th) 1 at paras. 63 and 68-70; Irwin Toy at 989-990 and 993-994; and many others.\n[18] The Secure Air Travel Act is just the sort of legislation where Parliament must be given a margin of appreciation. Here, Parliament is acting in the fields of national security, international relations and global cooperation to prevent terrorism. These are fields full of sensitive, imprecise and complex assessments, evaluations and choices lying within the experience, knowledge and judgment of Parliament and the executive of government empowered under the Act, not judges and courts: Boloh 1(a) at paras. 64-65; Canada (Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities) v. Farwaha, 2014 FCA 56, [2015] 2 F.C.R. 1006 at para. 94. As well, the Act is not directed to past events that are tangible, certain and known. Rather, it is forward-looking, designed to act preventatively, proactively and pre-emptively to deal with perhaps imprecise but nevertheless very real risks of harm to property, public safety and human life. Here, exactitude is elusive. The stakes are sky-high. Some leeway is warranted.\n[19] The Secure Air Travel Act meets the requirement of minimal impairment. Several of its features show careful tailoring to minimize the impairment of rights and freedoms: after placement on the list, individuals are not automatically denied boarding but instead may or may not be subject to a direction; if subject to a direction, individuals may be subject to gradual and proportional measures such as additional security screening (s. 9); any listing decisions must be re-evaluated every 90 days using the most current available information (s. 8(2)); and when individuals seek to have their name removed, the Minister must review the listing decisions anew (s. 15(4)). Further protection is provided by a neutral, thorough judicial assessment in the Federal Court \u201cwithout delay\u201d of the Minister\u2019s decisions based on all the evidence, including any new, up-to-date evidence (s. 16(4) and para. 16(6)(e)). And as we shall see, the Act also leaves it open to the Federal Court to take all possible measures to protect the individual\u2019s rights to disclosure, to know the case to meet, and to make full answer and defence, such as by appointing an amicus curiae to protect the individual\u2019s interests in any closed proceedings.\n[20] The appellants submit that the Secure Air Travel Act could accomplish its objectives with less intrusion by simply revoking individuals\u2019 Canadian passports. I disagree. Domestic air travel could still occur and individuals can still fly abroad using foreign passports.\n[21] In this case, it is noteworthy that the appellants and the amici curiae have not been able to offer any effective ways by which Parliament could have accomplished the important objectives furthered by the Secure Air Travel Act in a less impairing way. Nor can I. The Act meets the requirement of minimal impairment.\n[22] Finally, justification under s. 1 of the Charter also requires an overall balance or proportionality between the benefits of the Act and its deleterious effects. Here, this requirement is met. The deleterious effects are relatively few, ranging from the potential of enhanced screening to a flying ban\u2014measures that might be only temporary and brief\u2014and pale next to the need to prevent domestic and international terrorism, and the destruction, butchery and carnage wrought by it.\n[23] The decision to list the appellants also does not violate s. 6 of the Charter. Here again, it is only necessary to consider s. 1. To the extent the decision violated the appellants\u2019 mobility rights, the listing was demonstrably reasonable under s. 1. The analysis mirrors the analysis, below, of the reasonableness of the Minister\u2019s listing decision. On the facts and the law, this was not a close case: see paragraphs 44-73 below.\n(b) Section 7 of the Charter and the principles of fundamental justice [24] Here again, I substantially agree with the Federal Court, for the reasons it gave. Any deprivation of the appellants\u2019 s. 7 rights to liberty and security of the person was in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. I adopt the Federal Court\u2019s reasons on this point.\n[25] The scheme under the Secure Air Travel Act is quite similar to the security certificate scheme established under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27. Both are prompted by national security and public safety concerns. Both prescribe or permit rigorous measures and mechanisms to give affected individuals as much procedural fairness as possible in the circumstances. For example, just like those in security certificate proceedings under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, individuals placed on the list under the Secure Air Travel Act are entitled, among other things, to reasonable disclosure of the case against them, a fair hearing presided by an independent and impartial judge, and independent, neutral decisions based on the facts and the law: Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 SCC 9, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 350 (\u201cCharkaoui 2007\u201d) at para. 29; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Harkat, 2014 SCC 37, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 33 at paras. 40-44.\n[26] When confidential security information is in play, as it is here, the interests of individuals placed on the list under the Secure Air Travel Act can be represented in closed security hearings by an amicus curiae, with a role almost identical to the \u201cspecial advocates\u201d who represent affected individuals in closed security hearings under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The involvement of an amicus curiae ensures the protection of the appellants\u2019 right to know the case against them and their right to answer it: Harkat at paras. 28-77.\n[27] The Supreme Court has ruled the procedural protections in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, including the use of special advocates, to be constitutionally sufficient: Harkat at para. 77. Given the substantially similar protections under the Secure Air Travel Act and the ability of the Federal Court to make use of amici curiae, the same result must follow.\n[28] This is especially so given the lesser consequences that affected individuals face as a result of listing under the Secure Air Travel Act: a range of measures ranging from enhanced security screening to a ban on flying, perhaps only temporary and brief, and perhaps no measures at all. While these measures can greatly affect some, they pale in comparison to the consequences affected individuals face in security certificate proceedings under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act: permanent removal from Canada or indefinite detention.\n[29] The appellants point to the fact that unlike security certificate proceedings under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Secure Air Travel Act does not explicitly provide for the involvement of an amicus curiae or a special advocate to access confidential security information and represent the interests of affected persons in closed proceedings. The Secure Air Travel Act merely leaves open the possibility that an amicus curiae might be appointed. This, the appellants say, is a fatal procedural shortcoming in the Act, one that is contrary to the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7. They say that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Charkaoui 2007 supports their position. I disagree.\n[30] The Secure Air Travel Act allows the Federal Court the flexibility to tailor its procedures to the particular circumstances to meet the requirements of procedural fairness and the principles of fundamental justice. Flexibility is needed because the circumstances giving rise to placement on the list under the Secure Air Travel Act vary considerably and confidential security information may not be in issue:\nAt one end is placement on the list based only on publicly available information. There, the Federal Court\u2019s hearing can be public and an affected individual\u2019s counsel can participate fully. An amicus curiae to represent the interests of the individual is not needed.\nAt the other end is placement on the list based in whole or in part on confidential security evidence. There, an amicus curiae to represent the interests of the individual may be needed.\n[31] This is quite unlike security certificate proceedings under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act where, due to the nature of the proceeding and the specific standards set out in the Act, confidential security information will be pervasive. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act provides that highly sensitive \u201csecurity or criminal intelligence information and information that is obtained in confidence from a source in Canada, the government of a foreign state, an international organization of states or an institution of such a government or international organization\u201d (s. 76) is to be used to prove inadmissibility or to prove the need for detention, continued detention or variation of detention (ss. 82-82.2). Given the pervasiveness of the confidential security information, it makes sense that the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act has to expressly provide for special advocates to receive that information and represent the interests of affected individuals.\n[32] That is not all. In Charkaoui 2007 (at para. 60), the Supreme Court highlighted the drastic consequences of security certificate proceedings under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\u2014potential removal from Canada or indefinite detention\u2014and held that those consequences required the highest of procedural protections under s. 7 of the Charter. Thus, in Charkaoui 2007, the Supreme Court held (at paras. 80-84) that the Act could specifically set out the protective mechanism of special advocates to represent the interests of affected individuals.\n[33] However, in words apposite to the present case, the Supreme Court added (at paras. 57-59) that procedural protections under s. 7 of the Charter need not be as high in other contexts where the consequences are less drastic.\n[34] That is the case here. As noted at paragraph 28 above, the consequences of listing under the Secure Air Travel Act\u2014a range of measures ranging from enhanced security screening to a ban on flying, perhaps only temporary and brief, and perhaps no measures at all\u2014are far less drastic than those in security certificate proceedings under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[35] Accordingly, in this case, it is not constitutionally incumbent on Parliament to require the use of an amicus curiae to protect the affected individual\u2019s interests in every case arising under the Secure Air Travel Act. Instead, the Secure Air Travel Act leaves it up to the Federal Court to decide what is necessary in the circumstances.\n[36] Is there anything we should be concerned about here? No. Under many legislative regimes and in many hearings and processes in our legal system, it is left to judges to devise and implement protective procedures based on the particular circumstances that present themselves: see, e.g., R. v. Ahmad, 2011 SCC 6, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 110 at para. 40 and sensitive proceedings under legislation such as the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5 and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-23. And there is no gap in protection. If the Federal Court fails to devise and implement any necessary protective procedures while operating under this particular legislative regime, for example by not appointing an amicus curiae when one is needed to protect an affected individual\u2019s interests, this Court will quash its decision.\n[37] For the foregoing reasons, ss. 15 and 16 of the Secure Air Travel Act are consistent with the principles of fundamental justice.\n[38] However, we must now examine what actually happened in this case. Did the appellants enjoy the benefit of the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the Charter? Were they treated in a procedurally fair and adequate way?\n[39] The answer to both is yes. The Federal Court played a robust and active role throughout in ensuring that the appellants were treated in a procedurally fair way:\nThe Federal Court recognized that this particular case involved confidential security information. So it appointed two well-qualified, experienced lawyers to serve as amici curiae to advance the appellants\u2019 interests in the confidential portions of the hearings dealing with that information. The Federal Court gave the amici curiae a broad mandate, nearly identical to \u201cspecial advocates\u201d in security certificate proceedings under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and they discharged that mandate thoroughly. The appointment of persons like this is a substantial substitute to full disclosure in sensitive cases involving confidential and classified national security evidence, and essential to ensure fairness: Harkat at paras. 34-37, 46-47, and 67-73. Given the extent and quality of the participation of the amicus curiae in the present case (see 2020 FC 729 at para. 217 and the resulting order issued by the Federal Court), the appellants\u2019 interests were represented and advanced very well.\nThe Federal Court played an active, robust, interventionist, non-deferential, gatekeeper role in ensuring procedural fairness throughout, in particular by giving the appellants full disclosure or a substantial substitute to full disclosure in the form of in-depth analyses and high-quality, very detailed public summaries. In doing so, the Federal Court ensured the appellants received an \u201cincompressible minimum amount of disclosure\u201d and discharged the requirement under para. 16(6)(c) of the Secure Air Travel Act to keep the appellants reasonably informed: Charkaoui 2007 at paras. 61-63; Harkat at paras. 40-44 and 51-64.\n[40] Having examined the unredacted confidential security information, I conclude without hesitation that the Federal Court disclosed as much as it could to the appellants and to the amici curiae, mindful of its obligation not to allow disclosure if, in its opinion, it would be injurious to national safety or endanger the safety of any person (para. 16(6)(c)). The appellants themselves, or through the amici curiae representing their interests, had sufficient information to know the case to meet and to make full answer and defence. The Federal Court was so satisfied: 2022 FC 1163 at para. 126; 2022 FC 1164 at para. 124; 2022 FC 1168 at para. 222. This is a finding that can be set aside only on the basis of palpable and overriding error\u2014an obvious error capable of changing the outcome\u2014and none has been shown here.\n[41] The appellants submit that the amici curiae in this case could not represent their interests adequately, citing Ontario v. Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association of Ontario, 2013 SCC 43, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 3 at para. 49. I disagree. Criminal Lawyers stands for the proposition that a court cannot give an amicus curiae a mandate that obliges them to take on a solicitor-client role. That didn\u2019t happen here. Instead, the amici curiae were appointed to represent the appellants\u2019 interests to the fullest extent possible by serving as a substantial substitute for the appellants\u2019 full participation in the confidential portion of the proceedings and full disclosure of confidential material. This salutary procedure is regularly followed in national security proceedings, with demonstrably beneficial results: 2020 FC 729 at paras. 157-177. In this case, the amici curiae represented the appellants\u2019 interests fully and effectively. The Federal Court so found. That finding is not vitiated by palpable and overriding error.\n[42] For nearly forty years, the Supreme Court has repeatedly reminded us that s. 7 of the Charter guarantees those facing state-run proceedings \u201cadequate\u201d procedural fairness, not \u201cthe most favourable procedures that could possibly be imagined\u201d: R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, 44 D.L.R. (4th) 193 at para. 88; in the national security context, see also Harkat at para. 43 and Ruby v. Canada (Solicitor General), 2002 SCC 75, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 3 at para. 46.\n[43] In the present case, knowing what was disclosed to the appellants and the amici curiae, considering the activities of the amici curiae in reviewing the confidential evidence and making submissions on it, and taking into account the exceptional vigilance of the Federal Court in ensuring procedural fairness throughout, I conclude that the procedures followed were not just adequate. They were well beyond adequate.\n(2) The reasonableness of the Minister\u2019s decisions to maintain the appellants\u2019 listing [44] The Minister placed the appellants on the list under the Secure Air Travel Act and, following submissions from the appellants, maintained them on the list. The Federal Court upheld the Minister\u2019s decisions. The appellants now ask this Court to reverse the decision of the Federal Court and quash the Minister\u2019s decisions.\n[45] In order to maintain a person on the list, the Minister must have \u201creasonable grounds to suspect\u201d the person would either threaten transportation security or travel by air to commit a terrorism offence (s. 8).\n[46] The \u201creasonable grounds to suspect\u201d standard speaks to rational possibilities, not likelihoods. This distinguishes it from the higher standard of \u201creasonable and probable grounds\u201d. Nevertheless, \u201creasonable grounds to suspect\u201d is a standard that must be articulated and applied with discipline and rigor. Only then can a reviewing court conduct \u201can independent after-the-fact review\u201d and stop any \u201carbitrary state action\u201d in its tracks. See R. v. Chehil, 2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220 at para. 45.\n[47] Imaginings, musings, hunches, speculations or guesses, educated or otherwise, do not meet the standard. Rather, the standard is met through evidence and inferences drawn from evidence that create a constellation of objective, discernable and ascertainable facts. The evidence and inferences must tie the relevant individuals, here the appellants, to the relevant circumstance, here the travelling by air to commit a terrorism offence. There need not be verifiable and reliable proof. See R. v. Mann, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59 at paras. 23-45; R. v. Kang-Brown, 2008 SCC 18, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 456; R. v. Monney, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 652, 171 D.L.R. (4th) 1 at paras. 49-52; Farwaha at paras. 96-98.\n[48] In an appeal to the Federal Court, the Federal Court decides whether the Minister\u2019s listing of the person is \u201creasonable\u201d (s. 16(4)), i.e., tenable and defensible given the evidence and the degree of impact upon the individual. The Federal Court can receive new evidence, including more up-to-date evidence (para. 16(6)(e)). Where the Federal Court receives new evidence, it decides whether the Minister\u2019s decision is reasonable in light of the totality of the evidence placed before the Court.\n[49] On appeal from the Federal Court to this Court, the appellants must show that the Federal Court erred in law or extricable legal principle or, on other issues, committed palpable and overriding error. This is the normal appellate standard: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235; Harkat at para. 108.\n[50] The Federal Court charged itself properly on the meaning of \u201creasonable\u201d in s. 16(4), the standard of \u201creasonable grounds to suspect\u201d in s. 8, the nature of the record before the Court and the robust, interventionist, non-deferential, gatekeeper role that the Court must play to protect the appellants\u2019 interests: 2022 FC 1163 at paras. 85-88; 2022 FC 1164 at paras. 81-84; 2020 FC 729 at paras. 53, 116-119 and 126-127; Brar v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2021 FC 932 at paras. 68-69.\n[51] The amici curiae submit that the Federal Court cannot use new evidence adduced under para. 16(6)(e) of the Secure Air Travel Act when considering whether the \u201creasonable grounds to suspect\u201d standard was met. They say that the Federal Court should have limited its review of the Minister\u2019s decision to the evidence that was before the decision-maker. In part, they base this submission on their view that the Federal Court is engaged in a judicial review of the Minister\u2019s decision to maintain the appellants on the list, much like it would review the decision of any other administrative decision-maker. Thus, in their view, all the normal rules in judicial review apply, many of which are set out in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653.\n[52] I reject this submission. So did the Federal Court: 2020 FC 729 at paras. 117-119. I adopt the reasons of the Federal Court and add the following.\n[53] The Federal Court\u2019s review of the Minister\u2019s decisions to maintain the appellants on the list under the Secure Air Travel Act is analogous to its review of the Ministers\u2019 decision to issue a security certificate against an individual under s. 78 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and to a Minister\u2019s decision to cancel a passport under s. 4 of the Prevention of Terrorist Travel Act, S.C. 2015, c. 36, s. 42. Review in the Federal Court in these regimes is not traditional judicial review of the sort regulated by Vavilov.\n[54] The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that security certificate proceedings in the Federal Court under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act are not judicial review proceedings governed by the normal methodology for reviewing substantive decision-making in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190 or its successor, Vavilov: Charkaoui v. Canada, 2008 SCC 38, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 326 (\u201cCharkaoui 2008\u201d); Harkat. The same must be true here.\n[55] This makes sense. None of the three regimes, identified above, deals with a decision that has finally resolved the merits of a matter and cannot be reopened. None looks backward, examining matters that are finished and settled. None has an evidentiary record that has been settled once and for all and cannot be supplemented in the reviewing court.\n[56] Instead, all are special, forward-looking regimes aimed not at crystallizing what happened in the past but rather preventing future harm. All recognize that future harm may be better defined by new information. All can be based on security information that, by its nature, is ever-evolving. All aim at ensuring that restrictive, deleterious and potentially rights-impairing consequences are visited upon individuals only using the most up-to-date, current information. Thus, all allow for the admission of new evidence in the Federal Court. This works both ways: the new evidence can enhance the state\u2019s case or weaken it.\n[57] The amici curiae also submit that in the Federal Court the respondent introduced far too much new evidence, making the process less of a judicial review of the Minister\u2019s decision and more like a de novo determination by the Federal Court. I disagree for two reasons.\n[58] First, as just explained, the Federal Court is not deciding a judicial review of the Minister\u2019s decision that is over and done with. Rather, it is assessing whether the decision to maintain the appellants\u2019 listing continues to be reasonable on the basis of all evidence, including the most up-to-date evidence available.\n[59] Second, I am not persuaded that by introducing new evidence the respondent committed any abuse of process or engaged in a process contrary to the framework of the Secure Air Travel Act of the sort described in Charkaoui 2008. There, the Supreme Court recognized (at para. 71) that the state could abuse the security certificate regime under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act if it intentionally submitted an incomplete record to the Ministers to get a security certificate and then, after the security certificate was issued and the affected individual was arrested and detained, continued to accumulate evidence to bolster, bootstrap, or backfill its case for the certificate. Here, the respondent is doing nothing of the sort. Much of the new evidence the respondent introduced was in response to new evidence understandably introduced by the appellants and the amici curiae, in part due to disclosure they received. And the new evidence was necessary to ensure that the Federal Court assessed the reasonableness of the maintenance of the appellants on the list using the most up-to-date evidence available.\n[60] The amici curiae also submit that the requirement that there be reasonable grounds to suspect that the listed individual will commit a terrorism offence listed under para. 8(1)(b) of the Secure Air Travel Act is quite demanding. The Minister must have in mind a particular offence, perhaps even the individual elements of the offence, look at the words and conduct of the listed individual, and then assess whether there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the offence with its elements will be committed.\n[61] The Secure Air Travel Act does not so provide. Paragraph 8(1)(b) of the Act requires the Minister to have reasonable grounds to suspect that the individual will travel by air for the purpose of committing acts or omissions that are offences under that paragraph of the Act. The focus in para. 8(1)(b) is on whether there are reasonable grounds, established by a constellation of information of the quality discussed in paragraphs 46-47 above, that the statements, actions, and behaviours of the individual are such that it is possible, not probable, that the individual will travel by air for the purpose of committing acts or omissions that are offences under para. 8(1)(b) of the Act. Under this view, a person who openly declares support for certain terrorist action and has the means and motivation to carry it out might be listed. Under the view of the amici curiae that same person perhaps might not be listed because of the particular state of current information bearing on the particular elements of the offence. The former view better advances the purposes of the Act. To similar effect, see Farwaha at para. 78 and Randhawa v. Canada (Transport), 2017 FC 556.\n[62] Some of the submissions of the amici curiae suggest that the offences listed under para. 8(1)(b) of the Secure Air Travel Act are rather exacting and narrow. I disagree. The offences have been interpreted to be broad and to encompass a broad range of conduct: see, e.g., R. v. Khawaja, 2012 SCC 69, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 555 at para. 12; R. v. Nutall, 2018 BCCA 479 at para. 216; R. v. Ahmad, (2009), 257 C.C.C. (3d) 199 (Ont. S.C.) at paras. 26 and 59-61. In this regard, I agree with the submissions of the respondent at paragraphs 51-61 of the redacted public version of its ex parte memorandum of fact and law.\n[63] The appellants submit that the Federal Court\u2019s public reasons do not permit meaningful appellate review. I reject this. The public reasons, exacting and voluminous, provide this Court with more than enough information to conduct a meaningful appellate review, especially viewed in light of the public and confidential evidence filed. Further, the Federal Court\u2019s public reasons, seen in light of the public evidence and the public disclosures of the confidential proceedings, easily pass the threshold of informing the appellants of what the Federal Court decided and why: R. v. R.E.M., 2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3 at para. 17.\n[64] In dismissing the appellants\u2019 appeals in this case, the Federal Court found that the evidence supporting the placement of the appellants on the list was more than sufficient in quantity and quality to meet the statutory standard of \u201creasonable grounds to suspect\u201d. The Federal Court found that it was reasonable for the Minister to form a reasonable suspicion that both appellants would travel by air for the purpose of committing one of the broad range of terrorism offences identified in para. 8(1)(b) of the Secure Air Travel Act. These findings stand: the appellants have not shown any error of law or palpable and overriding error. In fact, on the evidence, I agree with the Federal Court\u2019s findings.\n[65] The appellants also submit that the Federal Court (and the Minister for that matter) failed to consider the appellants\u2019 \u201cCharter values\u201d, in particular the values surrounding ss. 2, 6, and 7 of the Charter, or, alternatively, considered them improperly: Dor\u00e9 v. Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec, 2012 SCC 12, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 395; Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest v. Northwest Territories (Education, Culture and Employment), 2023 SCC 31.\n[66] In its cases, the Supreme Court says that \u201cCharter values\u201d are just factors for administrators to take into account in their decision-making. They do not change, supplement or override the written text of the rights and freedoms in the Charter, the written justification provision in s. 1 of the Charter, or the cases decided under the Charter during the past forty-three years. Nor are they putty to be used to fill unwanted gaps in the Charter. Still less can they strike down or change legislation governing an administrator\u2019s decision, or authorize an administrative decision not authorized by the governing legislation: Tranchemontagne v. Ontario (Director, Disability Support Program), 2006 SCC 14, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 513 at para. 16; Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, 59 D.L.R. (4th) 416 at 1077-1081 S.C.R. Lastly, if \u201cCharter values\u201d are to be matters of constitutional import, they must be substantial, well-founded and well-sourced, not just a litigant\u2019s musings about the vibe of the thing. On a number of these points, see Sullivan v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 7 at paras. 9-12 and see also Khodykin v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 96 at paras. 8-9.\n[67] Here, the appellants do not misuse Charter values in the ways just described. However, the values they do articulate suffer from poor definition and vagueness. To the extent the values have the same content as the rights and freedoms under the Charter that the appellants have invoked in this case, I have already found justification under s. 1 of the Charter and consistency with the principles of fundamental justice. And overall, the appellants seem to be using Charter values in this case as a vehicle to quibble about the weight the Minister and the Federal Court gave to certain considerations the appellants wish to stress\u2014an argument foreclosed to them given the standard of review of palpable and overriding error.\n[68] In this case, the record, both public and confidential, including the appellants\u2019 submissions, shows that when the Minister and the Federal Court assessed the reasonableness of the listing, they were well aware of the rights, freedoms and interests of the appellants, including anything that might conceivably qualify as \u201cCharter values\u201d. But they were also aware of the public and confidential evidence, the need to continue the international fight against terrorism, and the imperatives of public safety. In this case, the balance fell in favour of maintaining the listing of the appellants, decidedly so. Here, the Federal Court did not commit any legal error or palpable and overriding error.\n[69] In the course of oral argument in this Court, the appellants raised a new issue for the first time. They queried whether a court could ever review Ministerial directions under s. 9 of the Secure Air Travel Act.\n[70] As noted above (at paragraph 2), the Minister\u2019s listing decisions do not cause any immediate consequences for persons on the list. Instead, they create only the potential of a Ministerial direction to an air carrier against a listed person that becomes relevant at the time of flying based on the information then available. The Act provides no recourse against a Ministerial direction, for example by way of judicial review (with potentially fast interim emergency remedies, as discussed in Wilson v. Meeches, 2023 FCA 233), likely because the direction may be made moments before the time of flying. Is a judicial review legally and practically available to redress a Ministerial direction on the basis of Yatar v. TD Insurance Meloche Monnex, 2024 SCC 8, 489 D.L.R. (4th) 191? On the other hand, as the respondent suggests, is recourse against the Minister\u2019s listing decision sufficient? These questions need a full evidentiary record and full argument, which we do not have here. We should not comment further: Quan v. Cusson, 2009 SCC 62, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 712 at para. 36; Performance Industries Ltd. v. Sylvan Lake Golf & Tennis Club Ltd., 2002 SCC 19, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 678 at paras. 32-34.\n[71] I do wish to close by commenting on the confidential hearing that this Court conducted with the amici curiae and the respondent to consider the confidential security evidence offered in support of the appellants\u2019 listings. The confidential hearing took place soon after all parties participated in a public hearing. As much business as possible was conducted in the public hearing. The public hearing was far longer than the confidential hearing.\n[72] In this case, confidential reasons dealing with the confidential evidence and confidential submissions are not necessary. As a result, these public reasons deal with all of the issues in this appeal. This is because the amici curiae did not try to argue in the confidential hearing that the Federal Court committed palpable and overriding error in finding that:\nmany of the appellants\u2019 explanations and justifications were not credible;\nthere were reasonable grounds to suspect the appellants might travel by air for the purpose of committing acts or omissions that are offences under para. 8(1)(b) of the Secure Air Travel Act; and\nthe evidence before the Federal Court was sufficient in quality and quantity and was sufficiently reliable to support maintaining the appellants on the list (see, in particular, the respondent\u2019s confidential memorandum of fact and law, in particular at paras. 76-77 and 81-82).\n[73] The amici curiae were right not to try. Looking at all the evidence, close this case was not.\nC. Proposed disposition [74] For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appellants\u2019 appeals. The respondent does not seek its costs and so none should be awarded.\n\u201cDavid Stratas\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nRichard Boivin J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nMonica Biringer J.A.\u201d\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKETS:\nA-213-22\nA-217-22\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nBHAGAT SINGH BRAR AND PARVKAR SINGH DULAI v.

She was an indeterminate public service employee, and was not a member of a union. Ms. Davis is also a person with disabilities.\n[2] In 2018, Ms. Davis filed a complaint with the RCMP\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Harassment Complaints, alleging that her supervisor had subjected her to harassment and bullying for several years. An Assistant Commissioner of the RCMP issued a 65-page \u201cRecord of Decision\u201d with respect to Ms. Davis\u2019 complaint, finding that, on a balance of probabilities, the complaint had not been substantiated, and that her supervisor had not contravened the RCMP\u2019s Code of Conduct.\n[3] Ms. Davis grieved the Assistant Commissioner\u2019s decision, alleging that he was not impartial and that he failed to consider all of the information in front of him before dismissing her complaint. By agreement of the parties, Ms. Davis\u2019 grievance was referred directly to the third level of the grievance process. The RCMP\u2019s Chief Human Resources Officer subsequently dismissed Ms. Davis\u2019 grievance, finding no evidence to support her claims.\n[4] In accordance with subsection 209(1) of the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22 (the FPSLRA or the Act), only certain matters that may be grieved by public servants can be referred to adjudication before the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board: Adelberg v. Canada, 2024 FCA 106 at para. 31 (Adelberg FCA). Dealing as it did with the terms and conditions of her employment, Ms. Davis\u2019 individual grievance was not one that could be referred to adjudication.\n[5] Ms. Davis instead sought judicial review of the Chief Human Resources Officer\u2019s decision in the Federal Court, seeking to quash both the Record of Decision and the Grievance Decision on the basis of bias and procedural unfairness. Ms. Davis also sought to quash the investigation into her complaints, and claimed compensatory, aggravated and punitive damages. However, Ms. Davis discontinued her application for judicial review prior to it being heard.\nI. Ms. Davis\u2019 Statement of Claim [6] Shortly after discontinuing her application for judicial review, Ms. Davis filed a statement of claim in the Federal Court naming the RCMP as the defendant. Ms. Davis\u2019 statement of claim relates to many of the events that gave rise to her harassment complaint and grievance, as well as events surrounding the investigation and determination of her complaint.\n[7] Ms. Davis\u2019 statement of claim asserts that the RCMP had engaged in a series of unfair labour practices that included harassment by her supervisor, unilateral changes to her employment contract, disguised and\/or constructive dismissal, harm to her reputation and discrimination based on the failure of the RCMP to accommodate her disability. She further alleged that the RCMP had failed to investigate her allegations properly, and that the investigation and hearing processes were fraught with procedural unfairness.\n[8] By way of relief, Ms. Davis sought, amongst other things, to have the Court quash the grievance decision \u201cdue to the lack of impartiality and procedural unfairness\u201d. She also sought compensatory, general and aggravated damages.\n[9] The RCMP brought a motion to strike Ms. Davis\u2019 statement of claim, without leave to amend, on the basis that her claim was barred by operation of subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA. Subsection 236(1) provides that \u201c[t]he right of an employee to seek redress by way of grievance for any dispute relating to his or her terms or conditions of employment is in lieu of any right of action that the employee may have in relation to any act or omission giving rise to the dispute\u201d. The full text of the statutory provisions at issue in this case is attached as an appendix to these reasons.\nII. The Associate Judge\u2019s Decision [10] An Associate Judge of the Federal Court granted the RCMP\u2019s motion, striking Ms. Davis\u2019 statement of claim without leave to amend. The Associate Judge found that subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA was clear, and that it expressly stated that (save for limited exceptions that were not applicable in this case) an employee\u2019s right to grieve any matter relating to the terms and conditions of their employment was in lieu of any right of action that the employee may otherwise have had.\n[11] Citing the Court of Appeal of Ontario\u2019s decision in Bron v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 ONCA 71, the Associate Judge held that the explicit privative clause created by subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA deprives courts of their residual discretion to entertain disputes over the terms and conditions of the employment of employees governed by the Act.\n[12] The Associate Judge further found that Ms. Davis\u2019 workplace concerns could have been the subject of a grievance, and that she had in fact used the grievance process but was dissatisfied with the result. Finally, the Associate Judge found that there was no \u201clegislative gap\u201d in the FPSLRA, nor was there any merit to Ms. Davis\u2019 allegation that there had been a \u201clegislative error\u201d in the enactment of subsection 236(1) of the Act.\nIII. The Federal Court Judge\u2019s Decision [13] Ms. Davis appealed the Associate Judge\u2019s decision to a judge of the Federal Court, alleging numerous errors on the part of the Associate Judge. These included her allegedly failing to consider the impact of Ms. Davis\u2019 disability, and failing to provide Ms. Davis with access to appropriate accommodation measures in the hearing process.\n[14] Ms. Davis also alleged that the Associate Judge failed to assist her with information and advice (including advice as to the points that ought to be included in her statement of claim), which Ms. Davis submitted the Associate Judge was obliged to do, given that Ms. Davis was a self\u2011represented litigant. The Associate Judge had also distracted Ms. Davis by making interventions, and had ignored Ms. Davis\u2019 argument regarding \u201cpoor advice\u201d.\n[15] In addition, Ms. Davis asserted that the Associate Judge refused to allow her to challenge the legislation, failed to analyze Ms. Davis\u2019 arguments, and failed to consider whether the grievance process could provide Ms. Davis with adequate redress. Finally, Ms. Davis submitted that the Associate Judge neglected to address her argument of bad faith and failed to provide adequate reasons for the decision.\n[16] In a decision reported as 2023 FC 280, the Federal Court judge found that Ms. Davis had not demonstrated any error on the part of the Associate Judge that would warrant the Court\u2019s intervention. After carefully considering each of Ms. Davis\u2019 arguments, the Federal Court judge was satisfied that the Associate Judge had not made any palpable and overriding errors in accommodating Ms. Davis\u2019 disabilities or her status as a self-represented litigant.\n[17] The Federal Court judge further found that the Associate Judge had not erred in rejecting Ms. Davis\u2019 argument as to the alleged \u201clegislative error\u201d in the FPSLRA or her claim that there was a gap in the legislative scheme. The Associate Judge had correctly concluded that the Federal Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain Ms. Davis\u2019 claim, as subsection 236(1) operated to bar claims such as hers, and she had not established that her claim came within any of the possible exceptions to the bar.\nIV. The Issues [18] Ms. Davis has raised numerous arguments as to the errors that she says were committed by the Associate Judge and by the Federal Court judge. While I have carefully considered all of Ms. Davis\u2019 arguments, it is only necessary to address some of them.\n[19] These arguments may be grouped under the following headings:\nWhat is the appropriate standard of review?\nDid the Associate Judge or the Federal Court judge fail to accommodate Ms. Davis\u2019 disability, and did they fail to have due regard to the fact that she is a self-represented litigant?\nWas there a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Associate Judge as a result of her past employment with the Department of Justice?\nDid the Associate Judge and the Federal Court judge err in law in finding that Ms. Davis\u2019 claim was barred by operation of subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA?\nV. The Standard of Review [20] The standard of review applicable to an appeal such as this is that established by the Supreme Court of Canada in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33. That is, where a Federal Court judge upholds a discretionary decision of an Associate Judge, this Court must examine the decision of the Associate Judge to determine whether the Federal Court erred in law or made a palpable and overriding error in refusing to intervene: Calliou v. Canada, 2019 FCA 23 at para. 9; Sikes v. Encana Corp., 2017 FCA 37 at para. 12, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 37509 (2 November 2017).\nVI. The Alleged Failure of the Federal Court to Accommodate Ms. Davis\u2019 Disabilities and her Status as a Self-Represented Litigant [21] Ms. Davis states that she is cognitively impaired as a result of a brain injury she suffered in infancy, and that she also suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. According to Ms. Davis, these conditions negatively affect her ability to represent herself in legal proceedings.\n[22] Indeed, a primary focus of Ms. Davis\u2019 submissions on this appeal was on the challenges and barriers faced by self-represented litigants who suffer from disabilities (particularly those who are cognitively impaired) in accessing the justice system. Noting that many people with disabilities live at, or below, the poverty line, Ms. Davis observed that most of these individuals will be unable to afford legal representation, and will be left trying to navigate the justice system on their own.\n[23] Ms. Davis also made submissions with respect to what she says were the shortcomings in the treatment that she received from the Federal Court, and its failure to accommodate her disabilities.\n[24] On the advice of the Federal Court Registry, Ms. Davis wrote to the Associate Judge a couple of weeks prior to the hearing of the motion to strike. She stated in her letter that she had a disability that occasionally impeded her \u201cability to articulate specific verbal and written words\u201d, explaining that what she sees on paper \u201cmay be significantly different\u201d from what others see. Ms. Davis went on to state that names were especially difficult for her to pronounce, and that the best that she could do when confronted with a name would be to spell the name for the Court.\n[25] Ms. Davis also advised the Associate Judge that it would sometimes take her a few extra moments to find the word she wanted, or she might say the wrong word and need to correct it. Ms. Davis\u2019 letter concluded by asking the Associate Judge to advise \u201chow you would like these issues to be dealt with during the hearing\u201d. Attached to Ms. Davis\u2019 letter was a note from her doctor that addressed Ms. Davis\u2019 need for certain accommodative measures in the workplace.\n[26] The Associate Judge responded by granting Ms. Davis leave \u201cto be accompanied [at the hearing] by a representative who may assist her as necessary\u201d. When Ms. Davis advised the Associate Judge shortly before the date set for the hearing that she had tested positive for COVID-19 and could not get certain documents sworn as a result, the Associate Judge allowed unsworn documents to be filed. The RCMP\u2019s motion to strike was then heard on the date originally set for the hearing, in accordance with Ms. Davis\u2019 wishes.\n[27] In considering the appeal from the Associate Judge\u2019s decision, the Federal Court judge watched the video of the motion hearing. The judge noted that Ms. Davis had not availed herself of the opportunity to bring a representative with her to assist her at the hearing, but that she had nevertheless been able to fully articulate her arguments. The Federal Court judge described the representations made to the Associate Judge by Ms. Davis as being \u201ccoherent, responsive [and] articulate\u201d, stating that Ms. Davis had \u201cadvocated her position admirably for a self-represented individual\u201d.\n[28] Ms. Davis gave no indication to the Associate Judge that she was experiencing any difficulties in presenting her case, save on one occasion where she indicated that she had been \u201cthrown off\u201d by a question from the Associate Judge. In response, the Associate Judge offered Ms. Davis a break to allow her to re-group, asking Ms. Davis how long she needed to collect her thoughts. Ms. Davis indicated that a 10-minute break would be sufficient, and the Associate Judge granted Ms. Davis\u2019 request.\n[29] Ms. Davis asserted before the Federal Court judge and before this Court that the Associate Judge had erred by offering her a break, rather than adjourning the hearing to another day in order to permit her to adequately prepare her submissions. Ms. Davis says that the Associate Judge ought to have offered an adjournment without Ms. Davis having to ask for it.\n[30] The Federal Court judge did not err in rejecting this argument.\n[31] There is no doubt that the history of disabled persons in Canada is largely one of exclusion and marginalization. Amongst other disadvantages they face, individuals with disabilities have been \u201csubjected to invidious stereotyping\u201d, and they have often been denied the equal concern, respect and consideration that the law requires: Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624, [1997] S.C.J. No. 86 at para. 56.\n[32] There is also no doubt that courts are required to accommodate the needs of self\u2011represented litigants with disabilities: see the discussion of this issue in Haynes v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 158 at paras. 18-32, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 41047 (6 June 2024).\n[33] The search for accommodation is, however, a two-way street. It is the responsibility of the disabled individual to bring the facts relating to the discrimination they are experiencing to the attention of the employer or service provider: Desormeaux v. City of Ottawa, 2005 FCA 311 at para. 19, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 31230 (23 March 2006). There is also an obligation on individuals seeking accommodation to assist in securing the appropriate accommodative measures: Haynes, above at para. 30, citing Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970, [1992] S.C.J. No. 75 at para. 43.\n[34] In this case, the Associate Judge had no way of knowing, or even surmising, that Ms. Davis needed an adjournment of the hearing. When Ms. Davis stated that she had been \u201cthrown off\u201d by the Associate Judge\u2019s questions, the Associate Judge quite reasonably responded by giving her the 10-minute break that Ms. Davis stated would be sufficient to allow her to re\u2011group. There was nothing unreasonable, unfair or discriminatory in the Associate Judge giving Ms. Davis precisely the accommodation that she sought.\n[35] Ms. Davis did not ask the Associate Judge to hold her questions until Ms. Davis had concluded her submissions in order to avoid a disruption to her thought processes. She did ask the Federal Court judge to do so, and the Federal Court judge honoured that request. Ms. Davis\u2019 similar request to this Court was honoured by the panel.\n[36] Judges are not clairvoyant, and they cannot be expected to know how a particular individual\u2019s disability may manifest itself in the course of a hearing. To require judges to speculate about a litigant\u2019s disability and the specific measures that the individual may require to accommodate that disability would invite reliance on stereotypes and potentially invidious assumptions as to the abilities of the individual\u2014precisely the things that human rights legislation is designed to avoid: Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, s. 2.\n[37] Ms. Davis states that she made numerous attempts to obtain legal advice, but that she was unable to do so. As a result, she says that the Associate Judge should have provided her with advice, including advice as to what information should be included in her statement of claim, and how she could go about challenging the provisions of the FPSLRA.\n[38] In support of this contention, Ms. Davis relies on the Canadian Judicial Council\u2019s Statement of Principles on Self-represented Litigants and Accused Persons, (September 2006) online (pdf): <https: \/\/www.cjc-ccm.gc.ca\/cmslib\/general\/news_pub_other_PrinciplesStateme nt_2006_en.pdf > [archived version: http: \/\/www.scc-csc.ca\/cso-dce\/2017SCC-CSC23_1_eng.pdf]. As Ms. Davis noted, the Supreme Court of Canada endorsed these principles in Pintea v. Johns, 2017 SCC 23 at para. 4.\n[39] While the Statement of Principles undoubtedly provides useful guidance for participants in the justice system as to the appropriate treatment of self-represented litigants, there are clear limits to a judge\u2019s duty to assist such individuals. In particular, the document recognizes that, in engaging in steps to protect the rights and interests of self-represented persons, judges cannot act in a manner that would compromise their neutrality and impartiality: Girao v. Cunningham, 2020 ONCA 260 at para. 151.\n[40] Indeed, the Court of Appeal for Ontario relied on the Statement of Principles at paragraph 51 of Thatcher-Craig v. Clearview (Township), 2023 ONCA 96, to draw a distinction between procedural and legal advice. The Court observed that while it is within a judge\u2019s discretion to control the court process and to grant latitude to a self-represented litigant on procedural issues, that discretion does not extend to rectifying substantive legal deficiencies.\n[41] The Statement of Principles also notes that there is a distinction between providing legal information (such as the information that we provided to Ms. Davis at the outset of her hearing in this Court as to the process that would be followed and as to the appropriate content of reply submissions), and providing legal advice.\n[42] As noted at page 11 of the Statement of Principles, legal advice includes, \u201camong other things \u2026 advising someone on how to best pursue a case\u201d. The information that Ms. Davis faults the Associate Judge for failing to provide clearly amounts to legal advice, and it would have been inappropriate for the Associate Judge to have provided Ms. Davis with the information in issue.\n[43] Ms. Davis also asserts that the Associate Judge erred by failing to appoint a lawyer to represent her at the Court\u2019s expense, submitting that allowing her to bring a representative with her to the hearing was insufficient.\n[44] It is not clear from the record that Ms. Davis ever raised this issue before the Associate Judge. She did, however, raise it before the Federal Court judge and before this Court, submitting that a legal representative should have been appointed for her in accordance with Rule 115 of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106, as she is a \u201cperson under a legal disability\u201d.\n[45] Rule 115(1)(b) provides that \u201c[t]he Court may appoint one or more persons to represent ... a person under a legal disability against or by whom a proceeding is brought\u201d. Rule 121 further provides that \u201c[u]nless the Court in special circumstances orders otherwise, a party who is under a legal disability [\u2026] shall be represented by a solicitor\u201d.\n[46] It should first be noted that there is nothing in the Rules that would require the Court to pay for a lawyer appointed under these Rules. Moreover, and in any event, as the Federal Court judge correctly advised Ms. Davis, a \u201cperson under a legal disability\u201d within the meaning of the Rules is a person who lacks the legal capacity to represent themselves: Haynes, above at para. 48. Ms. Davis clearly does not come within this definition. While Ms. Davis (like most self-represented litigants) would no doubt have benefited from legal advice, she was nevertheless able to provide the Court with lengthy, detailed and carefully researched submissions.\n[47] Ms. Davis has identified the very real challenges that are faced by self-represented litigants generally, and the even greater challenges that are faced by self-represented litigants who live with disabilities, as they attempt to navigate the judicial process in an effort to seek justice. These challenges have long been recognized by participants in the justice system and have been the subject of much study and commentary: Statement of Principles, above; Action Committee on Access to Justice in Civil and Family Matters, Access to Civil & Family Justice: A Roadmap for Change (Ottawa: Action Committee on Access to Justice in Civil and Family Matters, 2013). Regrettably, however, many such litigants remain unable to obtain legal advice.\n[48] While I have considerable sympathy for the position in which Ms. Davis finds herself, she has failed to establish that either the Associate Judge or the Federal Court judge erred in law or made a palpable and overriding error in failing to accommodate her disabilities or provide her with legal advice or legal representation.\nVII. Was there a Reasonable Apprehension of Bias on the Part of the Associate Judge? [49] Ms. Davis also asserts that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Associate Judge as a result of her past employment with the Department of Justice, where the Associate Judge had the RCMP as one of her client departments.\n[50] Ms. Davis raised this concern in a letter that she sent to the Associate Judge a couple of months prior to the hearing of the RCMP\u2019s motion to strike Ms. Davis\u2019 statement of claim. The Associate Judge dealt with Ms. Davis\u2019 objection by way of an Order dated December 9, 2021, which found that there was no bias, whether actual or apprehended, on her part.\n[51] Ms. Davis did not appeal this Order at the time that it was rendered, stating that she had decided instead to \u201cgive the Associate Judge the benefit of the doubt\u201d, and to proceed with the hearing of the RCMP\u2019s motion to strike a couple of months later. It appears that Ms. Davis did not pursue the bias issue before the Federal Court judge, and she did not raise it in her Notice of Appeal to this Court. However, Ms. Davis attempted to resurrect her bias claim in her written and oral submissions in this Court, arguing that the Associate Judge should have recused herself from Ms. Davis\u2019 case, given her relatively recent professional relationship with the RCMP.\n[52] It appears that Ms. Davis made the strategic decision not to pursue the bias issue relating to the Associate Judge\u2019s prior employment within the time period for appealing the December 9, 2021 Order. As a result, that Order is now final. While it was entirely open to Ms. Davis to choose not to appeal the Associate Judge\u2019s decision, she must now live with the consequences.\n[53] I understand that as a self-represented litigant, Ms. Davis may not have appreciated the consequences of her failure to appeal the Associate Judge\u2019s ruling on the issue of bias in a timely manner. Unfortunately, however, the fact that she is self-represented and is unfamiliar with the Court process does not provide her with special dispensation from the application of the law and the Federal Courts Rules: Nowoselsky v. Canada (Treasury Board), 2004 FCA 418 at para. 8; MacDonald v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FC 2 at para. 30.\n[54] Ms. Davis now adds to her allegations of bias, asserting in this Court that the Associate Judge acted \u201cwith a closed or an unconscious bias\u201d in finding that subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA explicitly ousts the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, without considering all of the relevant factors. I will deal with the ouster issue later in these reasons. Suffice it to say at this juncture that the Associate Judge did in fact consider the relevant factors in striking Ms. Davis\u2019 statement of claim.\n[55] The fact that the Associate Judge ruled in favour of the RCMP on the motion to strike is, moreover, insufficient to create a reasonable apprehension of bias in the mind of a reasonable, fully informed person, having thought the matter through: Collins v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 5 at para. 19; Committee for Justice and Liberty et al. v. National Energy Board et al., [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369, [1976] S.C.J. No.118 at 394.\nVIII. Did the Associate Judge Err in Striking Ms. Davis\u2019 Statement of Claim? [56] The next question for determination is whether the Associate Judge erred in striking Ms. Davis\u2019 statement of claim.\n[57] The RCMP\u2019s motion to strike was brought under Rules 221(a) and (f) of the Federal Courts Rules, alleging that the Federal Court lacked the jurisdiction to entertain Ms. Davis\u2019 action by virtue of subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA.\n[58] The case law tells us that a statement of claim should not be struck unless it is plain and obvious that the action cannot succeed, assuming the facts pleaded in the statement of claim to be true: Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959, [1990] S.C.J. No. 93 at 980; Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd. v. Microsoft Corporation, 2013 SCC 57 at para. 63. In other words, the claim must have no reasonable prospect of success: R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42 at para. 21.\n[59] The threshold that a plaintiff must meet to establish that a claim discloses a reasonable cause of action is a low one: Brake v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 274 at para. 70. A claim must, moreover, be read generously, in a manner that accommodates any inadequacies in the allegations that are merely the result of deficiencies in the drafting of the document: see Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441, [1985] S.C.J. No. 22 at 451.\n[60] Judges should refrain from delving into the merits of a plaintiff\u2019s argument on a motion to strike, but should, rather, consider whether the plaintiff should be precluded from advancing the argument at all: Salna v. Voltage Pictures, LLC, 2021 FCA 176 at para. 77. Recognizing that the law is not static, judges must also err on the side of permitting novel, but arguable claims to proceed to trial: R. v. Imperial Tobacco, above at paras. 19-25; Mohr v. National Hockey League, 2022 FCA 145 at para. 48, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 40426 (20 April 2023).\n[61] That said, it must also be recognized that there is a cost to access to justice in allowing cases that have no substance to proceed. The diversion of scarce judicial resources to such cases diverts time away from potentially meritorious cases that require attention: Mohr, above at para. 50; Coote v. Lawyers\u2019 Professional Indemnity Company, 2013 FCA 143 at para. 13.\n[62] Ms. Davis submits that in striking her statement of claim, the Associate Judge erred in law by failing to treat her claims as true. In particular, Ms. Davis says that it was sufficient for her to allege that subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA did not apply to her as an unrepresented employee. The Associate Judge should also have assumed that her claims were true that the RCMP grievance process was a sham, as it was corrupt, ineffective and ridden with bias.\n[63] As noted earlier, the case law does indeed tell us that judges considering motions to strike must assume that the facts pleaded in the statement of claim are true. The difficulty with Ms. Davis\u2019 argument is that none of the allegations referred to in the previous paragraph appear anywhere in her statement of claim. They are, rather, claims that she has made in her written and oral submissions.\n[64] Ms. Davis also asserts that the Associate Judge and the Federal Court judge erred in law in failing to give adequate consideration to her contention that as an unrepresented employee, she was not bound by the grievance procedures outlined in the FPSLRA.\n[65] This assertion is not borne out by a review of the Associate Judge\u2019s decision. Not only were Ms. Davis\u2019 arguments summarized at paragraphs 15 to 17 of the Associate Judge\u2019s order, her arguments were then analyzed at paragraphs 18 to 21 of the order. The fact that Ms. Davis\u2019 arguments were rejected by the Associate Judge does not mean that they were not considered.\n[66] Ms. Davis has also failed to provide any support for her claim that, as an unrepresented employee, she was not bound by the grievance procedures outlined in the FPSLRA.\n[67] Part 1 of the FPSLRA deals with labour relations, and it only applies to employees who are subject to collective agreements. In contrast, Part 2 of the Act (which addresses the grievance process) applies to both unionized and non-represented employees. This is made clear by the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in subsection 206(1). This provides that for the purposes of Part 2 of the Act (with some exceptions that do not apply to Ms. Davis), the term \u201cemployee\u201d means \u201ca person employed in the public service\u201d.\n[68] Subsection 208(1)(b) of the Act permits these employees to present individual grievances if they feel aggrieved with respect to \u201cany occurrence or matter affecting his or her terms and conditions of employment\u201d. Ms. Davis cannot escape the operation of subsection 236 by asserting that her claim is not an ordinary workplace dispute. As the Court of Appeal of Ontario observed at paragraphs 14-15 of Bron, above, the right to grieve is \u201cvery broad\u201d, and \u201c[a]lmost all employment-related disputes can be grieved\u201d under the terms of the governing legislation.\n[69] Ms. Davis claims that the grievance process does not apply to non-unionized employees because it is not included in any directive, policy or employment contract. Whether or not that is the case, it is included in the FPSLRA, which is the law that governs the terms and conditions of employment of most federal public servants, including Ms. Davis.\n[70] The fact that the grievance process is indeed available to unrepresented employees such as Ms. Davis is borne out by the fact that her complaints about her supervisor and the Assistant Commissioner\u2019s decision were dealt with through the RCMP\u2019s grievance system. It was only after her grievance was dismissed at the third level that Ms. Davis turned to the Federal Court for relief.\n[71] The Associate Judge also did not err in law in rejecting Ms. Davis\u2019 claim that the inclusion of the ouster provision in subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA was the result of a \u201clegislative error\u201d. Not only has she failed to point to any facts to support this assertion, it also runs counter to the principle of statutory interpretation that Parliament does not speak in vain: Ebadi v. Canada, 2024 FCA 39 at para. 35; R. v. D.A.I., 2012 SCC 5 at para. 31; Attorney General of Quebec v. Carri\u00e8res Ste-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Lt\u00e9e, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 831, [1985] S.C.J. No. 37 at 838.\n[72] Ms. Davis has also not identified any \u201clegislative gap\u201d in the FPSLRA that would somehow exempt her from the application of subsection 236(1). Indeed, in Bron, the Court of Appeal of Ontario specifically held that there is no \u201clegislative gap\u201d in the legislation, and that subsection 236(1) \u201cspeaks directly to workplace complaints that are grievable under the legislation\u201d. In such cases, the grievance procedure operates \u201cin lieu of any right of action\u201d, even when there is no access to third-party adjudication: both quotes from Bron above at para. 32.\n[73] According to Ms. Davis, the Associate Judge also erred in law in putting the onus on her to demonstrate that her statement of claim should not be struck, rather than requiring the RCMP, as the moving party, to demonstrate that her claim had no possibility of success.\n[74] It is true that the initial onus is on the party seeking to establish that a pleading fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action: Brink v. Canada, 2024 FCA 43 at para. 44; La Rose v. Canada, 2023 FCA 241 at para. 19. The RCMP met its onus in this case by invoking subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA, which bars actions such as that commenced by Ms. Davis. The onus then shifted to Ms. Davis to demonstrate that her claim came within an exception to the general rule: Lebrasseur v. Canada, 2007 FCA 330 at para. 19. This she failed to do.\n[75] As noted at the outset of these reasons, subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA states that \u201c[t]he right of an employee to seek redress by way of grievance for any dispute relating to his or her terms or conditions of employment is in lieu of any right of action that the employee may have in relation to any act or omission giving rise to the dispute\u201d [my emphasis]. Conflicts related to \u201cterms or conditions of employment\u201d have been found \u201cto encompass allegations of defamation, discrimination, harassment, malice and bad faith, Charter breaches, and intentional torts, including intentional infliction of mental suffering\u201d: Ebadi, above at para. 29.\n[76] Ms. Davis relies on this Court\u2019s decision in Canada v. Greenwood, 2021 FCA 186, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 39885 (17 March 2022), as authority for the proposition that claims of systemic negligence are properly the subject of actions against the RCMP by its employees, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 236(1) of the Act. There are several difficulties with Ms. Davis\u2019 argument.\n[77] The first is that nowhere in her statement of claim does Ms. Davis plead negligence on the part of the RCMP, whether systemic or otherwise, as a cause of action.\n[78] More importantly, Ms. Davis\u2019 reliance on Greenwood is misplaced. Greenwood was an appeal from a certification order issued by the Federal Court in a class proceeding. The action related to the allegedly systemic bullying, intimidation and harassment of individuals who worked for the RCMP and\/or with the RCMP. The statement of claim further alleged that the RCMP was negligent in failing to provide the representative plaintiffs and other class members with a workplace that was free from bullying and harassment.\n[79] Greenwood does not, however, stand for the proposition that indeterminate public servants such as Ms. Davis can sue the RCMP, as long as they allege systemic negligence on the part of their employer. In fact, it suggests that precisely the opposite is the case.\n[80] Indeed, this Court specifically addressed the situation of indeterminate civilian employees of the RCMP, noting at paragraph 39 of Greenwood that \u201cpublic service employees who have the right to file grievances under section 208 of the FPSLRA are excluded from the class\u201d. This would include indeterminate public servants such as Ms. Davis.\n[81] In other words, people in Ms. Davis\u2019 position were specifically excluded from the class on whose behalf the proceeding in Greenwood was brought.\n[82] The other cases relied on by Ms. Davis also do not assist her.\n[83] There was no suggestion by the respondent in Davidson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 ONSC 8008, Merlo v. Canada, 2017 FC 533 or Tiller v. Canada, 2019 FC 895, that the bar in subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA applied to the plaintiffs in these cases: Adelberg FCA, above at para. 47.\n[84] Moreover, while civilian employees of the RCMP were originally part of the class on whose behalf the proceeding was brought in Davidson, it appears that the plaintiff in that case intended to amend the class definition in her statement of claim to remove public service employees from the class, presumably because of the jurisdictional difficulties that would result from their inclusion: Adelberg FCA, above at para. 9.\n[85] Most recently, in Adelberg FCA, above, this Court found that the Federal Court had erred in striking claims made by members of the RCMP who sought to challenge various COVID-19-related policies issued by Treasury Board. This Court found that it was not plain and obvious that members of the RCMP possessed grievance rights that would preclude them from bringing an action such as the one in issue in that case: at para. 45.\n[86] This Court did not, however, interfere with the Federal Court\u2019s finding that the claims of plaintiffs who were subject to subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA should be struck: Adelberg v. Canada, 2023 FC 252 at para. 8; Adelberg FCA, above at para. 59.\n[87] As noted earlier, Ms. Davis also contends that the RCMP grievance process was inadequate, flawed, biased, corrupt and misleading, and that this brings her claim under one of the exceptions to the bar created by subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA.\n[88] This Court has recently addressed the common law exceptions to the bar created by subsection 236(1) in Ebadi, above at para. 47. There, this Court noted that courts retain a residual discretion to allow an action to proceed, notwithstanding the legislative bar contained in subsection 236(1) of the Act. However, this is so only where the internal grievance mechanism is incapable of providing effective redress: see also Greenwood, above at para. 130; Bron, above at paras. 27-30.\n[89] This Court further noted in Ebadi that in Canada v. Robichaud and MacKinnon, 2013 NBCA 3, the New Brunswick Court of Appeal confined this discretion to situations where the grievance process is entirely \u201ccorrupt\u201d: Ebadi, above at para. 47; Robichaud, above at para. 10.\n[90] However, as was the case in the Lebrasseur decision cited earlier, the record in this appeal contains no evidence that would demonstrate that the RCMP\u2019s internal grievance mechanism was incapable of providing effective redress. It was incumbent on Ms. Davis to have provided evidence about the efficacy of the grievance process if she wished the Court to exercise its discretion to hear her claim. In the absence of any such evidence, it was open to the Federal Court to have struck her statement of claim, without leave to amend: Adelberg FCA, above at para. 59.\n[91] The lack of third-party adjudication also does not, in and of itself, allow a court to exercise its residual discretion to hear a claim: Ebadi, above at para. 26. This is because subsection 236(2) states that the exclusivity of the grievance process identified in subsection 236(1) operates whether or not the employee actually presents a grievance, and whether or not the grievance could be referred to adjudication. The result of the language used in these two provisions is that courts no longer have any residual discretion to entertain claims that are otherwise grievable under the FPSLRA on the basis of an employee\u2019s inability to access third\u2011party adjudication: Bron, above at para. 29.\n[92] The Federal Court judge thus did not err in law or make a palpable and overriding error in refusing to intervene in the Associate Judge\u2019s decision. In particular, the Federal Court judge did not err in failing to find that the RCMP grievance process is corrupt, or in failing to find that exceptional circumstances exist that would allow Ms. Davis\u2019 civil claim to proceed in the Federal Court.\n[93] Ms. Davis also argues that judicial review is not a reasonable alternative to a right of action as damages are not recoverable through the judicial review process. According to Ms. Davis, this warrants a favourable exercise of discretion allowing her action to proceed to trial. I note, however, that a similar argument was rejected by this Court in Ebadi, above at paras. 56\u201160.\n[94] It is true that damages are not available as a remedy in judicial review applications: Garshowitz v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FCA 251 at para. 10; Maximova v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FCA 230 at para. 14. Damages are, however, available through the grievance process: Wojdan v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FC 1341 at para. 27, aff\u2019d 2022 FCA 120.\n[95] As a result, it would be open to the Federal Court to find that an administrative decision-maker, such as a grievance officer, erred in failing to compensate a grievor for his or her losses. The Federal Court would then be able to refer the matter back for redetermination on that basis.\n[96] Finally, Ms. Davis argued that the Associate Judge made a palpable and overriding error in denying her leave to amend her statement of claim to address any errors that she may have made in drafting the document as a result of her lack of legal training.\n[97] For a claim to be struck without leave to amend, the defect in the statement of claim must be one that is not curable by amendment: Simon v. Canada, 2011 FCA 6 at para. 8; Hunt v. Carey, above at paras. 23-24, 28.\n[98] As the Federal Court judge observed in this case, when considering whether a statement of claim should be struck, the motions judge \u201cmust look beyond the words used, the facts alleged, and the remedy sought\u201d: at para. 92. The judge must ensure that the proceedings are \u201cnot a disguised attempt to reach before the Federal Court a result otherwise unreachable in that Court\u201d: citing Canada v. Roitman, 2006 FCA 266 at para. 16.\n[99] Ms. Davis seeks to question the authority and validity of subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA, asserting that it is invalid as such a privative clause \u201cis a labour law tool and the unrepresented employee is under the employment law\u201d. As noted earlier, she also seeks to argue that \u201ccollective agreement clauses (including the grievance process) [do not] apply to the unrepresented employee if they are not contained in any directive, policy or the employment contract\u201d. For the reasons given, I have concluded that neither argument has any merit. Consequently, I am not persuaded that the Associate Judge erred in law or committed a palpable or overriding error by denying Ms. Davis leave to amend her statement of claim.\nIX. Conclusion [100] Although only some employer-employee relationships in the federal public service are governed by collective agreements, all are governed by the applicable federal legislation. As the Supreme Court held in Vaughan v. Canada, 2005 SCC 11, where Parliament has created a statutory scheme for dealing with labour disputes (as it has done with the enactment of the FPSLRA), \u201ccourts should not jeopardize the comprehensive dispute resolution process contained in the legislation by permitting routine access to the courts\u201d. Rather, \u201cthe general rule of deference in matters arising out of labour relations should prevail\u201d: both quotes from Vaughan, above at para. 39.\n[101] Subsection 236(1) states clearly and unequivocally that the right granted to public service employees under Part 2 of the FPSLRA to grieve any dispute related to the terms and conditions of their employment is \u201cin lieu of any right of action\u201d that the employee may have in respect of the same matter: Bron, above at para. 29. Ms. Davis\u2019 claims unquestionably relate to the terms and conditions of her employment.\n[102] If Ms. Davis was dissatisfied with the third level grievance decision, her avenue of recourse was to the Federal Court through the judicial review process. It would have been open to the Federal Court to consider Ms. Davis\u2019 arguments in that context, including her arguments as to the inadequacy of the RCMP\u2019s investigation into her allegations, the procedural unfairness of the grievance process and the bias and corruption that she says is inherent in the process.\n[103] However, allowing Ms. Davis\u2019 civil action to proceed would undermine Parliament\u2019s intent in enacting subsection 236(1) of the Act, and would amount to \u201can impermissible incursion into the statutory scheme\u201d: Greenwood, above at para. 130.\n[104] Having carefully examined the decision of the Associate Judge, I am satisfied that the Federal Court judge did not err in law or make a palpable and overriding error in refusing to intervene. For these reasons, I would dismiss Ms. Davis\u2019 appeal. The RCMP did not seek its costs and I would not award any.\n\u201cAnne L. Mactavish\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nK. A.

COB TFI TRANSPORT 22LP (Operating as Looming Express)\nRespondents\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nWALKER J.A.\n[1] The appellant in the first appeal (Court file A-146-23), Mr. Fick, appeals a judgment of the Federal Court (Fick v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), 2023 FC 718) dismissing his application for judicial review of a January 2022 decision of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal). In the second appeal (Court file A-163-23), the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) appeals the same Federal Court judgment, focussing its appeal on the Tribunal\u2019s assessment and conclusions regarding the application to Mr. Fick\u2019s case of section 25 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the Act). These appeals were consolidated by Order of this Court dated July 10, 2023, with the appeal in Court File A-163-23 being designated as the lead appeal.\n[2] In its decision, the Tribunal dismissed Mr. Fick\u2019s 2016 complaint to the Commission in which Mr. Fick alleged that the respondent, 6589856 Canada Inc. (Loomis), discriminated against him on the basis of age and, primarily, disability contrary to section 7 of the Act when it terminated their working relationship in 2016. The Tribunal concluded (1) that age and disability were not factors in Loomis\u2019 termination of Mr. Fick\u2019s transportation services, and (2) that Mr. Fick\u2019s relationship with Loomis did not fall within the definition of \u201cemployment\u201d in section 25 of the Act.\n[3] The Federal Court in turn concluded that the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the two central issues before it was justified and intelligible and that the Tribunal\u2019s decision was reasonable.\n[4] In an appeal to this Court of a Federal Court decision on judicial review, we are required to determine whether the Federal Court: (i) selected the appropriate standard of review; and (ii) if so, correctly applied that standard: Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36 at paras. 45-47. In this second regard, we step into the shoes of the Federal Court and consider the administrative decision at issue, here the Tribunal decision.\n[5] I have very carefully considered the decisions of the Tribunal and of the Federal Court, the record and the parties\u2019 written and oral arguments in arriving at the following conclusions. On behalf of the Court, I recognize that for Mr. Fick and his spouse, Ms. Kruger, this has been an immensely difficult process during a period of prolonged personal upheaval.\n[6] First, I find that the Federal Court correctly identified reasonableness as the standard to be applied to its review of the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\n[7] Second, the Tribunal correctly set out the three-part test Mr. Fick was required to meet to establish his allegation of discrimination: Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 360 at para. 33. Applying the test, the Tribunal determined that Mr. Fick suffered from a disability due to a serious heart attack in January 2016 and that he endured an adverse impact due to the termination of his work with Loomis. However, the Tribunal found that there was insufficient evidence that Mr. Fick\u2019s heart attack and resulting disability were factors in Loomis\u2019 termination decision. In other words, Mr. Fick had not established a prima facie case of discrimination.\n[8] I find no reviewable error in the Tribunal\u2019s review of the evidence or in its conclusion that it could not draw from the evidence the suggestion or \u201cscent\u201d of discrimination. I agree with the Federal Court that the Tribunal methodically assessed the evidence before it and that its findings were clear, justified and, ultimately, reasonable.\n[9] This finding is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. Our jurisdiction, and that of the Tribunal and Federal Court, extends only to Mr. Fick\u2019s complaint to the Commission and his allegation of discrimination as a factor in the termination decision. It does not extend to the question of whether Loomis\u2019 business practices or termination decision was made in accordance with relevant employment and labour (union) laws. The January 19, 2018 decision of the adjudicator appointed under the Canada Labour Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2 (the Code) determining that she did not have authority to decide Mr. Fick\u2019s unjust dismissal claim made under the Code is not before the Court. The adjudicator\u2019s decision was previously found reasonable by this Court (6586856 Canada Inc. (Loomis Express) v. Fick, 2021 FCA 2) on appeal from a decision of the Federal Court (Fick v. 6586856 Canada Inc., 2019 FC 759).\n[10] In the absence of a finding of discrimination, the complaint and this appeal must fail.\n[11] The parties nevertheless focussed their arguments on the findings of the Tribunal regarding the definition of \u201cemployment\u201d in section 25 of the Act and its application to Mr. Fick\u2019s relationship with Loomis. Briefly, I do not agree that the Tribunal failed to take a broad and purposive approach to its interpretation of section 25 or that the Tribunal restricted the protections afforded by the Act to skilled workers.\n[12] The Tribunal highlighted the necessity of a broad interpretation of the meaning of employment in human rights legislation and the fact that the interpretation differed from that developed under other legal frameworks. The Tribunal was alive to the fact that a contract for services may fall within the definition of employment for purposes of the Act. It found that Mr. Fick\u2019s arrangement with Loomis did not require that he personally provide the contracted services, as referenced in section 25 of the Act, and turned to the common law and the question of control by the employer: McCormick v. Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP, 2014 SCC 39, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 108 at para. 23. In this latter regard, the Tribunal reviewed the evidence at length and set out its conclusions intelligibly and logically.\n[13] The Commission centres its arguments in part on the Tribunal\u2019s language distinguishing the facts of a particular case, Canada (Attorney General) v. Lapierre, 2004 FC 612, from the facts in this case (Tribunal decision at para. 108). In contrasting the requirement for the scientist in that case to perform the contracted services personally, the Tribunal referred to the fact that Mr. Fick was permitted to hire other drivers. Although I do not agree with its simplistic and harsh description of Mr. Fick\u2019s role, the Tribunal\u2019s language does not limit the application of section 25 of the Act to skilled workers. Rather, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is based squarely on the facts of Mr. Fick\u2019s case.\n[14] I find no reviewable error in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the evidence and section 25 of the Act that warrants this Court\u2019s intervention. Mr. Fick views the evidence very differently and asks this Court to come to a different conclusion from that of the Tribunal and the Federal Court. However, our role is not to re-weigh the evidence but to assess whether the Tribunal\u2019s analysis and conclusions regarding the evidence were reasonably open to it.\n[15] I note Mr. Fick\u2019s allegations of a lack of judicial impartiality, and of fraud and criminal activity on the part of many of those involved in this and the arbitration litigation, including the Tribunal, the Federal Court, the arbitrator in 2018 and the respondent Loomis\u2019 original counsel. Certain of the allegations and statements made in this regard are not relevant to these proceedings as the current appeals address only Mr. Fick\u2019s discrimination complaint under the Act. The remaining allegations are not supported by the evidence.\n[16] Accordingly, I would dismiss both appeals without costs.

MONAGHAN J.A.\nDate: 20240628\nDocket: A-149-22\nCitation: 2024 FCA 117\nCORAM:\nMACTAVISH J.A.\nMONAGHAN J.A.\nHECKMAN J.A.\nBETWEEN:\nDALE KOHLENBERG\nAppellant\nand\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nHECKMAN J.A.\n[1] The appellant, Dale Kohlenberg, a lawyer with the Department of Justice (DOJ), appeals the decision of the Federal Court in Kohlenberg v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FC 906, [2022] F.C.J. No. 912 (QL) (per Fothergill J.). The Court dismissed the appellant\u2019s application for judicial review of a decision by Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM) Elisabeth Eid to dismiss his grievance seeking damages for defamation by a senior labour relations advisor (LRA).\nI. Background [2] On July 9, 2012, the appellant grieved a work description provided by management on the grounds that it did not accurately reflect the work that he did or was expected to do. The grievance was dismissed at the third level by ADM Marie-Jos\u00e9e Thivierge.\n[3] The appellant sought judicial review of the decision dismissing his grievance. The Federal Court allowed the application: Kohlenberg v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FC 414, [2017] F.C.J. No. 485 (QL) (per Brown J.) [Kohlenberg 1]. It decided that ADM Thivierge\u2019s decision was procedurally flawed because she had failed to disclose to the appellant two staff memoranda that contained relevant and material information on the matter she was to decide. Had it not quashed the decision for procedural unfairness, the Federal Court would have upheld the decision on its merits as reasonable.\n[4] One of the two staff memoranda was a confidential memorandum (the \u201cmemo\u201d) written by a senior LRA and addressed to ADM Thivierge. This memo contained two statements (the \u201cstatements\u201d) that the appellant argues were defamatory:\nYou will note that the grievor did not meet expectations for 2013-2014. As an aside, [he] was disciplined for the behaviours described in his 2013-2014 PREA [Performance Review and Employee Appraisal].\n[5] The appellant maintains, and the respondent admits, that the first statement (the \u201cdid not meet\u201d statement) was false because he had successfully grieved this assessment of his performance in his 2013-2014 PREA shortly before the memo was written. With regard to the second statement (the \u201cdisciplined for behaviours\u201d statement), the appellant argues that while he was disciplined for a single instance of improper behaviour, the use of the plural \u201cbehaviours\u201d was defamatory.\n[6] Shortly after becoming aware of the memo, the appellant threatened to bring a civil action in defamation against its author. Following an exchange of correspondence with counsel for the Attorney General about the availability of a civil action, he eventually submitted a grievance alleging defamation.\n[7] ADM Johanne Bernard dismissed the grievance on the grounds that it was untimely and that the allegation of defamation was not substantiated. The Federal Court quashed this decision because it was arrived at in a procedurally unfair manner since the appellant was not informed that the timeliness of his grievance was an issue. It also found the decision unreasonable because ADM Bernard had not applied the correct legal test for defamation. The Federal Court remitted the matter to a different decision maker: Kohlenberg v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FC 1066, [2020] F.C.J. No. 1116 (QL) (per Mosley J.) [Kohlenberg 2].\n[8] ADM Eid dismissed the grievance, though she provided the appellant with a letter of apology and confirmation that the memo had been retracted and replaced with a version correcting his 2013-2014 PREA rating.\n[9] ADM Eid held that the grievance was untimely because the appellant had failed to file it within the applicable time limits. In her view, the correspondence from counsel for the Attorney General had neither served to extend these time limits nor otherwise led the appellant to believe they had been waived.\n[10] ADM Eid also decided that, even if the appellant had proven that the statements were defamatory in the sense of tending to lower his reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, that they referred to him and that they were communicated to another person (citing Grant v. Torstar Corp., 2009 SCC 61, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 640 at para. 28), the respondent had established defences to escape liability.\n[11] She found that the main thrust of the \u201cdisciplined for behaviours\u201d statement\u2014that the appellant had been disciplined for inappropriate behaviour\u2014was substantially true. Moreover, she held that both the \u201cdisciplined for behaviours\u201d and the \u201cdid not meet\u201d statements were covered by the defence of qualified privilege. Relying on Bent v. Platnick, 2020 SCC 23, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 645 at paragraph 121, she concluded that an occasion of qualified privilege existed because the senior LRA was duty-bound to provide the third level decision maker, ADM Thivierge, with information, analysis and recommendations to assist her in deciding whether to allow or dismiss the grievance and because ADM Thivierge had a reciprocal duty to receive this candid and confidential advice.\n[12] In his application for judicial review, the appellant challenged ADM Eid\u2019s decision on procedural and substantive grounds. The Federal Court dismissed his application.\n[13] The Federal Court found that the appellant had been treated fairly, citing Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69, [2019] 1 F.C.R. 121 at paragraphs 34\u201356, and Siffort v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FC 351, [2020] F.C.J. No. 327 (QL) at paragraph 18. ADM Eid had informed the appellant of the case he had to meet in advance of the hearing, including that the timeliness of the grievance remained a live issue, and had given him opportunities to make his case, including by making further written submissions after the hearing. It also concluded ADM Eid was not required to give notice of her reliance on regulations, notice of the law being presumed.\n[14] The Federal Court reviewed the merits of the decision on the reasonableness standard. While it expressed doubt that ADM Eid had reasonably addressed the timeliness issue, it concluded that it was not necessary to decide the question, because it was of the view that her analysis and decision to dismiss the appellant\u2019s defamation claim were reasonable. In particular, the Federal Court concluded that ADM Eid had reasonably concluded that the defence of qualified privilege applied to the statements and that the defence of justification applied to the \u201cdisciplined for behaviours\u201d statement.\nII. The role of this Court on this appeal and the standards of review [15] On this appeal, this Court\u2019s role is to step into the shoes of the reviewing court and focus on the administrative decision. We are to ask whether the application judge chose the correct standard of review and applied it properly: Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559 at paras. 45\u201347; Northern Regional Health Authority v. Horrocks, 2021 SCC 42, 462 D.L.R. (4th) 585 at paras. 10\u201312.\n[16] I am satisfied that the Federal Court applied the correct standards of review to the question of whether the decision was procedurally fair and to the substance of ADM Eid\u2019s analysis and conclusions on the defamation questions, including whether the respondent had succeeded in establishing defences to the appellant\u2019s defamation claim.\n[17] With regard to the substance of ADM Eid\u2019s decision, reasonableness is the presumptive standard and there is no indication that Parliament intended another standard to apply: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653 at para. 17. The appellant observes that ADM Eid\u2019s decision has a potentially broad impact on the federal civil service grievance regime because it involves the application of the law of defamation within the federal civil service grievance process and the interpretation of section 63 of the Public Service Labour Relations Regulations, SOR\/2005-79 (now titled the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Regulations, SOR\/2005-79 [FPSLRR]). That provision addresses when untimely grievances may be rejected. As such, he argues, the decision involves general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole that must be reviewed on a correctness standard.\n[18] The category of general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole is narrow; it is not, as the Supreme Court explained, \u201ca broad catch-all category for correctness review\u201d: Vavilov at para. 61. The fact that a dispute is of wider public concern or involves a question that, when framed in a general or abstract sense, touches an important issue, is not sufficient for a question to fall within that category: Vavilov at para. 61. This Court has held that such questions:\n\u2026 must be \u201cgeneral questions of law\u201d of \u201cfundamental importance\u201d and \u201cbroad applicability\u201d with \u201csignificant legal consequences\u201d for \u201cthe legal system\u201d, \u201cthe justice system\u201d, \u201cthe administration of justice as a whole\u201d, or \u201cother institutions of government\u201d. They must be questions that require \u201cuniform\u201d, \u201cconsistent\u201d, \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cdeterminate\u201d answers, failing which the constitutional principle of the rule of law will suffer.\nPortnov v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 171, [2021] F.C.R. 501 at para. 12 [citations omitted].\n[19] The questions raised by ADM Eid\u2019s decision do not transcend the federal civil service grievance regime in which they arise, as the jurisprudence on this category of legal questions requires. Nor does the fact that the common law principles governing the law of defamation emanate from courts make their application in the federal public service grievance context a general question of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole: Nor-Man Regional Health Authority Inc. v. Manitoba Association of Health Care Professionals, 2011 SCC 59, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 616 at para. 44. The Federal Court appropriately reviewed the merits of ADM Eid\u2019s decision on the reasonableness standard.\n[20] The appellant conceded at the hearing that if this Court upholds as reasonable ADM Eid\u2019s decision that the respondent successfully established defences to his defamation claim and that these defences were not defeated by the appellant, that is sufficient to dispose of this appeal and we need not examine the reasonableness of ADM Eid\u2019s decision that the grievance was untimely.\n[21] Accordingly, I will focus my reasons on the reasonableness of ADM Eid\u2019s analysis and conclusions on the appellant\u2019s defamation claim and, in particular, on the respondent\u2019s defences to this claim.\n[22] Before turning to this issue, I find that the Federal Court correctly determined that ADM Eid\u2019s decision that the appellant\u2019s grievance was untimely was procedurally fair because she gave him an opportunity to address the issue in writing and at the hearing. I agree with the Federal Court that the duty of fairness did not require ADM Eid to provide the appellant notice that she would be relying on the FPSLRR.\nIII. ADM Eid\u2019s decision on the defamation claim was reasonable [23] A reasonable decision is one that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker: Vavilov at paras. 85, 90. The role of this Court is to examine ADM Eid\u2019s reasons with respectful attention to understand the reasoning process she followed to arrive at her decision: Vavilov at para. 84. We must read her reasons holistically and contextually in light of the record before her: Canada Post Corp. v. Canadian Union of Postal Workers, 2019 SCC 67, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 900 at para. 31; Vavilov at paras. 96\u201397.\n[24] In detailed reasons, ADM Eid set out the legal framework applicable to the appellant\u2019s defamation claim and applied it to the evidence in the record before her. The appellant conceded at the hearing that, for the most part, he took no issue with this legal framework but contested ADM Eid\u2019s application of the framework to the facts. However, in applying the reasonableness standard, this Court must refrain from reweighing and reassessing the evidence considered by ADM Eid; our intervention into ADM Eid\u2019s application of the framework to the facts will be justified only if the appellant establishes that she fundamentally misapprehended or failed to account for the evidence before her: Vavilov at paras. 125\u201326.\nA. The \u201cdisciplined for behaviours\u201d statement [25] Relying on Green v. Bush, 2017 MBQB 83, [2017] M.J. No. 135 (QL) at paragraph 38, and Jian v. Sing Tao Daily Ltd., 2014 ONSC 287, [2014] O.J. No. 3351 (QL) at paragraph 46, ADM Eid observed that establishing that a defamatory expression is substantially true is a defence to a defamation claim. As noted in Jian, it is not necessary to prove the truth of each word so long as the substance of the allegations is justified. In Bent v. Platnick at paragraph 107, the Supreme Court confirmed that to establish the defence of justification, a defendant must \u201cprove the substantial truth of the \u2018\u201csting\u201d, or main thrust, of the defamation\u2019\u201d [citations omitted].\n[26] ADM Eid observed that while the use of \u201cbehaviours\u201d in the plural form could imply that the appellant was disciplined for behaviours involving more than one incident, it could be reasonably interpreted as implying that he had been disciplined for several behaviours from one incident. Most significantly, she concluded that the main thrust of the statement\u2014that the appellant had been disciplined for the behaviours described in his 2013-2014 PREA\u2014was that he was disciplined for inappropriate behaviour. In her view, this remained true.\n[27] The appellant claimed that he was disciplined in December 2013 for one behaviour in a single incident: sending an email critical of management to a broad departmental distribution list. However, documents in the record before ADM Eid, including the discipline letter, indicated that the discipline was imposed in the context of an incident of misconduct preceded by similar wilful acts of inappropriate behaviour characterized as ongoing misconduct. In light of the evidence in the record before her, I find that it was open to ADM Eid to conclude that the main thrust of the \u201cdisciplined for behaviours\u201d statement was that the appellant was disciplined for inappropriate behaviour and that this statement was substantially true.\n[28] The appellant argued that his position is supported by a passage from the Federal Court\u2019s judgment in Kohlenberg 1 at paragraph 84, where Justice Brown observed that while \u201cthe plural use of the word \u2018behaviour\u2019 indicates that there was more than one incident \u2026 leading to the Applicant being disciplined,\u201d there was in fact \u201conly one behaviour for which he had [been] disciplined.\u201d In my view, the Federal Court quashed ADM Thivierge\u2019s decision because the memo containing relevant and material information was not disclosed to the appellant, contrary to the rules of procedural fairness. While these obiter comments support the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that the memo should have been disclosed, they were not made as part of an inquiry into whether the \u201cdisciplined for behaviours\u201d statement was substantially true.\n[29] Accordingly, ADM Eid\u2019s decision that the respondent had established the defence of justification in respect of the \u201cdisciplined for behaviours\u201d statement is reasonable. The appellant has not shown that, in coming to this conclusion, she fundamentally misapprehended or failed to account for the evidence before her.\nB. The \u201cdid not meet\u201d statement [30] ADM Eid held that the statements occurred on an occasion of qualified privilege and that the appellant had not defeated this defence. Since I have found that she reasonably held that the respondent established a defence of justification for the \u201cdisciplined for behaviours\u201d statement, I need only examine whether she reasonably concluded that the respondent established a defence of qualified privilege in respect of the \u201cdid not meet\u201d statement.\n[31] ADM Eid relied on Bent v. Platnick at paragraph 121 for the proposition that an occasion of qualified privilege exists if a person making a communication has a duty to publish the information to the person to whom it is published, and the recipient has a corresponding duty or interest in receiving it. She found that such an occasion exists when a senior LRA provides confidential advice to assist senior officers charged with making final level grievance decisions. In ADM Eid\u2019s view, the senior LRA who authored the memo was responsible for providing information, analysis and recommendations to the final level decision maker to assist in her deliberations on whether to allow or deny the grievance. ADM Eid found that the final level decision maker had a corresponding duty to receive this information \u201cto discharge [her] duties in an informed manner.\u201d\n[32] The appellant raised no convincing arguments to challenge ADM Eid\u2019s finding that qualified privilege attached to the occasion on which the senior LRA made the statements. Instead, the appellant argued that the defence of qualified privilege was defeated.\n[33] Following an analytical framework consistent with that laid out by the Supreme Court in Bent v. Platnick at paragraphs 128 and 136, ADM Eid found that the qualified privilege was not defeated because the appellant had failed to establish 1) that the scope of the privilege was exceeded because the statements were irrelevant to the work description grievance, or 2) that their author was motivated by malice.\n[34] In Bent v. Platnick, the Supreme Court noted, at paragraph 128, that qualified privilege may be defeated when the limits of the duty or interest have been exceeded. This may occur \u201cwhen the information communicated in a statement is not relevant to the discharge of the duty \u2026 giving rise to the privilege, or when the information is not reasonably appropriate to the legitimate purpose of the occasion\u201d [citations omitted]. It explained, at paragraph 136, that another way to defeat the defence of qualified privilege is to establish malice on the part of the person making the statement by showing an actual, express motive to speak dishonestly or reckless disregard for the truth.\n[35] The appellant submits that ADM Eid erred in dismissing his claim that the defence of qualified privilege was defeated because the statements were irrelevant to the work description grievance or because he had established malice on the part of the senior LRA who made the statements.\n[36] Before addressing this submission, I pause to note that at paragraphs 129 and 130 of Bent v. Platnick, in determining whether the publisher\u2019s inclusion in her communication of specific libellous references to Dr. Platnick exceeded the scope of qualified privilege, the majority asked whether naming Dr. Platnick in the communication was necessary to discharge the duty giving rise to the privilege. This has raised questions as to the place of \u201crelevance\u201d as distinguished from \u201cnecessity\u201d in the analysis of the scope of qualified privilege: see e.g. Thatcher-Craig v. Clearview (Township), 2023 ONCA 96, 480 D.L.R. (4th) 639 at para. 75, n. 2.\n[37] It is not necessary to canvass this issue further here. Firstly, the parties did not raise the question of necessity before this Court and took no issue with ADM Eid\u2019s focus on the relevance of the statements. Secondly, ADM Eid found that, in the specific labour relations context of this case, to fulfill the duty giving rise to the occasion of qualified privilege, the senior LRA was \u201crequired to give more information rather than less\u201d [emphasis added] to the final level decision maker. Since the senior LRA was duty-bound to give ADM Thivierge as much evidence as may be relevant to adjudicate the grievance in an informed manner, the requirements of relevance and necessity were coextensive. Accordingly, in light of ADM Eid\u2019s finding that evidence with respect to the PREA objectives and ratings was \u201cgenerally relevant to understanding duties performed in the context of a work description grievance,\u201d its publication became necessary. I am therefore satisfied that, while ADM Eid invoked the language of relevance rather than necessity in defining the scope of qualified privilege, her decision was nevertheless justified in relation to the relevant legal constraints that bore on her decision: Vavilov at para. 100.\n(1) ADM Eid reasonably found that the \u201cdid not meet\u201d statement was not irrelevant to the work description grievance [38] ADM Eid held that the communications did not exceed the scope of the qualified privilege. Examining relevance in the context of the connection between the senior LRA\u2019s statements and the privileged occasion, she found that \u201cevidence with respect to PREA objectives and ratings, and to performance more generally, is generally relevant to understanding duties actually performed in the context of a work description grievance.\u201d In finding that the statements fell within the scope of qualified privilege, ADM Eid emphasized that the senior LRA had testified that ADM Thivierge, the third level decision maker, \u201cwas very detail-oriented and expected more information rather than less from her advisors.\u201d\n[39] The appellant argued that a statement about the 2013-2014 PREA was not relevant to the work description grievance. Firstly, the PREA spoke to how well he had performed his duties, not whether the description of duties he was expected to perform was accurate. Secondly, it related to a time period subsequent to the employer\u2019s issuance in 2011 of the work description at issue in the grievance.\n[40] In the 2013-2014 PREA, appended to the memo, the appellant\u2019s supervisor set out a summary of the duties undertaken by the appellant that year (including, for example, managing the community pasture divestiture project and coordinating the work of a paralegal, junior counsel, and legal assistant). It also set out the appellant\u2019s objectives for that year (including, for example, assisting the Deputy Regional Director and Regional Director to triage requests for legal services and implementing the actions identified for the Prairie Regional Office in the Process Optimization initiative). At the hearing before this Court, the appellant recognized that some aspects of the PREA were potentially relevant to the work description grievance.\n[41] Although the 2013-2014 PREA postdates the employer\u2019s issuance of the 2011 work description, the memo documented that, at the second level of the work description grievance, the appellant\u2019s November 9, 2012, submissions argued that he routinely performed duties at an LP-03 level. For example, the appellant observed that client department officials in Ottawa consulted with him rather than their own department counsel because of his superior legal expertise in a wide range of issues. He submitted that he performed \u201cvery complex, sensitive, difficult and\/or legal file work\u201d that required the legal expertise and skills of senior or general counsel. The memo also documents that the precise nature of the appellant\u2019s current duties and responsibilities was in issue in deliberations that led to the October 4, 2013, second level response.\n[42] Accordingly, based on the record before her, it was reasonable for ADM Eid to conclude that the statement relating to the 2013-2014 PREA was not irrelevant to the appellant\u2019s work description grievance and to the discharge by the senior LRA of his duty to provide the final level decision maker with information to assist her in deciding the grievance.\n[43] This is so despite ADM Bernard\u2019s finding, in her March 26, 2019, decision dismissing the appellant\u2019s defamation grievance, that the information in the memo regarding the disciplinary action and the 2013-2014 PREA was \u201cnot relevant to the final level work description grievance.\u201d By allowing the appellant\u2019s application for judicial review of ADM Bernard\u2019s decision in Kohlenberg 2 and remitting it for reconsideration by a different decision maker, the Federal Court set aside that decision in its entirety and for all purposes: Burton v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 910, 245 A.C.W.S. (3d) 647 at para. 30; Ouellet v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FC 586, 280 A.C.W.S. (3d) 527 at paras. 27\u201328. ADM Eid was not bound in any way by that decision and was free to reach her own conclusions on the matters arising from the appellant\u2019s grievance. For these reasons, the appellant\u2019s argument that ADM Eid could not reasonably come to a different conclusion than ADM Bernard on the relevance of the 2013-2014 PREA cannot succeed.\n(2) ADM Eid reasonably found that the appellant did not establish that the statements were motivated by malice [44] ADM Eid rejected the appellant\u2019s claim that the statements were motivated by malice. She found that the evidence established that the senior LRA, who was \u201cas a matter of practice\u201d required to give his very detail-oriented senior manager more information rather than less, believed the statements to be true. In this context, she noted, the PREAs were potentially relevant to the work description grievance and the discipline was directly related to his PREA. Finally, the ADM observed that the senior LRA had denied there was any reason for him to prejudice the final level decision maker against the appellant.\n[45] The appellant argued before us that, in making the statements, the senior LRA sought to provide information to the final level decision maker that she might use to deny the grievance. This, in his view, was an improper ulterior motive amounting to malice. The respondent submitted that when the senior LRA recommended the appellant\u2019s grievance be dismissed based on his review of the evidence and applicable law and subject to submissions at the grievance hearing, and when he brought to ADM Thivierge\u2019s attention information that she might consider relevant to disposing of the grievance, he was simply performing the duty that gave rise to the occasion of qualified privilege.\n[46] In his submissions, the appellant essentially urges this Court to reweigh the evidence in the record regarding the presence of malice and to come to a different view than that of ADM Eid. This we cannot do. The appellant has not established that, in coming to her conclusion, ADM Eid fundamentally misapprehended or failed to account for the evidence before her. Based on this evidence, including the transcript of the appellant\u2019s cross-examination of the senior LRA, it was not unreasonable for her to conclude that the appellant had not established the statements were motivated by malice.\nIV. Conclusion [47] Given my conclusion that ADM Eid reasonably decided the respondent has established that the \u201cdisciplined for behaviours\u201d statement was substantially true and that the \u201cdid not meet\u201d statement occurred on an occasion of qualified privilege, it follows that her decision that the respondent had established defences to the appellant\u2019s defamation claim is reasonable.

Overview [1] By way of Judgment and Reasons for Judgment dated November 22, 2021 [Judgment], the Court allowed the appeal with costs in favour of the Appellant, the Attorney General of Canada.\n[2] Given that \u201c[c]osts shall be assessed by an assessment officer\u201d pursuant to section 405 of the Federal Courts Rules SOR\/98-106 [Rules], on February 29, 2024, the Appellant filed an assessment request along with their Bill of Costs, which initiated the assessment of costs (Rule 406). In the absence of any indication in the Judgment awarding costs, costs shall be taxed in accordance with column III of the Tariff B (Rule 407).\n[3] On March 4, 2024, a direction was issued to the parties regarding the conduct and filing of additional documents for the assessment of costs. On March 27, 2024, the Appellant filed a Costs Record which include an Affidavit of Disbursements and Written Representations, and on April 29, 2024, the Respondent filed their Responding Record. Having reviewed the Respondent\u2019s Record, the Appellant advised the Registry of the Federal Court of Appeal on April 30, 2024, that it did not intend to file written representations in reply.\n[4] Before proceeding with the assessment of costs, issues specific to this file must be addressed.\nII. Preliminary issues A. Should the Assessment Officer issue an order directing the Respondent to pay costs to the Appellant in the amount of $2,510.14? [5] Although the Appellant has initiated the assessment of costs by the filing of their Bill of Costs in accordance with Rule 406, in their Written Representations, they are requesting that the Court issue an order directing the Respondent to pay costs in the amount of $2,510.14 within 30 days of the issuance of the order.\n[6] As an assessment officer, I am not a member of the Court and I cannot issue such an order. Subsection 5(1) of the Federal Courts Act, RSC, 1985, c F-7, states that the Federal Court \u201cconsists of a chief justice [\u2026], an associate chief justice [\u2026] and 39 other judges\u201d, whereas Rule 2 defines an assessment officer as \u201can officer of the Registry.\u201d As mentioned by the assessment officer in Iris Technologies Inc. v. Canada (National Revenue), 2024 FC 906 at paragraph 9, \u201c[i]n their function, [assessment officers] are empowered to issue reasons for assessment and certificates of assessment. They cannot grant Orders or Judgments.\u201d\n[7] Nonetheless, it is not uncommon for litigants to misunderstand the role of assessment officers or the assessment of costs process itself as it is a very specific procedure. In this particular case, I am in possession of the Appellant costs material and it is clear that they wish to obtain a decision determining the amount of costs payable by the Respondent, which is not in dispute. While procedures are important for the orderly administration of justice, they should not be applied in a way that prevents them from addressing substantive issues, such as the assessment of costs. In the interest of the proper administration of justice and while respecting my jurisdiction, I will proceed with the assessment of costs in accordance with Part 11 of the Rules and issue these reasons along with a certificate of assessment.\nB. Pursuant to Rule 400(3)(h) and Rule 409, should the notion of public interest be considered in determining the level of cost? [8] As an assessment officer, I must determine the number of units that can be allowed based on the entire range of units set out in column III (Rule 407; Hoffman-La Roche Limited v. Apotex Inc., 2013 FC 1265 at para. 8). In doing so, I can apply the criteria listed in Rule 400(3) while taking into consideration that the default level of costs is the mid-point of column III in Tariff B (Allergan Inc. v. Sandoz Canada Inc., 2021 FC 186 at para. 25).\n[9] In their Written Representations, the Respondent argues that an \u201cassessment officer is not precluded from applying rules 409 and [4]00(3)(h) (public interest) to minimize the assessed costs.\u201d To support their position, the Respondent cites Hiebert v. Canada (Attorney General), 2006 FC 1215 at paragraph 5, which is appropriate to reproduce here :\nIn Bow Valley Naturalists Society et al. v. Minister of Canadian Heritage et al., [2002] F.C.J. No. 1795 (A.O.), I considered the relevance of public interest for assessments of costs and concluded that the application of Rules 409 and 400(3) factors against the interest of successful litigants would require carefully considered discretion. That a judgment for costs does not accord the unsuccessful litigant special consideration relative to costs as a function of public interest does not preclude me from applying Rule 409 and Rule 400(3)(h) (public interest) to minimize assessed costs. The Applicant\u2019s argument is compelling. However, I find nothing to suggest that the Court\u2019s analysis and findings concerning his institutional treatment would engage the public interest, i.e. by establishing precedent so pervasive as to significantly affect or alter the treatment of prisoners in the future. That is, the Applicant\u2019s interest in the outcome here was really of significance to only himself, i.e. the development of the best position for his early release.\n[10] While I defer entirely to the reasoning of the assessment officer in that case, my reasoning in this assessment of costs is to the same effect, that is, that I do not find anything in the Court\u2019s Judgment that would be of public interest. Moreover, the Respondent has not put forward any argument relevant to this case that would persuade me of the appropriateness of considering the mentioned criterion. In the absence of more substantiated arguments or guidance from the Court on the notion of public interest, I will not consider the criterion set out in Rule 400(3)(h) in assessing costs (Johnson v. Bell Canada, [2009] F.C.J. No. 1066 at para. 3). That being said, each item of Tariff B will still be assessed in its own circumstances (Starlight v. Canada, [2001] F.C.J. No. 1376 at para. 7).\nIII. Assessable services\n[11] The Appellant has claimed 13 units for assessable services, for a total amount of $1,950.00.\nA. Items 17, 18, 19, 20, 22(a) and 25 of Tariff B [12] After my review of the Appellant\u2019s Bill of Costs in conjunction with their Written Representations, the Court record and the Rules, I found the amounts claimed under Items 17, 18, 19, 20, 22(a) and 25 to be reasonable and the services performed to be necessary for the litigation of this Court file. Specifically, 1 unit is allowed for Items 17, 18, 20 and 25, 5 units are allowed for Item 19 and 2 units are allowed for Item 22(a).\nB. Item 21 \u2013 Counsel fee: (a) on a motion, including preparation, service and written representations or memorandum of fact and law [13] In their Bill of Costs, the Appellant has claimed a total of 2 units for the services rendered in relation with the following:\nAppellant\u2019s Motion Record and Reply Submissions \u2013 Interim and Interlocutory Stay of the Order of the Federal Court dated June 2, 2021 (granted costs in the Order of Justice Mactavish dated August 19, 2021).\nRespondent\u2019s Motion seeking orders declaring the Appellant in contempt in Court File Nos. A-310-20, A-134-21, A-163-21, A-164-21, A-175-21 (granted costs in the Order of Justice Mactavish dated August 19, 2021).\n[14] My review of the Court record indicates that the Appellant is entitled to costs following the order of August 19, 2021, as the costs of their Motion for Interim and Interlocutory Stay of the Order of the Federal Court dated June 1, 2021, were awarded in the cause.\n[15] As for the Respondent\u2019s Motion seeking orders declaring the Appellant in contempt, no order was specifically rendered addressing this issue. For that purpose, the Respondent indicates in their Written Representations that their Motion Record in relation with the Appellant\u2019s contempt was withdrawn on September 2, 2021, and therefore, they should not be ordered to pay the related costs. I note, however, that in the Appellant's Bill of Costs, no units are specifically claimed for this motion. Rather, the 2 units claimed seem to relate exclusively to the Motion for Interim and Interlocutory Stay of the Order of the Federal Court dated June 1, 2021.\n[16] In a context where the Appellant is entitled to the costs of the Motion for Interim and Interlocutory Stay of the Order of the Federal Court dated June 1, 2021, and the minimum number of units has been claimed under Item 21(a), it would be pointless to pursue further the assessment of this claim. The two-unit claim under Item 21(a) is allowed as it is.\nC. Total amount allowed for the Appellant\u2019s assessable services [17] A total of 13 units have been allowed for the Appellant\u2019s assessable services totalling $1,950.00.\nIV. Disbursements [18] The Appellant has claimed $560.14 as disbursements. After my review of the Appellant\u2019s Costs Record, the Court file and the Rules, I accept the amounts claimed for court fees ($50.00) and servicing fees ($63.00) as they are both substantiated in accordance with subsection 1(4) of Tariff B. These claims do not require further consideration and are allowed as they are. The costs associated with photocopying, on the other hand, require a more in-depth analysis.\nA. Photocopies [19] The Appellant has claimed a total of $447.14 ($359.37 and $87.77) for copying fees related to the Appeal Book and Joint Book of Authorities. These claims are supported by the invoices provided in Exhibit D and E of the Affidavit of Disbursements affirmed on March 27, 2024, by Breanne Peacock. Apart from a mere mention in the Appellant\u2019s Bill of Costs that the photocopies were \u201ccounsel copies for hearing,\u201d no written submissions were filed in support of these claims.\n[20] In their Written Representations, the Respondent argues that \u201c[t]his was a remote hearing with electronic filing. Three photocopies of the authorities and two copies of the appeal book were not reasonable.\u201d While I reach the same conclusion as the Respondent, my reasoning takes a somewhat different approach.\n[21] Subsection 1(4) of Tariff B of the Rules states that \u201c[n]o disbursement [\u2026] shall be assessed or allowed under this Tariff unless it is reasonable [\u2026]\u201d. In addition to subsection 1(4) of Tariff B, case law has also established that in matters of assessment of disbursements, the successful party may claim disbursements that are reasonable and necessary for the litigation (Merck & Co. Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2006 FC 631 at para. 3).\n[22] Although it is given that the photocopies costs claimed were indeed incurred by the Appellant, the claim having been substantiated by documentary evidence, the question of whether these expenses were necessary and reasonable for the conduct of the litigation remains.\n[23] Having review the Court file, I note that an electronic copy of the Appeal Book was filed by the Appellant on August 9, 2021. No paper copy was provided to the Registry for the judiciary. As for the Joint Book of Authorities, a single paper copy was filed with the Registry by the Appellant on October 12, 2021.\n[24] Regardless, the Bill of Costs specifies that the photocopy claim in the amount of $359.37 was intended for two counsel present at the hearing. Tariff B provides for compensation of the second counsel\u2019s assessable services only, \u201cwhere Court directs\u201d (Item 22(b)). Since assessable services and disbursements are inherently linked, and given that the Judgment or any direction therein does not allow for the costs related to a second counsel to be claimed, I do not have the authority to award such costs. As an assessment officer, I can only allow assessable services and their associated disbursements \u201cif they have been previously awarded by the Court\u201d (Mugford v. Nunatsiavut (First Minister), 2012 FC 821, at para. 9).\n[25] Considering the above, the Appellant is only entitled to one copy of the Joint Book of Authorities and Appeal Book for counsel during the hearing, and one additional paper copy of the Joint Book of Authorities for the registry. The claim for $87.77 is allowed as is it reasonable and necessary. However, the claim for $359.37 is halved to cover the cost of a single copy of each document, resulting in a total of $267.46 for photocopies.\nB. Total amount allowed for the Appellant\u2019s disbursements [26] A total of $380.46 is allowed for the Appellant\u2019s disbursements.\nV. Conclusion [27] For the above reasons, the Appellant\u2019s Bill of Costs is assessed and allowed at $2,330.46. A Certificate of Assessment will be issued.\n\u201cAudrey Blanchet\u201d\nAssessment Officer\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-164-21\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA v.

Introduction [1] The Applicants, Little Black Bear First Nation (Little Black Bear) and Star Blanket First Nation (Star Blanket), seek judicial review of a Decision of the Specific Claims Tribunal (Tribunal) reported as Kawacatoose First Nation v. Canada, 2019 SCTC 3.\n[2] The Decision by the Honourable W.L. Whalen determined which First Nations were beneficiaries of Indian Reserve No. IR 80A (IR 80A). The reserve, whose Indigenous name is Kinookimaw, was created in 1889 by Order in Council PC 1151 (PC 1151), and was described simply as a \u201cFishing Station for the use of the Touchwood Hills and Qu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians.\u201d The Decision turned on the proper interpretation of this phrase.\n[3] The Tribunal concluded that of the 11 First Nations purporting to be beneficiaries, either as Indians of the Touchwood Hills or Qu\u2019Appelle Valley, 8 of the 11 were beneficiaries. The two Applicants are among the First Nations who were denied beneficiary status.\n[4] The Crown took no position before the Tribunal or this Court on who the proper beneficiaries were. In this Court, submissions were made by the Applicants, as well as two First Nations who were accorded beneficiary status by the Tribunal, those being Kawacatoose First Nation (Kawacatoose) and Standing Buffalo Dakota First Nation (Standing Buffalo).\n[5] The primary issue in these applications is whether the Court should set aside the Tribunal\u2019s decision in so far as it excluded Little Black Bear and Star Blanket from the class of beneficiaries. For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the applications.\nII. Background A. Procedural history [6] There is a larger context to the Decision under review. Determining who the beneficiaries of IR 80A were will resolve a larger question of who the Crown owed duties to upon a purported surrender of the reserve in 1918. Alleged breaches of these duties are the subject of a claim (Claim) before the Tribunal.\n[7] The Claim was bifurcated into two phases. These judicial review applications concern the Tribunal\u2019s standing sub-phase, in which the Tribunal determined which of the First Nations alleging to be beneficiaries would be accorded standing to pursue the Claim.\nB. Parties [8] In these reasons, First Nations are sometimes referred to as \u201cIndian Bands\u201d or \u201cBands\u201d, and their individual members are occasionally referred to as \u201cIndians\u201d. This terminology corresponds with the historical records that form part of the evidence and is used solely to avoid confusion.\n[9] Before the Tribunal, the parties included 11 First Nations (Claimants) who sought to have standing in the Claim. The Crown was the sole respondent.\n[10] In this Court, the Applicants are Little Black Bear and Star Blanket, and the remaining 9 First Nations and the Crown are Respondents.\n[11] I sometimes refer to the Claimants by the geographic location of their residential reserves. These locations are set out in the chart below, and are reflected in a map of the region appended to these reasons.\nTouchwood Hills Bands\nDay Star, George Gordon, Muskowekwan, and Kawacatoose First Nations\nQu\u2019Appelle River\/Lake Bands\nPasqua, Muscowpetung, Piapot, and Standing Buffalo First Nations\nFile Hills Bands\nLittle Black Bear, Star Blanket, and Peepeekisis First Nations\n[12] I also sometimes refer to a subgroup consisting of seven First Nations who the Crown historically recognized as being beneficiaries of IR 80A. These were the Bands that the Crown considered as Indians of the Touchwood Hills or Qu\u2019Appelle Valley. This subgroup was referred to by the Tribunal as the \u201cKawacatoose Group\u201d. I use the same terminology in these reasons. The Bands in this group are the Bands located in the Touchwood Hills and the Qu\u2019Appelle River\/Lake area, with the exception of Standing Buffalo who was not recognized by the Crown as being a beneficiary. It is noteworthy that the File Hills Bands, which include the Applicants, are not in the Kawacatoose Group.\nC. Treaty 4 [13] Historically, the Claimants were nomadic peoples in what is now southern Saskatchewan who followed a migratory route through the Qu\u2019Appelle region. All but one of the Claimants are Cree and Saulteaux people. The lone exception is Standing Buffalo, who are Dakota\/Sioux.\n[14] In 1874, all the Claimants except Standing Buffalo entered into Treaty 4 with Canada. Treaty 4 encompasses a large geographic area in parts of what are now Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba.\n[15] All of the Claimants were provided with residential reserves in the larger Qu\u2019Appelle region. The Cree and Saulteaux Claimants were entitled to the reserves pursuant to Treaty 4. Standing Buffalo did not enter into any Treaty, and was independently provided with a reserve in consideration of services it rendered to the Crown.\n[16] The relevant text of Treaty 4 provides that reserves will be assigned by the Crown, after conference with each Band, and the Indians will have the right to pursue fishing and other avocations throughout the ceded area, except on tracts taken up by the Crown for other purposes. These provisions are reproduced below.\nAnd Her Majesty the Queen hereby agrees, through the said Commissioners, to assign reserves for said Indians, such reserves to be selected by officers of Her Majesty\u2019s Government of the Dominion of Canada appointed for that purpose, after conference with each band of the Indians, and to be of sufficient area to allow one square mile for each family of five, or in that proportion for larger or smaller families \u2026\n\u2026\nAnd further, Her Majesty agrees that Her said Indians shall have right to pursue their avocations of hunting, trapping and fishing throughout the tract surrendered, subject to such regulations as may from time to time be made by the Government of the country, acting under the authority of Her Majesty, and saving and excepting such tracts as may be required or taken up from time to time for settlement, mining or other purposes, under grant or other right given by Her Majesty\u2019s said Government.\nD. Process of reserve creation [17] The boundaries of the Claimants\u2019 reserves were determined by surveys. Much of the surveyors\u2019 work, which began on the ground around 1876, ultimately translated into the confirmation of the Claimants\u2019 reserves in PC 1151.\n[18] PC 1151 was an omnibus Order in Council, which formally approved a great many reserves. It comprised a total of 84 residential reserves for individual Bands, two fishing stations, one hay ground and two timber limits (Decision at para. 52).\n[19] Fishing station reserves were first developed in 1881 to replace a system of designating entire lakes for the exclusive use of First Nations for fishing. The reserves were tracts of land along bodies of water for the exclusive use of designated Bands so as to provide access to fishing (Decision at para. 28). Whereas residential reserves were set aside for a particular Band, these special use reserves were sometimes for more than one Band.\n[20] PC 1151 contained copies of all the reserves\u2019 plans of survey, with the name of the surveyor and the signature of John C. Nelson indicating that, as the person in charge of reserve surveys, he had checked and approved them. Mr. Nelson, himself a Dominion Land Surveyor, had also surveyed many of the Claimants\u2019 reserves, including IR 80A.\nE. Creation of IR 80A [21] The first reference in the record to a fishing station at IR 80A was in a list of as yet unsurveyed reserves dated January 1, 1883 and prepared by Mr. Nelson. It identified the reserve as a \u201cfishing station of 320 acres for Qu\u2019Appelle and Touchwood Indians\u201d to be surveyed at Last Mountain Lake.\n[22] On June 5, 1884, Mr. Nelson reported to the Office of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs that he had visited the Long or Last Mountain Lake to set aside \u201cfishing stations for the Touchwood Hills and Qu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians.\u201d While he identified the location for the fishing station, he did not survey it at that time. The location was near Last Mountain Lake and the Qu\u2019Appelle River.\n[23] The survey for IR 80A was completed in 1885, at which time Mr. Nelson reported to the Indian Commissioner that he had surveyed \u201ca fishing station for the Touchwood Hills and Qu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians.\u201d This description matched the wording in PC 1151, which is at issue in these applications.\nF. Purported surrender of IR 80A [24] In the early 1900s, the Department of Indian Affairs (Department) began considering a disposition of IR 80A. Surrender documents were purportedly signed by the seven chiefs of the Kawacatoose Group, and the surrender was confirmed in 1918 by PC 1815.\n[25] Subsequent to the purported surrender, the land was subdivided and a number of lots were sold. The distribution of the proceeds to the Kawacatoose Group sparked a discussion within the Department on entitlement as some of the Claimants expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome. One concern that resonated with some Department officials was that the File Hills Bands should have been included as \u201cQu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u201d and beneficiaries of IR 80A because their reserves were not in close proximity to fishing lakes (Decision at para. 70). However, the Department\u2019s position that the Bands belonging to the Kawacatoose Group were the only intended beneficiaries of IR 80A did not change. Some of the Bands continued to express dissatisfaction at least up until 1954.\nG. Decision of the Tribunal [26] As mentioned earlier, when a Claim was instigated against the Crown regarding its administration of IR 80A\u2019s surrender, the Tribunal had to first decide which of the Claimants were beneficiaries of the reserve and therefore had standing to continue in the litigation.\n[27] The Tribunal concluded that, in addition to the seven First Nations in the Kawacatoose Group, the only other beneficiary was Standing Buffalo. None of the File Hills Bands were included. Little Black Bear and Star Blanket seek to set aside the Decision in so far as it determined that they were not beneficiaries.\n[28] The Decision is described more fully below.\nIII. Issue [29] The issue is whether the Decision should be set aside with respect to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the Applicants were not beneficiaries of IR 80A. The issue is not whether the Applicants should have been included as beneficiaries, but is whether they actually were.\nIV. Standard of review [30] The Decision will be reviewed on the deferential standard of reasonableness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov]; Williams Lake Indian Band v. Canada (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development), 2018 SCC 4 [Williams Lake]).\n[31] The approach to reasonableness review articulated by the Supreme Court in Vavilov is concerned with both the decision-making process as well as the outcome reached (Vavilov at para. 83).\n[32] The following principles from Vavilov are particularly useful in reviewing this Decision:\n(i)The \u201cburden is on the party challenging the decision to show that it is unreasonable.\u201d \u201c[A]ny shortcomings or flaws relied on by the party challenging the decision [must be] sufficiently central or significant to render the decision unreasonable.\u201d (Vavilov at para. 100);\n(ii)A decision will be unreasonable if the reasoning process is not rational or logical. In particular, \u201ca decision will be unreasonable if the reasons for it, read holistically, fail to reveal a rational chain of analysis or if they reveal that the decision was based on an irrational chain of analysis \u2026\u201d (Vavilov at para. 103);\n(iii)A decision will also be unreasonable when the \u201cdecision is in some respect untenable in light of the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on it.\u201d (Vavilov at para. 101); and\n(iv)With respect to factual determinations, generally the court must \u201crefrain from \u2018reweighing and reassessing the evidence considered by the decision maker\u2019.\u201d However, \u201c[t]he decision maker must take the evidentiary record and the general factual matrix that bears on its decision into account, and its decision must be reasonable in light of them. \u2026 The reasonableness of a decision may be jeopardized where the decision maker has fundamentally misapprehended or failed to account for the evidence before it.\u201d (Vavilov at paras. 125, 126).\n[33] The reasonableness standard of review as applied to decisions of the Specific Claims Tribunal was considered by the Supreme Court in Williams Lake, which was decided a year prior to Vavilov. The Court commented that reviewing judges should be aware of the particular challenges faced by the Specific Claims Tribunal when it resolves legal issues arising from the application of legal principles and doctrines to historical claims and noted that the Specific Claims Tribunal is particularly suited to adjudicate these issues (Williams Lake at paras. 34-35).\nV. Analysis [34] This analysis is divided into two parts. First, I set out the relevant findings made by the Tribunal. Then, I analyze whether the Decision is reasonable.\nA. Tribunal\u2019s findings [35] The relevant findings of the Tribunal are set out below under the following headings used by the Tribunal:\nOverview of law\nConclusions on oral history evidence\nAnalysis of the documentary record\nChanges in Agency administration and later administrative confusion\nUse of IR 80A and the pass system\nConcluding comments\n(1) Overview of law [36] The Tribunal provided an overview of the legal principles which, in its view, bore on the issues before it. The overview also commented on how some of the legal principles should be applied in the case. Below, I summarize central aspects of this overview.\n[37] The Tribunal first set out general principles of interpretation. Relying on Osoyoos Indian Band v. Oliver (Town), 2001 SCC 85 [Osoyoos], the Tribunal concluded that an Order in Council should be interpreted based on principles of statutory interpretation. It then stated the well-known approach to statutory interpretation: \u201c[W]ords of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament\u201d (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, 54 D.L.R. (4th) 193 at para. 21, citing Driedger, Construction of Statutes, 2nd ed. (Toronto, Butterworths, 1983) at 87).\n[38] The Tribunal also considered principles applicable in determining whether a reserve has been created. In one authority, Ross River Dena Council Band v. Canada, 2002 SCC 54, at paragraph 67, the Supreme Court instructed that the Crown must have an intention to create a reserve. The Tribunal concluded that the jurisprudence places great emphasis on Crown intent in resolving questions about reserve creation.\n[39] The Tribunal also reviewed a decision with an issue similar to these applications: Canada (Attorney General) v. Anishnabe of Wauzhushk Onigum Band, [2003] 1 C.N.L.R. 6, 2002 CanLII 15761 (ON SC) [Anishnabe], aff\u2019d [2004] 1 C.N.L.R. 35, 2003 CanLII 13835 (ON CA) [Anishnabe OCA]. In Anishnabe, the Court interpreted an Order in Council setting aside a reserve under Treaty 3 \u201cfor the Saulteaux Tribe, generally\u201d in order to determine which specific Bands were the beneficial owners of the reserve. The Tribunal noted that, in this context also, the Court in Anishnabe focused its analysis on determining the Crown\u2019s intention in creating the reserve.\n[40] The Tribunal also discussed interpretive principles applicable to statutory provisions that impact Indigenous interests. These are to generously interpret ambiguous provisions, and to approach such provisions in a manner that upholds the honour of the Crown. The Tribunal (at paragraph 145) reproduced the general description of these principles from R. v. Badger, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 771 at paragraph 41:\n[41] First, it must be remembered that a treaty represents an exchange of solemn promises between the Crown and the various Indian nations. It is an agreement whose nature is sacred. \u2026 Second, the honour of the Crown is always at stake in its dealing with Indian people. Interpretations of treaties and statutory provisions which have an impact upon treaty or aboriginal rights must be approached in a manner which maintains the integrity of the Crown. It is always assumed that the Crown intends to fulfil its promises. \u2026 Third, any ambiguities or doubtful expressions in the wording of the treaty or document must be resolved in favour of the Indians. A corollary to this principle is that any limitations which restrict the rights of Indians under treaties must be narrowly construed.\n[41] With respect to the interpretation of ambiguous provisions, the Tribunal also set out the principle of generous interpretation from Osoyoos at paragraph 68, which involved the interpretation of an Order in Council:\n[68] \u2026 if two approaches to the interpretation and application of an enactment are reasonably sustainable as a matter of law, then the interpretation or application that impairs the Indian interests as little as possible should be preferred, so long as the ambiguity is a genuine one, and the construction that is favourable to the Indian interests is one that the enactment will reasonably bear, having regard to the legislative purposes of the enactment \u2026\n[42] With respect to honour of the Crown, at paragraph 147 of the Decision the Tribunal referred also to the following excerpts from Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14 [Manitoba Metis]:\n[147] . . . \u201cThe honour of the Crown requires the Crown to act in a way that accomplishes the intended purposes of treaty and statutory grants to Aboriginal peoples . . .\u201d (para 73(4)). The Court continued that the \u201chonour of the Crown demands that constitutional obligations to Aboriginal peoples be given a broad, purposive interpretation\u201d, and the \u201chonour of the Crown requires it to act diligently in pursuit of its solemn obligations and the honourable reconciliation of Crown and Aboriginal interests\u201d.\n[43] Finally, the Tribunal considered precedents on the use of oral history evidence in the adjudication of historical claims. The Tribunal employed the term \u201cIndigenous perspectives\u201d to describe the perspectives of the First Nation Elders and life speakers (Elders) who appeared as witnesses, regardless of whether or not the information was passed down by ancestors or these witnesses had personal knowledge.\n[44] The Tribunal noted that the oral history authorities referred to by the parties arose in a different context \u2013 Indigenous rights and title litigation. However, it observed that \u201cthe principles of necessity, reliability, relevance, and reconciliation are not logically restricted to that setting.\u201d (Decision at para. 153).\n[45] Ultimately, the Tribunal concluded that since the interpretation of the Order in Council turns on the Crown\u2019s intent, the oral history evidence should be considered from the perspective of whether it had a bearing on the intent of the Crown. Paragraph 166 of the Decision provides an example of where the Tribunal adopted this approach:\n[166] . . . If, however, the Crown\u2019s intent was found on the facts to include some but not all of the Claimants in PC 1151, then a Claimant\u2019s sense of itself as belonging to, or having belonged to, the \u201cQu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u201d would not change that intention. Nor can the law relating to treaty interpretation, honour of the Crown and fiduciary obligations retroactively revise an order in council that the evidence clearly established had a more limited focus.\n(2) Conclusions on oral history evidence [46] The Tribunal heard evidence from 14 Elders called by some of the Claimants to testify as to their First Nation\u2019s use of, sense of entitlement to, and historical relationship with IR 80A.\n[47] The Tribunal found that, in sharing their Indigenous perspectives, the Elders had \u201caccurately recounted the information passed down to them\u201d (Decision at para. 250). However, the Tribunal also concluded that the Elders had different understandings regarding the entitlement of their First Nations and other First Nations to IR 80A. The oral history evidence of the witnesses \u201cconflicted from one First Nation to another as well as internally among witnesses from the same First Nation\u201d (Decision at para. 245). The Tribunal comments that the differences, variations and inconsistencies \u201cundermined their evidence, both on an individual and overall basis\u201d (Decision at paras. 249, 251). This finding included the Applicants\u2019 witnesses (Decision at paras. 245-246).\n[48] In addition to its comment concerning inconsistencies, the Tribunal expressed skepticism about the testimony of some of the Claimants that their entitlement to IR 80A stemmed from an oral promise that was part of, or related to, Treaty 4. The Tribunal stated that this testimony came \u201cwith little elaboration or underlying factual basis\u201d and the evidence as presented \u201cwas not sufficiently developed to support a finding that a promise of fishing station reserves was made at the time of Treaty adherence\u2026\u201d (Decision at para. 252).\n[49] Finally, the Tribunal discussed evidence to the effect that all Claimants used IR 80A. The Tribunal found that this evidence demonstrated all Claimants had a strong attachment to IR 80A through their historical use and cultural perspective. However, it added that this attachment would not be enough to establish entitlement to IR 80A \u201cunless it can be shown that the Crown was aware of it and was motivated to act upon it.\u201d (Decision at para. 262).\n(3) Analysis of the documentary record [50] The Tribunal commenced its consideration of the documentary record by stating that its focus was to determine the Crown\u2019s intent in enacting PC 1151 (Decision at para. 264). To undertake this task, the Tribunal meticulously reviewed a large number of documents.\n[51] From this review the Tribunal made two important findings. First, \u201c[Mr. Nelson\u2019s] intention in creating the [IR 80A] survey and describing it must surely govern in the sense that his work was the basis for PC 1151, which was in turn the stamp of approval of the content he had generated.\u201d Second, Mr. Nelson did not intend to include the File Hills Bands as beneficiaries of this reserve. \u201cHis intention was that IR 80A would be for the shared benefit of the bands residing in the geographic area known as the Touchwood Hills, and also in the Qu\u2019Appelle Valley itself along the shores of the Qu\u2019Appelle River or Lakes.\u201d (Decision at paras. 268, 289, 293, 300).\n[52] At paragraph 301 of the Decision, the Tribunal discussed the role played by Indigenous perspectives in the selection of the beneficiaries of IR 80A. In this regard, the Tribunal acknowledged that the Claimants had self-identified as Indians of the Qu\u2019Appelle region. However, the Tribunal stated that \u201cMr. Nelson\u2019s perspective and underlying intent were informed by geography and a professional surveyor\u2019s mandate in relation to situating bands on particular land within a particular time frame. The Indigenous perspectives were informed by the broad sweep of their histories and traditions. \u2026 The Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives apparently developed and thrived separately from each other, without connection or adoption by one culture or the other.\u201d The Tribunal concluded that there was no evidence that \u201cMr. Nelson took a more inclusive view of \u2018Qu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u2019.\u201d\n(4) Changes in Agency administration and later administrative confusion [53] The Government set up Agencies to administer groups of Bands located in a particular area. The Tribunal noted that, during and following the period of reserve creation, the Agencies which administered the Claimants were reorganized on several occasions. This resulted in the names of the Agencies that administered the File Hills Bands and the Touchwood Hills Bands being changed from time to time. For example, the File Hills Bands were at times administered by the Qu\u2019Appelle Agency and at other times by the File Hills Agency. Similarly, the Touchwood Hills Bands were sometimes administered by the Qu\u2019Appelle Agency and at other times by the Touchwood Hills Agency.\n[54] The Tribunal commented that these changes might have caused confusion and misunderstanding among the Claimants and some government officials as to the meaning of \u201cTouchwood Hills and Qu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u201d in PC 1151. However, the Tribunal concluded that the names of the Agencies did not affect the Crown\u2019s intent with respect to IR 80A. The Crown adopted Mr. Nelson\u2019s perspective, which was geographic, not administrative (Decision at paras. 298-299).\n[55] The Tribunal also considered events that took place after IR 80A was confirmed by PC 1151. In the early 1900s, a decade after IR 80A was created, the government decided to seek a surrender of the reserve. In 1913, the Crown sought surrenders from the Bands that now comprise the Kawacatoose Group. They did not seek surrenders from the File Hills Bands. (Decision at paras. 67, 303).\n[56] A debate then developed within the Department as to who the beneficiaries of IR 80A were. The Touchwood Hills Bands had voiced the view that the File Hills Bands also had an interest in the reserve. Some Department officials had sympathy for this view because the File Hills Bands, like the Touchwood Hills Bands, did not border on a fishing lake. However, the Department did not accept this view. (Decision at para. 304).\n[57] The Tribunal noted that, despite the differing views described above, the Department never changed its view that the beneficiaries were the seven First Nations comprising the Kawacatoose Group, and this view was consistently maintained by senior Department officials and surveyors (Decision at para. 304).\n[58] The Tribunal concluded that the Department\u2019s view was the correct one, and it was consistent with Mr. Nelson\u2019s intent, with the exception of the exclusion of Standing Buffalo. The Tribunal determined that Standing Buffalo had been improperly excluded by the Department on the basis that the Band was American Sioux. As Standing Buffalo\u2019s reserve was in the Qu\u2019Appelle Valley, it had a beneficial interest in IR 80A. (Decision at paras. 307-309).\n(5) Use of IR 80A and the pass system [59] The Tribunal considered that several Bands used IR 80A after it was surveyed and formally set aside. It found that the Claimants did not pay great attention to boundaries at the time and they moved about each other\u2019s reserves. The Tribunal determined that this did not confer beneficiary status under PC 1151 (Decision at paras. 311-312).\n[60] The Tribunal also commented on the relevance of the pass system, a brutal and illegal policy brought in by the Department around 1885 following the Riel Rebellion. The effect of the policy was that the government at its discretion could restrict the movement of First Nations\u2019 people outside their assigned reserves. The Tribunal noted that the overall use of IR 80A was diminished by both the imposition of the pass system and the forced transition of Indigenous people from a nomadic way of life to a controlled, stationary and agrarian existence. Nevertheless, the Tribunal found that the pass system had no effect on the entitlement to benefit from IR 80A (Decision at para. 313).\n(6) Concluding comments [61] The Tribunal provided concluding comments in its reasons. The relevant comments at paragraphs 315-323 include important findings which are outlined below.\n[62] First, as \u201cthe authorized surveyor,\u201d Mr. Nelson was attentive to the nature and character of the land he surveyed. He consulted with the leadership of the Bands for which he was surveying reserves. He also \u201ctried to understand the needs of the communities he was serving and he was consistently accommodating in this region.\u201d (Decision at para. 315).\n[63] Second, Mr. Nelson was not aware of the File Hills Bands\u2019 need for a fishing station at any relevant time, including when he surveyed IR 80A and supervised its confirmation. \u201cHad he been [aware], or had he been asked for a fishing station or inclusion in IR 80A, I think it probable that he would have tried to accommodate.\u201d In addition, \u201cthere was no evidence that the File Hills Bands experienced difficulty obtaining fish, other than the interference created by the pass system and imposed on all Bands in the District.\u201d (Decision at paras. 316-317).\n[64] Third, the perspective of the File Hills Bands did not change Mr. Nelson\u2019s \u201cmotivation and intent\u201d with respect to IR 80A. \u201cNone of the principles of interpretation, applied liberally and to the best advantage of the File Hills Bands, can expand Mr. Nelson\u2019s intent \u2026\u201d Mr. Nelson understood the Touchwood Hills, File Hills and Qu\u2019Appelle Valley as three distinct geographic locations. (Decision at para. 318).\n[65] Fourth, \u201cCanada treated the benefits of IR 80A as Mr. Nelson had intended them, and it was consistent in doing so.\u201d (Decision at para. 319).\n[66] Fifth, the Tribunal had difficulty accepting some Elders\u2019 testimony that there were oral promises of fishing stations around the time Treaty 4 was negotiated. The concluding comments provide three reasons for this: the evidence of such promises was \u201climited and conflicting\u201d; there was nothing to indicate that the device of the fishing station had been conceived of at the time of the signing of Treaty 4; and the Tribunal believed that the oral promise of a fishing station would have been a more prominent, common and consistent feature of the Elders\u2019 testimony if such promises had been made. (Decision at para. 320).\n[67] Sixth, there was no evidence that the Indigenous community had difficulty accessing fishing grounds or catching adequate amounts of fish. While the pass system controlled access, it did not eliminate it. All of the Claimants used IR 80A; they were not excluded by the Crown or the First Nations in the Kawacatoose Group. Further, how the Crown administered the surrender of IR 80A was beyond the scope of the standing sub-phase (Decision at para. 321).\n[68] Seventh, the pre-contact perspective of the Claimants does not directly assist in the interpretation of PC 1151 and the wording used in IR 80A. Unlike Treaty 4, which was a joint framework, \u201creserves were entities devised by the Crown according to Anglophone common law legal structures.\u201d (Decision at para. 322).\n[69] Eighth, as for whether ambiguities around the Crown\u2019s intentions regarding entitlement to IR 80A should be resolved in favour of the Applicants because the Crown\u2019s records were poor, there was no evidence that the records were of such a state to engage this principle. In any event, \u201cthe subject ambiguity was capable of clarification on the basis of the evidence adduced.\u201d (Decision at para. 323).\nB. Is the Decision unreasonable? (1) Introduction [70] The Applicants have the burden to show that the Decision is unreasonable. In general, a decision may be unreasonable if it is untenable in light of the relevant factual or legal constraints, or if it fails to reveal a rational chain of analysis.\n[71] Accordingly, the analysis below considers the submissions of the Applicants. As far as I am able to discern, the Applicants do not submit that the Decision is irrational. They only allege that it contains factual and legal flaws.\n[72] Before proceeding further, I would mention that it is not enough for the Applicants to demonstrate that the Decision contained a legal or factual flaw. In light of the principles from Vavilov summarized above, they must also show that the flaw is significant enough to render the Decision unreasonable.\n[73] I have tried to read the Decision holistically, and find that the Tribunal\u2019s concluding comments are helpful in understanding the reasoning process. These comments appear to summarize how the Tribunal reached its conclusion after a meticulous consideration of the evidence and the law.\n[74] Although the Tribunal considered a number of issues, the outcome of the case is predicated on two central conclusions. First, the beneficiaries of IR 80A as described in PC 1151 should be determined in accordance with the intention of the Crown. Second, the Crown did not intend that the beneficiaries of IR 80A include the Applicants. If the Decision is unreasonable, it is likely because one of these findings is unreasonable.\n[75] I turn now to the Applicants\u2019 arguments.\n(2) Did the Tribunal unreasonably find that PC 1151 was not ambiguous? [76] The Applicants submit that the Tribunal unreasonably found that the phrase \u201cthe Touchwood Hills and Qu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u201d is not ambiguous. They submit that the term \u201cQu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u201d is ambiguous and that the Tribunal should have interpreted it in their favour by finding it included the File Hills Bands.\n[77] The Tribunal reasoned that, although the words by themselves are ambiguous, the ambiguity is resolved by the evidentiary record. The Tribunal did not express any doubts about this. It stated that it was \u201cquite satisfied\u201d with the conclusion. (Decision at paras. 300, 323).\n[78] I will first address a submission of Little Black Bear that the Tribunal did not apply the proper principle in determining whether there is an ambiguity sufficient to engage the interpretive presumption in favour of the Applicants. Little Black Bear submits that the ambiguity is obvious since Mr. Nelson never articulated the individual Bands for which IR 80A was intended and this was never definitively resolved.\n[79] I do not agree. The essence of Little Black Bear\u2019s submission is that an ambiguity on the face of PC 1151 is sufficient to warrant applying a presumption in its favour. However, the Tribunal did not adopt this view and reasonably supported its approach at paragraphs 139-141 of the Decision.\n[80] At paragraph 141 of the Decision, the Tribunal referred to the principle discussed in Osoyoos at paragraph 68. There, the Supreme Court stated that the presumption that courts should prefer the interpretation of an enactment that \u201cimpairs the Indian interests as little as possible\u201d will apply only \u201cif two approaches to the interpretation and application of an enactment are reasonably sustainable as a matter of law\u201d [emphasis added]. The ambiguity must be \u201ca genuine one\u201d and the construction favourable to Indian interests must be \u201cone that the enactment will reasonably bear, having regard to the legislative purposes of the enactment.\u201d As for whether an interpretation should be considered sustainable as a matter of law, the Supreme Court recently confirmed the proper test in La Presse inc. v. Quebec, 2023 SCC 22 [La Presse]. At paragraph 24 of La Presse, Wagner C.J. stated:\n[24] Second, a provision is only \u201cambiguous\u201d in the sense contemplated in Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, if its words can reasonably be interpreted in more than one way after due consideration of the context in which they appear and of the purpose of the provision (paras. 29-30). This is to say that there is a \u201creal\u201d ambiguity \u2014 one that calls for the use of external interpretive aids like the principle of strict construction of penal laws or the presumption of conformity with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \u2014 only if differing readings of the same provision cannot be decisively resolved through the contextual and purposive approach set out by Driedger (ibid.).\n[81] The Tribunal\u2019s approach took into account the text, context and purpose surrounding PC 1151 for the purpose of construing the description of IR 80A and assessing whether there was a genuine ambiguity. This approach was reasonable when viewed in light of these authorities.\n[82] The Applicants also submit that, even if the proper principles were applied, the evidentiary record does not resolve the ambiguity. In my view, the Tribunal\u2019s finding to the contrary was also reasonable. In its interpretation of PC 1151, the Tribunal undertook an extensive consideration of the evidence and provided cogent reasons for its conclusion that the evidentiary record clearly resolves the ambiguity. There is no reasonable basis for this Court to reweigh or reassess this evidence.\n[83] I would examine in particular three of the Applicants\u2019 arguments that the evidentiary record does not resolve the ambiguity. My focus will be on whether the Tribunal has \u201cfundamentally misapprehended or failed to account for the evidence before it.\u201d (Vavilov at para. 126).\n[84] First, the Applicants submit that \u201cthe Touchwood Hills and Qu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u201d could be a reference to Indian Agencies rather than geographic areas as the Tribunal had found. I disagree. The Tribunal reasonably rejected this submission at paragraphs 299-300 of the Decision when it found that, as a surveyor and the individual with the governing perspective with respect to IR 80A, Mr. Nelson used the words in their geographic sense, not an administrative one.\n[85] The Applicants also suggest that the geographic bounds of the \u201cQu\u2019Appelle Valley\u201d were not clear. Again, the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of this, and its conclusion at paragraph 293 that Mr. Nelson and the Department regarded the Touchwood Hills, File Hills and Qu\u2019Appelle Valley as separate and distinct geographic locations, were grounded in the evidentiary record and are therefore reasonable. The Applicants have not demonstrated that this finding fundamentally misapprehends or fails to account for the evidence.\n[86] The Applicants further submit that the ambiguity is demonstrated by the fact that certain government officials and the Touchwood Hills Bands advocated a different interpretation of \u201cthe Touchwood Hills and Qu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u201d. In my view, the Tribunal reasonably rejected this submission at paragraph 304 when it found that the position taken by frontline officials did not amount to confusion on the part of the Department itself and the Department never altered its position on the correct interpretation.\n[87] In summary, the Applicants\u2019 submissions on whether there was a genuine ambiguity justifying the invocation of the principle of generous construction favourable to Indian interests have failed to demonstrate how the Tribunal \u201cmisapprehended or failed to account for the evidence before it.\u201d I conclude that the Applicants have not demonstrated that the Tribunal\u2019s finding on ambiguity is unreasonable.\n(3) Did the Tribunal unreasonably conclude that the interpretation of PC 1151 is determined by the Crown\u2019s intent? [88] The Applicants submit that the Tribunal unreasonably concluded that the interpretation of PC 1151 is determined by the Crown\u2019s intent alone. They submit that the Tribunal should have also taken Indigenous perspectives into account. Little Black Bear submits the two perspectives should be given equal weight.\n[89] The Tribunal\u2019s approach was based on general principles of statutory interpretation. At paragraph 139, the Tribunal stated:\n[139] Principles of statutory interpretation apply to orders in council (Osoyoos Indian Band v Oliver (Town), 2001 SCC 85, 2001 CarswellBC 2703 (WL Can). The general rule from Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd, (Re) 1998 CanLII 837 (SCC), [1998] 1 SCR 27, 1998 CarswellOnt 1 (WL Can), is that statutes must be interpreted in light of their purpose and context:\nToday there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament. [para 21; citing Elmer Driedger, Construction of Statutes, 2nd ed (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983) at 87]\n[90] In addition to these general principles, the Tribunal referred to reserve creation jurisprudence. While acknowledging that the reserve creation context is different, the Tribunal found that this jurisprudence provided guidance. According to the Tribunal, Crown intention is emphasized in these authorities. (Decision at paras. 131-135).\n[91] Through reliance on these principles, the Tribunal concluded that Crown intention should govern. This led the Tribunal to make an important finding that Indigenous perspectives cannot be taken into account unless the Crown\u2019s intent is somehow linked to these perspectives. For example, in considering evidence of pre-contact history, the Tribunal stated: \u201cIn this Claim, the Tribunal has been tasked with interpreting an order in council created by the Crown in furtherance of relationships established jointly between the Crown and the Claimants.\u201d (Decision at para. 158). As a result, although it is essential that pre-contact history be considered, it \u201cmisses the mark, unless it can be established that such pre-contact history was in the Crown\u2019s mind, or that the Crown\u2019s intent was somehow linked to that context.\u201d (Decision at para. 158). This conclusion is referenced many times in the Decision, sometimes being described as requiring a \u201cnexus\u201d between the two perspectives.\n[92] The Applicants submit that judicial authorities have accepted that Indigenous perspectives should be taken into account when interpreting an Order in Council, citing Anishnabe. However, Anishnabe is consistent with the approach taken by the Tribunal because Anishnabe considered Indigenous perspectives as part of the analysis to ultimately determine the intentions of the Crown (Decision at para. 169). The intention of the Crown was still the focal point of the analysis.\n[93] In Anishnabe, the Crown created a reserve \u201cnot to be for any particular Chief or Band, but for the Saulteaux Tribe, generally\u201d for the purpose of maintaining an Indian agency. In deciding for which of the Rainy River and Rainy Lake Bands the reserve was set apart pursuant to the Order in Council, the Court focused on determining the Crown\u2019s intention when establishing the reserve (Anishnabe at paras. 51, 54, 80, 83). In its determination of the Crown\u2019s intent, the judge considered the language of the Order in Council; evidence of the broader historical context, including the circumstances contemporaneous with or immediately following the Order in Council; and the conduct and actions of the parties following the date of a purported surrender of the reserve. The Court of Appeal for Ontario endorsed this approach to determining the Crown\u2019s intent (Anishnabe OCA at para. 27).\n[94] The Court in Anishnabe also considered Indigenous perspectives expressed in the oral evidence of Elders. However, it noted the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance in Mitchell v. M.N.R., 2001 SCC 33 at para. 30 [Mitchell], that oral tradition evidence \u201cmust be useful in the sense of tending to prove a fact relevant to the issues in the case\u201d and observed that oral evidence should be weighed against documentary evidence whose accuracy is established. The Court found that the oral evidence, \u201cwhile of some help, was vague and frequently not directly related to the issues before the court\u201d (Anishnabe at para. 58). Concluding that the historical record of events contemporaneous with the creation of the reserve was \u201cinconclusive, frequently vague and often conflicting,\u201d the Court held that the best evidence of the Crown\u2019s intention with respect to beneficial entitlement to the reserve were three \u201cunequivocal\u201d acts of surrender taken by Crown representatives and signed by the Rainy Lake Bands (Anishnabe at para. 83). This conclusion was upheld on appeal (Anishnabe OCA at para. 43).\n[95] The Tribunal\u2019s approach to determining the question of entitlement is entirely consistent with that adopted in Anishnabe. The Tribunal looked not only at the wording of PC 1151 but at the historical record in order to ascertain the Crown\u2019s intention regarding entitlement to IR 80A. Like the Court in Anishnabe, the Tribunal was open to considering the Indigenous perspectives expressed in the oral history evidence so long as these were relevant to the crucial question before it: which Bands did the Crown intend to benefit? As noted by the Tribunal, evidence regarding the Applicants\u2019 perspectives \u201cmight reveal that the Crown\u2019s intentions were informed by the Indigenous organization and collectivities of the time\u201d (Decision at para. 166). Accordingly, the Tribunal\u2019s search for a nexus between the oral history evidence and the Crown\u2019s intention in creating IR 80A was consistent with Anishnabe.\n[96] Finally, Little Black Bear relies on certain judicial decisions which gave significant weight to Indigenous perspectives as adduced through oral history evidence. However, this jurisprudence involved a much different context. For example, in Kwicksutaineuk\/Ah-Kwa-Mish First Nation v. British Columbia (Agriculture & Lands), 2010 BCSC 1699, the Court sought to decide how to determine the members of a class of Indigenous plaintiffs who could claim an Aboriginal right to fish by virtue of their ancestral connection to an identifiable collective which engaged in that practice in pre-contact times. The Tribunal decided that this jurisprudence did not support Little Black Bear\u2019s claim that \u201cQu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u201d should be interpreted consistently with pre-contact collectives that existed on the Prairies, because it did not involve the interpretation of an Order in Council created by the Crown (Decision at para. 158). In my view, Little Black Bear has not shown that this conclusion is unreasonable.\n[97] Accordingly, I conclude that the Applicants have not demonstrated the Tribunal acted unreasonably in determining that Crown intent governs the interpretation of PC 1151 and that Indigenous perspectives do not assist this inquiry unless the evidence establishes a nexus between the two perspectives.\n(4) Was the Tribunal\u2019s approach to the oral history evidence unreasonable? [98] The Applicants submit that the Tribunal took an overly-restrictive approach to the oral history evidence.\n[99] Little Black Bear submits that the Tribunal erred in rejecting its testimony that IR 80A was set aside for Little Black Bear alone. It refers to a decision of the Ontario Superior Court which stated: \u201cEven if oral history is not definitive or precise, it may be useful \u2026\u201d (Saugeen First Nation v. Canada, 2021 ONSC 4181, at para. 47).\n[100] In essence, Little Black Bear appears to suggest that the Tribunal should have found that the Crown made it some sort of promise, short of it being solely entitled to IR 80A. However, the trouble with this submission is that reasonableness review requires that deference be given to the factual findings of the Tribunal. In this case, Little Black Bear has not established that the Tribunal fundamentally misapprehended or failed to consider evidence. It would not be in accordance with reasonableness review for this Court to reassess this evidence.\n[101] Star Blanket also submits that the Tribunal\u2019s approach to the oral history evidence was too restrictive. It submits that the Tribunal should not have required specific evidence of a nexus between Indigenous and Crown perspectives and should not have required more complete evidence of an oral promise of a fishing station at the time of the treaty. Star Blanket refers to Mitchell, where at paragraph 34 the Supreme Court cautions against rejecting oral histories simply because the testimony lacks precise detail.\n[102] The excerpt from Mitchell cited by Star Blanket was referred to by the Tribunal at paragraph 152. However, in the same paragraph the Tribunal also referred to another excerpt from Mitchell which adds a caveat to the statement referred to by Star Blanket. The caveat is at paragraph 39 of Mitchell:\n[39] There is a boundary that must not be crossed between a sensitive application and a complete abandonment of the rules of evidence. As Binnie J. observed in the context of treaty rights, \u201c[g]enerous rules of interpretation should not be confused with a vague sense of after-the-fact largesse\u201d (Marshall v. Canada, 1999 CanLII 665 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 456 (S.C.C.), at para. 14). . . . Claims must still be established on the basis of persuasive evidence demonstrating their validity on the balance of probabilities.\n[103] As further noted by the Supreme Court in Mitchell at paragraph 30, \u201cthe evidence must be useful in the sense of tending to prove a fact relevant to the issues in the case.\u201d\n[104] Star Blanket\u2019s submission failed to note the Supreme Court\u2019s caveat in Mitchell. Rules of evidence are not to be abandoned, and \u201cpersuasive evidence\u201d is required.\n[105] For the reasons I have previously explained, it was reasonable for the Tribunal to find that the central issue before it was the Crown\u2019s intention with regards to who would be entitled to the benefit of IR 80A. Accordingly, it reasonably required a \u201cnexus\u201d between Indigenous and Crown perspectives.\n[106] The Tribunal found that the Applicants had adduced no evidence that Mr. Nelson was made aware of the Applicants\u2019 perspectives, including their self-identification as Indians of the Qu\u2019Appelle Valley, or of the importance of Kinookimaw to their community. It found no evidence that the File Hills Bands had communicated their need for a fishing station to Mr. Nelson in such a manner that it could be inferred that he intended to include them as \u201cQu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u201d entitled to IR 80A (Decision at paras. 301, 317-322). In such circumstances, it was open to the Tribunal to come to the conclusion, on the basis of the documentary evidence before it, including the Department\u2019s Annual Reports and Mr. Nelson\u2019s Chronicles and notes, that \u201cQu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u201d included those Bands located within the Qu\u2019Appelle Valley, a geographic location distinct from the Touchwood Hills or File Hills.\n(5) Did the Tribunal misunderstand the evidence? [107] The Applicants also submit that the Tribunal failed to properly account for some of the evidence before it. Below, I discuss two instances that are illustrative of this line of argument.\n[108] First, the Applicants submit that the Tribunal erred when it stated that there was nothing in the record to suggest the File Hills Bands did not have the ability to fish (Decision at para. 321). The Applicants submit that this fails to take into account that there is a reasonable explanation for their failure to raise a concern about having an ability to fish. The explanation they suggest is that the File Hills Bands thought they had the right to fish at IR 80A.\n[109] This submission implies that the Tribunal inferred that the File Hills Bands had access to fishing and therefore did not need to be beneficiaries of IR 80A. But the Tribunal made no such finding. Instead, the Tribunal appeared to focus on the state of the record so that it could assess whether Mr. Nelson was made aware of the File Hills Bands\u2019 needs for fishing. This was ultimately relevant to determining whether there was a nexus with the Crown\u2019s intent. In my view, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion with respect to the evidence as to the File Hills Bands\u2019 access to fishing is not unreasonable.\n[110] Another alleged error, raised by Star Blanket, concerns the Tribunal\u2019s finding that Star Blanket\u2019s Elders gave inconsistent evidence. Star Blanket submits this misunderstands the Elder evidence.\n[111] The Tribunal took into account the evidence of three Star Blanket Elders. One of them was Elder Margaret Starblanket. According to the Tribunal, this Elder did not support the evidence of the other two Elders. The Tribunal noted that Elder Starblanket testified IR 80A \u201cwas a place for people who needed a place to fish, including members of Little Black Bear, George Gordon, Muscowpetung, and Peepeekisis, although she understood it to have been a part of Little Black Bear\u2019s lands\u201d (Decision at para. 245).\n[112] The Tribunal was correct that Elder Margaret Starblanket\u2019s evidence was not consistent with Star Blanket\u2019s other witnesses. However, there is a reasonable explanation for this and it appears that the Tribunal did not take this into account. Elder Margaret Starblanket grew up on Little Black Bear\u2019s reserve, but married a Star Blanket Chief and lived on the Star Blanket reserve after that. She testified that she was told about Kinookimaw by her father. (Decision at paras. 235, 104).\n[113] Therefore, it appears that Elder Margaret Starblanket was testifying about the oral history of Little Black Bear, not Star Blanket. Accordingly, I agree with Star Blanket that the Tribunal did not have a satisfactory explanation for finding that Star Blanket\u2019s oral history evidence was inconsistent.\n[114] The remaining question is whether this shortcoming is significant enough to taint the reasonableness of the Decision. In my view, it is not, because the Tribunal relied more heavily on other reasons for ultimately rejecting Star Blanket\u2019s oral history evidence.\n[115] In particular, the Tribunal focussed mainly on the testimony of life speaker Noel Starblanket. According to the Tribunal, life speaker Starblanket testified that Star Blanket was originally given fishing rights at another location and \u201cthe rights shifted to Kinookimaw although he did not explain how\u201d (Decision at para. 245).\n[116] Life speaker Noel Starblanket was not the only witness who testified to an oral promise of fishing rights which was part of Treaty 4 or related to it. Other Claimants\u2019 witnesses did the same. The Tribunal considered this evidence collectively and found it to be particularly problematic. The Tribunal stated that the testimony \u201ccame with little elaboration or underlying factual basis\u201d\u2014and \u201c[w]ithout more, I am skeptical.\u201d (Decision at para. 252). This comment includes life speaker Starblanket\u2019s evidence as described above.\n[117] The Tribunal also raised other shortcomings with the witnesses\u2019 testimony concerning an oral promise of fishing rights. It concluded that, if an oral promise had been made, the evidence would have been stronger and the Crown would have likely had a record of it (Decision at para. 245). The Tribunal also observed that the concept of fishing stations had not been developed when Treaty 4 was signed. At that time, \u201cno reserves were yet in existence and settlement was in its infancy. \u2026 [T]hey could fish anywhere in this vast territory, except as limited by Treaty.\u201d Fishing stations were not developed until 1881. (Decision at paras. 28, 256).\n[118] Accordingly, the Tribunal provided many reasons for rejecting Star Blanket\u2019s oral history evidence. The Applicants have not shown that, when the reasons are read holistically, the apparent flaw concerning inconsistencies stemming from the evidence of Elder Margaret Starblanket is \u201csufficiently central or significant to render the decision unreasonable\u201d (Vavilov at para. 100).\n[119] In any event, the Tribunal considered the evidence of the Applicants for its ultimate ability to demonstrate a nexus with Crown intent in creating IR 80A. In the end, the outcome rested on a finding that there was no such nexus between the Indigenous and Crown perspectives (Decision at para. 318).\n[120] Therefore, the shortcomings raised by the Applicants with respect to the Tribunal\u2019s evaluation of their oral history evidence does not make the Decision unreasonable.\n(6) Did the Tribunal misunderstand the Agreed Issues? [121] The parties agreed that there were two issues to be determined in the standing sub-phase: (1) For the benefit of which Claimants was IR 80A set aside and confirmed? and, (2) Which Claimants made use of IR 80A? (Decision at para. 17). Star Blanket submits that the Tribunal erred by not correctly applying the second agreed issue concerning the use of IR 80A.\n[122] The Tribunal determined that all of the Claimants made use of IR 80A. Star Blanket does not take issue with this, but submits that the parties agreed that use by a Claimant would be sufficient to establish that it was a beneficiary. For clarity, Star Blanket did not explain why use would be sufficient as a matter of law, a proposition flatly rejected by the Tribunal (Decision at para. 311). Star Blanket\u2019s argument was simply that the parties agreed to it.\n[123] There is no merit to this submission. I first note that Star Blanket provided no support for its position that there was such an agreement. I also observe that Star Blanket\u2019s position appears to be inconsistent with the position it took before the Tribunal. At paragraph 182 of the Decision, the Tribunal comments that the Applicants submitted that \u201cthe requirements of Ross River [reserve creation] were complete when they used IR 80A.\u201d [Emphasis added]. There is a material difference between completing requirements and there being only one requirement, as Star Blanket now submits.\n[124] Accordingly, Star Blanket has not demonstrated that the Tribunal failed to correctly apply the agreed issues.\n(7) Did the Tribunal err at paragraph 148 of the Decision? [125] Little Black Bear submits that the Tribunal erred when it stated in its overview of the law that \u201cprinciples of treaty interpretation and the honour of the Crown \u2026 have less useful application where, as here, the Indigenous beneficiaries of a Crown promise have conflicting perspectives and interests in the subject of the promise\u201d (Decision at para. 148).\n[126] Even assuming that the Tribunal\u2019s statement at paragraph 148 is flawed, the flaw is not sufficiently central or significant to render the Tribunal\u2019s decision unreasonable (Vavilov at para. 100). That is because the Tribunal did not rely on this statement to justify its analysis and conclusion regarding the interpretation of PC 1151. That the statement was obiter is made clear in the Tribunal\u2019s concluding comment at paragraph 318. There, the Tribunal states that \u201c[n]one of the principles of interpretation, applied liberally and to the best advantage of the File Hills Bands, can expand Mr. Nelson\u2019s intent. \u2026 I cannot import or expand an intent that Mr. Nelson did not have when the evidence indicates otherwise\u201d [emphasis added]. The state of the evidence led the Tribunal to conclude that these principles were inapplicable. Accordingly, whether the Claimants and beneficiaries had \u201cconflicting interests and perspectives in the subject of the promise\u201d was of no moment to the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of PC 1151.\n(8) Did the Tribunal fail to apply principles stemming from the honour of the Crown? [127] Little Black Bear submits that given the connection between IR 80A and the treaty promise of fishing rights, a purposive, honourable interpretation of PC 1151 should have included Little Black Bear, a landlocked Band, within IR 80A\u2019s beneficiary class so as to grant them access to fishing.\n[128] As noted by Little Black Bear, the Tribunal acknowledged that \u201c[f]ishing stations were a mechanism through which both the Crown and Indigenous treaty adherents\u2019 concerns about fishing access could be addressed.\u201d (Decision at para. 257). While this general statement is clearly supported by the record, the question remains as to whether the Crown intended Little Black Bear to be a beneficiary of IR 80A.\n[129] Little Black Bear asserts that the Tribunal acknowledged the government\u2019s intent to include it as a beneficiary. Little Black Bear referred to the following excerpt at paragraph 180 of the Decision: \u201cBy creating the fishing station, the Government facilitated settlement, maintained the peace and met its obligations under Treaty 4. Landlocked bands, including the File Hills Bands, would be assured of fishing grounds and access to them.\u201d\n[130] I disagree with Little Black Bear that this excerpt is such an acknowledgement. When paragraph 180 is read in context of the surrounding text, it is very clear that the Tribunal was simply summarizing the submissions of the File Hills Bands. These submissions were ultimately rejected by the Tribunal. In fact, the excerpt goes against the central conclusion of the Tribunal, which is that the Crown did not intend to include the File Hills Bands as beneficiaries of IR 80A.\n[131] As for the merits of Little Black Bear\u2019s argument that an honourable interpretation of PC 1151 should have included it as a beneficiary of IR 80A, the Tribunal addressed this at paragraphs 252 and 320 of the Decision. As discussed at paragraph 48 above, the Tribunal concluded that there was insufficient evidence \u201cto support a finding that a promise of fishing station reserves was made at the time of Treaty adherence, either as part of the Treaty or in some related way\u201d (Decision at para. 252). Little Black Bear has not convinced me that this conclusion is unreasonable.\n[132] Little Black Bear also submits that the Tribunal was obliged to consider its longstanding traditional use of IR 80A. It cites Manitoba Metis, at paragraph 66, where the Supreme Court states that \u201cthe \u2018ultimate purpose\u2019 of the honour of the Crown is reconciliation.\u201d Little Black Bear suggests that reconciliation should be achieved \u201cby interpreting PC 1151 generously and with a view to fulfilling the treaty promise of fishing.\u201d\n[133] The Tribunal was aware of the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence on honour of the Crown principles (Decision at paras. 145-147). These principles include the comments from Manitoba Metis at paragraphs 77-78 that \u201cthe honour of the Crown demands that constitutional obligations to Aboriginal peoples be given a broad, purposive interpretation,\u201d and the \u201chonour of the Crown requires it to act diligently in pursuit of its solemn obligations and the honourable reconciliation of Crown and Aboriginal interests.\u201d However, as stated above the Tribunal concluded that these principles cannot be applied to require it to \u201cimport or expand\u201d the Crown\u2019s intent with respect to IR 80A \u201cwhen the evidence indicates otherwise\u201d (Decision at para. 318).\n[134] The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is supported by two recent appellate level decisions involving the interpretation of treaties.\n[135] In one, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia stated that the honour of the Crown is not to be used to alter promises made by the Crown: \u201cThe honour of the Crown is not applied to rewrite history. It should not be used to retroactively alter the promises the Crown actually made to Indigenous peoples to make these promises more honourable.\u201d (West Moberly First Nations v. British Columbia, 2020 BCCA 138 at para. 416, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 39292 (21 January 2021)).\n[136] The second case is a recent decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. In Fletcher v. Ontario, 2024 ONCA 148 at para. 125 [Fletcher], the Court noted with approval the following comment made by the trial judge: \u201c[I]t is not the role of treaty interpretation to distort the meaning of the treaty in an attempt to redress an historical wrong.\u201d The appellate Court concluded that this statement was consistent with the jurisprudence that \u201cgenerous rules of interpretation should not be confused with a vague sense of after-the-fact largesse\u201d (citing Marshall v. Canada, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 456, at para. 14 [Marshall]).\n[137] As for Little Black Bear\u2019s submission that there is a connection between IR 80A and a treaty promise of fishing rights, the Tribunal recognized this connection, but commented that it consisted of a very general \u201cpromise of access to unsettled, undeveloped land for fishing.\u201d It noted further that \u201cthere was nothing to indicate that the device of fishing stations had been conceived of at the time of the signing of the Treaty.\u201d Ultimately, the Tribunal did not accept that a right to a fishing station could be inferred from the Treaty. (Decision at para. 320). The Applicants have not convinced me that this conclusion is unreasonable.\n[138] If Little Black Bear\u2019s suggested approach to honour of the Crown principles were accepted, it would require the Tribunal to adopt a meaning of \u201cthe Touchwood Hills and Qu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u201d in PC 1151 that the Tribunal concluded its words, context and purpose cannot reasonably bear. The Tribunal reasonably rejected this approach. To use the words of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Fletcher at paragraph 125, the honour of the Crown \u201ccannot alter the terms of the treaty [or Order in Council] by exceeding what \u2018is possible on the language\u2019 or realistic\u201d (citing Marshall at paras. 14 and 78). In essence, this is what Little Black Bear\u2019s submission attempts to do.\n(9) Conclusion [139] These reasons address the central submissions of the Applicants. Ultimately, I conclude that the Applicants have not met their burden to demonstrate that the Decision is unreasonable.\nVI. Disposition [140] I would dismiss these applications for judicial review.\n[141] With respect to costs, Standing Buffalo requested an opportunity to make written submissions on costs following the release of this decision. Accordingly, I would permit the Respondents to make submissions (each not to exceed eight pages in length, excluding supporting documentation) within 15 days from the date hereof. The Applicants may make submissions on costs (again, each not to exceed eight pages in length, excluding supporting documentation) within 15 days after service of the Respondents\u2019 submissions. The Respondents may make submissions in reply (each not to exceed four pages in length) within 10 days after service of the Applicants\u2019 submissions.\n\u201cJudith Woods\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nGerald Heckman J.A.\u201d\nGLEASON J.A. (Dissenting Reasons)\n[142] I have had the opportunity of reading the majority reasons and regret that I cannot agree that the Specific Claims Tribunal\u2019s decision is reasonable.\n[143] The majority takes the position that nothing turns on the Tribunal\u2019s finding at paragraph 148 of the Decision that principles of treaty interpretation and the honour of the Crown related to the interpretation of PC 1151 \u201chave less useful application where \u2026 the Indigenous beneficiaries of a Crown promise have conflicting perspectives and interests in the subject of the promise\u201d. I disagree. In my view, the Tribunal\u2019s minimization of these principles tainted its approach to statutory interpretation and very possibly skewed its interpretation of PC 1151. Given this, these findings cannot be characterized as merely non-binding obiter or an unfortunate comment. Rather, in my view, they constitute a fundamental flaw in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning that renders the Decision unreasonable.\n[144] The comments in question appear at the end of the Tribunal\u2019s discussion of the principles of statutory interpretation applicable to PC 1151 and represent its conclusion on these issues. As the majority notes, the Tribunal cited from the case law regarding the honour of the Crown and the principles applicable to interpreting provisions in enactments relating to Indigenous people, but at the end of that discussion, concluded that these principles are of limited application to situations where two or more Indigenous beneficiaries have competing interests and perspectives. In my view, this conclusion is unsustainable in light of the governing case law.\n[145] It is trite law that the principle of the honour of the Crown is \u201calways at stake\u201d in circumstances where it is engaged: R. v. Badger, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 771, [1996] S.C.J. No. 39 at para. 41 [Badger]; R. v. Marshall, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 456, [1999] S.C.J. No. 55 at paras. 49, 51; Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests), 2004 SCC 73, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511 at para. 16 [Haida Nation], Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 623 at para. 74 [Manitoba Metis]. As Chief Justice McLachlin stressed in Haida Nation, the honour of the Crown \u201cis not a mere incantation, but rather a core precept that finds its application in concrete practices\u201d: at para. 16.\n[146] The duties that flow from the honour of the Crown vary according to the circumstances in which they arise: Newfoundland and Labrador (Attorney General) v. Uashaunnuat (Innu of Uashat and of Mani\u2011Utenam), 2020 SCC 4, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 15 at para. 22; Manitoba Metis at para. 74; Haida Nation at para. 27.\n[147] One such circumstance involves the interpretation of statutes or other enactments that directly impact Indigenous people and their interests in reserve lands. Since the honour of the Crown speaks to how Crown obligations and duties to Indigenous people must be fulfilled, the interpretation of statutes that have an impact upon treaty or aboriginal rights must be approached \u201cin a manner that maintains the integrity of the Crown\u201d: Badger at para. 41; Manitoba Metis at para. 68.\n[148] According to the jurisprudence, this means that legislation directly relating to the interest of Indigenous people in lands set aside as reserves should receive a large, liberal, and purposive interpretation and that any \u201cdoubtful expression\u201d, where a true ambiguity exists, is to be resolved in favour of Indigenous interests, provided the interpretation favouring Indigenous interests is one that the enactment can reasonably bear: Osoyoos Indian Band v. Oliver (Town), 2001 SCC 85, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 746 at paras. 124\u2013125 [Osoyoos]; Mitchell v. Peguis Indian Band, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 85, [1990] S.C.J. No. 63 at 98-99, 107\u2013108, 117, 143 [Mitchell]; Nowegijick v. The Queen, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 29, [1983] S.C.J. No. 5 at 36 [Nowegijick].\n[149] These principles are just as applicable in a case involving multiple Indigenous communities with conflicting perspectives and interests on the interpretation of a federal statute or Order in Council as they would be where an Indigenous community is pitted directly against the Crown. This is because what is at issue in both types of cases is the interpretation of an enactment governing reserve lands. The principles regarding the interpretation of enactments directly relating to the interest of Indigenous people in lands set aside as reserves and resolution of ambiguities in such enactments in favour of Indigenous people were developed, in large part, to further reconciliation subsequent to the Crown\u2019s assertion of sovereignty over Indigenous peoples and its assumption of de facto control of the lands and resources that were formerly in the control of those peoples: Manitoba Metis at para. 66; Haida Nation at para. 32. Given this, there can be no doubt that the honour of the Crown, and the related interpretive principle of resolving true ambiguities in favour of Indigenous people, apply to the interpretation of enactments that directly affect an Indigenous community\u2019s interest in reserve lands, as is the case here, whether there are conflicting Indigenous perspectives or not.\n[150] Where there are competing Indigenous interests, I agree with one of the applicants, Star Blanket First Nation, that the interpretation that minimally impairs all of the Indigenous interests at stake must be adopted to resolve true ambiguities. Here, a resolution in favour of the applicants would at worst minimally impair the interests of the Indigenous respondents, who might have to share an eventual damages award, if one were made, with two additional First Nation communities. On the other hand, the Tribunal\u2019s adverse finding against the applicants completely disentitles them. Thus, the interpretive principle of resolving ambiguity in favour of Indigenous people would favour recognizing the applicants as being among the intended beneficiaries of IR 80A in the event there is a true ambiguity in PC 1151.\n[151] I appreciate that, in some instances, an administrative tribunal, whose decisions are to be accorded deference under the reasonableness standard of review, need not necessarily apply principles from case law in the same way a court would: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653 at para. 113 [Vavilov]; Nor-Man Regional Health Authority Inc. v. Manitoba Association of Health Care Professionals, 2011 SCC 59, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 616 at paras. 5\u20136, 44\u201345, and 60. However, to be reasonable, a decision must be justified in relation to the constellation of law surrounding that decision: Vavilov at para. 105. This includes relevant statutory or common law, the principles of statutory interpretation, as well as any case law precedents on the issue: Vavilov at paras. 106 and 111-112. Indeed, where there is relevant jurisprudence in which a court considered a statutory provision, it is generally unreasonable for an administrative decision maker to interpret or apply the provision without regard to those precedents: Vavilov at para. 112. According to Vavilov, such a departure would only be appropriate if \u201ca decision maker [is] able to explain why a different interpretation is preferable by, for example, explaining why the court\u2019s interpretation does not work in the administrative context\u201d: at para. 112; Canada (Attorney General) v. Poupart, 2022 FCA 77, 2022 CarswellNat 1371 at para. 49; Burlacu v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 10, 2022 CarswellNat 60 at para. 54.\n[152] The majority finds that the Tribunal\u2019s minimization of the fundamental principles applicable to interpreting enactments like PC 1151 is not determinative because the Tribunal in any event determined that the context resolved the ambiguities in PC 1151 in a fashion that was reasonable. The majority also finds that it was reasonable for the Tribunal to conclude that interpreting the phrase \u201cTouchwood Hills and Qu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u201d as including the applicant communities was not an interpretation that PC 1151 could reasonably bear.\n[153] With respect, I disagree. Since the Tribunal completely discounted the need to apply the interpretive principle of resolving ambiguity in favour of Indigenous people, I have no confidence that it adequately considered whether a true ambiguity exists in PC 1151. Further, the context relied upon by the Tribunal is largely limited to the documents of one Crown surveyor and does not consider the other pertinent contextual factors surrounding the executive\u2019s promulgation of PC 1151: Decision at para. 305. The Tribunal also ignored the ambiguous nature of the text and the purpose of PC 1151.\n[154] Among the matters glossed over by the Tribunal in finding no ambiguity in PC 1151, I start with the important fact that, as concerns the issues at play in this application, the text of PC 1151 is clearly facially ambiguous, a proposition that is not disputed. It is impossible from the text of PC 1151 to determine the intended beneficiaries of IR 80A since it is impossible to ascertain from the text of the Order in Council creating IR 80A what is meant by the \u201cTouchwood Hills and Qu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u201d for whose benefit the fishing station was set aside.\n[155] Secondly, the Tribunal glossed over and gave little importance to the purpose for which fishing stations, including IR 80A, were created by the Crown. The historical record demonstrates that such stations were created to provide fishing access for Indigenous people when settlers were rapidly moving into the region and taking up lands, including along the shores of many lakes suitable for fishing. Treaty No. 4 promised its signatories, which included the applicants, fishing rights \u201c\u2026throughout the tract surrendered, subject to such regulations as may from time to time be made by the government of the country, acting under the authority of Her Majesty, and saving and excepting such tracts as may be required or taken up from time to time for settlement\u2026\u201d. The reserves of the applicants (and of two other adjacent First Nations who did not appear before the Court) were landlocked, with no border on a river. The Tribunal gave no weight to these considerations in its interpretation of PC 1151, despite recognizing that reserve creation under PC 1151 was part of the implementation of Treaty No. 4: Decision at para. 252.\n[156] Thirdly, many contextual factors were ignored by the Tribunal in its statutory interpretation analysis when it chose to rely almost exclusively on documents from Surveyor Nelson to ascertain the Crown\u2019s intent: Decision at paras. 301, 315. These include the fact that all of the communities involved in this application for judicial review had strong cultural and socio-economic ties to the IR 80A. The record before the Tribunal highlighted that, since time immemorial, the applicants visited, fished, and gathered at Kinookimaw: Decision at para. 96. It is clear that they regarded Kinookimaw as a sacred place. Indeed, Chiefs of two File Hills Bands \u201chad both died and been buried\u201d there before the reserve was created: Decision at paras. 98\u201399. The evidence also suggested that others from these Bands were buried there as well: Decision at para. 98. Further, all of the Indigenous groups implicated in these proceedings, both applicants and respondents, considered themselves to be people of the Qu\u2019Appelle Valley. Before reserve creation, they all lived a nomadic life over the same lands in what is now southern Saskatchewan and followed a migratory route through the entire Qu\u2019Appelle Valley region: Decision at paras. 19, 84-87. In addition, until 1885, the year after Surveyor Nelson visited Last Mountain Lake to begin to survey what was to become IR 80A, the provisional reserves of the applicants were administered by the Qu\u2019Appelle Agency of the Department of Indian Affairs and later returned to be administered by that Agency: Decision at paras. 178, 298.\n[157] One assumes that at least some of the foregoing surrounding facts would have been known to Crown officials and\/or the federal cabinet when PC 1151 was promulgated. In any event, there appears to be no evidence to support a conclusion that Crown officials did not know about the applicants\u2019 affiliation to the area and their need for a fishing station.\n[158] Fourthly, contemporaneous notes of Surveyor Nelson, made in 1883 to outline his plan of survey for the following year, show that he identified that the applicants\u2019 reserves, those in the Touchwood Hills, and a fishing station on Last Mountain Lake as all being in the Qu\u2019Appelle District. This is not far from the wording that appears in PC 1151 of \u201cQu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u201d.\n[159] Fifthly, post-reserve creation, members of the applicant First Nations continued to visit and fish at IR 80A, without complaint from the respondent First Nations or the Crown. In addition, evidence in the record indicates that at least one Crown official in the Department of Indian Affairs, the Indian Commissioner, shared the applicants\u2019 view that they were among the \u201cQu\u2019Appelle Valley Indians\u201d: Decision at para. 70.\n[160] Had the Tribunal correctly understood that it was to apply the interpretive principles introduced in Nowegijick, and refined later in Mitchell and Osoyoos, it may well have given greater weight to the foregoing considerations, determined that a true ambiguity exists in PC 1151, and resolved this ambiguity in favour of the applicants. Without a purposive and contextual analysis of PC 1151, consistent with the aforementioned interpretive principles, I cannot accept that the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is reasonable. In effect, the Tribunal\u2019s approach relegates the interpretive principles to being no more than a tool of last resort. As Ruth Sullivan compellingly argues in The Construction of Statutes, 7th ed (Lexis Nexis, 2022) at \u00a7 20.01:\nThe Indigenous entitlement to social justice follows from the need to uphold the honour of the Crown in its dealings with Indigenous peoples. Seen from this perspective, the liberal construction of legislation relating to Indigenous peoples is in part an attempt to remedy injustice resulting from the Crown\u2019s past failures to live up to its commitments and to discharge its fiduciary responsibilities. From this perspective, there is no justification for treating it as a presumption of last resort.\n[161] I therefore conclude that the Decision is unreasonable.\n[162] The applicants urged this Court to decide this application and not remit it to the Tribunal given the passage of time since the date of the Decision and the subsequent retirement of the Chairperson of the Tribunal who authored the Decision. I would decline this invitation.\n[163] It is exceptional for a court to render a decision in a judicial review application as opposed to remitting the matter back to the administrative decision maker for redetermination in accordance with the court\u2019s reasons. As the majority noted in Vavilov, at paragraph 140, \u201c\u2026the choice of remedy must be guided by the rationale for applying [the reasonableness standard of review] to begin with, including the recognition by the reviewing court that the legislature has entrusted the matter to the administrative decision maker, and not to the court, to decide\u201d.\n[164] While a court possesses the discretion to not remit a dispute to an administrative decision maker, it will usually be appropriate to do so only if a particular outcome is inevitable or where there are circumstances that make it inappropriate to do so. As the majority noted at paragraph 142 in Vavilov:\nElements like concern for delay, fairness to the parties, urgency of providing a resolution to the dispute, the nature of the particular regulatory regime, whether the administrative decision maker had a genuine opportunity to weigh in on the issue in question, costs to the parties, and the efficient use of public resources may also influence the exercise of a court\u2019s discretion to remit a matter, just as they may influence the exercise of its discretion to quash a decision that is flawed:\n[165] Here, it cannot be said that a single result is inevitable. Of the foregoing discretionary factors mentioned in paragraph 142 of Vavilov, the only one present is delay. Yet much of the delay in question was occasioned by the parties, who, on consent, requested multiple adjournments of this application to explore settlement possibilities, until the matter was eventually scheduled for hearing when some of the respondents withdrew their consent. Given this, the delay does not warrant the Court stepping in and deciding the case.\n[166] For these reasons, I would grant the application for judicial review, with costs, and would remit this matter to the Specific Claims Tribunal for redetermination in accordance with these reasons.\n\u201cMary J.L.

Background\n[1] The Attorney General of Canada seeks judicial review of a decision (2022 CIRB 1051) made on November 30, 2022, by the Canada Industrial Relations Board pursuant to section 251.12 of the Canada Labour Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2 (Code). Under the terms of this decision, the Board accepts, in part, because it is time-barred, Mr. Monette\u2019s request for review of a payment order issued on March 16, 2021, by an inspector of the Labour Program at Employment and Social Development Canada.\n[2] Mr. Monette is one of two former directors of D\u00e9m\u00e9nagement Montr\u00e9al Express Inc. On September 23, 2015, the corporation, which is incorporated under Quebec\u2019s Business Corporations Act, CQLR, c. S-31.1 (BCA), made an assignment under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3.\n[3] On October 2, 2015, a former employee of the corporation filed a complaint against it for unpaid wages and non-payment of vacation pay. The Labour Program inspector then conducted an inspection to see whether all the corporation\u2019s employees received the wages and amounts to which they are entitled.\n[4] On September 13, 2018, following her investigation and relying on section 251.18 of the Code, the inspector forwarded to the other director a Preliminary Letter of Determination stating that he is responsible for paying $100,036.93 for unpaid wages and amounts to 38 employees.\n[5] Since the other director had made a bankruptcy proposal to his creditors, the inspector forwarded the Preliminary Letter of Determination to Mr. Monette. The record does not show when it was forwarded to him.\n[6] On December 5, 2018, the Inspector sent Mr. Monette a revised Letter of Determination. She then held him responsible for paying $334,259.01 to 132 employees. The inspector then changed the amounts claimed on September 22, 2020 ($137,212.10 for 139 employees), February 3, 2021 ($92,354.71 for 130 employees), and February 17, 2021 ($87,415.95 for 128 employees). On March 16, 2021, she issued Mr. Monette a formal payment order pursuant to subsection 251.1(1) and section 251.18 of the Code, ordering him to pay $87,415.95 for unpaid wages and amounts.\n[7] Dissatisfied, Mr. Monette disputed the payment order. In his request for review, he raised several grounds, including the more than three years from the time the corporation made an assignment on September 16, 2015, to the first notice claiming money from him under the Code on December 5, 2018. He submits that under subsection 251.01(2) of the Code, an employee has six months from the day on which the wages should have been paid to make a complaint against their employer. As a result, the complaints should have been filed by March 16, 2016, given the corporation\u2019s bankruptcy. He adds that despite a request to do so, he never received a copy of the complaints that led to the investigation and the Inspector\u2019s mandate. He also criticizes the inspector for not attempting to reconcile the parties under section 251.03 of the Code. His request for review was forwarded to the Board to be treated as an appeal, pursuant to subsection 251.101(7) of the Code.\n[8] On November 30, 2022, the Board allowed in part the request for review. It amended the payment order and removed from the list of former employees all employees who had not filed a proof of claim with the trustee following the corporation\u2019s bankruptcy.\n[9] In a section of its analysis entitled [translation] \u201cLimitation Period,\u201d the Board first notes that the time between the corporation\u2019s bankruptcy and the inspector\u2019s first claim may seem long, but that [translation] \u201cHowever, it remains to be seen whether this time limit causes the payment order to be rescinded because it is time-barred\u201d (para. 50). Second, it noted that the two conditions set out in section 251.18 of the Code are met, because it is not disputed that Mr. Monette was the director of the corporation at the time the debt arose and that recovery of the debt from the corporation was impossible or unlikely.\n[10] The Board went on to point out that section 251.18 of the Code does not provide for a time limit to submit a claim to a director for unpaid wages, contrary to section 154 of the BCA. This Act provides that directors are jointly liable only if the corporation, within one year after the debt becomes due, becomes bankrupt within the meaning of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and that a claim for that debt is filed with the trustee. On the basis of a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in In the Matter of Western Express Air Lines Inc., 2006 BCSC 1267 (Western Express), the Board concludes that the claims of former employees who have not filed a proof of claim to the trustee are statute barred under section 154 of the BCA, and that as a result, Mr. Monette owes no money to them.\n[11] Before this Court, the Attorney General of Canada submits that section 154 of the BCA does not impose a limitation period but a precondition for the imputation of liability to the director under section 154 of the BCA. The Board could not, on the pretext of the absence of a limitation period provided for in the Code, rely on the suppletive law of Quebec and add to the conditions set out in section 251.18 of the Code by imposing a prior obligation to file a proof of claim with the trustee.\n[12] The Attorney General also contends that the interpretation exercise carried out by the Board is inconsistent with the modern principle of legislative interpretation, which focuses on the text, context, and purpose of the legislative provision. In this regard, he criticizes the Board for considering Western Express a binding precedent without having conducted an analysis of the legislative provisions at issue and adds that the Board failed to consider the purpose of the Code, which is intended to be a comprehensive plan, and the restrictions imposed by its section 168. Finally, he argues that in the presence of divergent authority on the statute-barred issue, the Board had to justify its findings. This is all the more true because the applicability of section 154 of the BCA had not been raised by either party.\n[13] Mr. Monette did not file a memorandum in the case at hand or appear at the hearing of this application for judicial review. The application will therefore be determined on the basis of the Attorney General of Canada\u2019s written and oral submissions and the application record, which includes Mr. Monette\u2019s response to the Inspector and his request for review submitted to the Board.\nII. Analysis\n[14] As the application for judicial review raises the Board\u2019s interpretation and application of section 251.18 of the Code, the presumptive standard of review is reasonableness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at para. 115).\n[15] In my view, the application for judicial review should be allowed.\n[16] For ease of reference, it is useful to reproduce the main legislative provisions at issue.\n[17] Section 251.18 of the Code reads as follows:\n251.18 Directors of a corporation are jointly and severally liable for wages and other amounts to which an employee is entitled under this Part, to a maximum amount equivalent to six months\u2019 wages, to the extent that\n(a) the entitlement arose during the particular director\u2019s incumbency; and\n(b) recovery of the amount from the corporation is impossible or unlikely.\n251.18 Les administrateurs d\u2019une personne morale sont, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence d\u2019une somme \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 six mois de salaire, solidairement responsables du salaire et des autres indemnit\u00e9s auxquels l\u2019employ\u00e9 a droit sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente partie, dans la mesure o\u00f9 la cr\u00e9ance de l\u2019employ\u00e9 a pris naissance au cours de leur mandat et \u00e0 la condition que le recouvrement de la cr\u00e9ance aupr\u00e8s de la personne morale soit impossible ou peu probable.\n[18] Section 154 of the BCA provides as follows:\n154. Directors of a corporation are solidarily liable to the employees of a corporation for all debts not exceeding six months\u2019 wages payable to each such employee for services performed for the corporation while they are directors of the corporation respectively.\n154. Les administrateurs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sont solidairement responsables envers ses employ\u00e9s, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de six mois de salaire, pour les services rendus \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pendant leur administration respective.\nHowever, a director is not liable unless the corporation is sued for the debt within one year after it becomes due and the notice of execution is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part or unless, during that period, a liquidation order is made against the corporation or it becomes bankrupt within the meaning of that expression in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3) and a claim for the debt is filed with the liquidator or the syndic.\nToutefois, leur responsabilit\u00e9 n\u2019est engag\u00e9e que si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est poursuivie dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e du jour o\u00f9 la dette est devenue exigible et que l\u2019avis d\u2019ex\u00e9cution du jugement obtenu contre elle est rapport\u00e9 insatisfait en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie ou si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, pendant cette p\u00e9riode, fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une ordonnance de mise en liquidation ou devient faillie au sens de la Loi sur la faillite et l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 (L.R.C. 1985, c. B-3) et qu\u2019une r\u00e9clamation de cette dette est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du liquidateur ou du syndic.\n[19] As noted above, the Board relies on Western Express to justify the application of section 154 of the BCA in the case at hand. This case involves the restructuring of a business under the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36, which was followed by a bankruptcy a few months later. The Supreme Court of British Columbia was required to rule on the amounts that may be claimed from the directors of the insolvent corporation under section 251.18 of the Code. Noting that the Code does not provide for a specific time limit for issuing a payment order, the Court considered the relationship between section 251.18 of the Code and section 119 of the Canada Business Corporations Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-44 (CBCA), which deals with directors\u2019 liability to employees. The Court considers that the issue before it is whether the provisions of the Code and the CBCA are conflicting, contradictory or incompatible with each other.\n[20] The Supreme Court of British Columbia determined that the presumption of overlap applies. This presumption establishes that, where the provisions of different statutes overlap, their interpretation must ensure that contradictions are avoided wherever possible. The Court finds that each provision provides for the establishment of general liability for directors: for the Code, with no limitation on when to make a claim to a director, and for the CBCA, requiring that a claim be proved within six months of an assignment or a bankruptcy order. The Court finds that section 119 of the CBCA does not conflict with section 251.18 of the Code and that, as a result, a formal payment order issued against a director of a CBCA corporation is valid only, when the corporation has become bankrupt, to the extent that a proof of claim is filed with the trustee within six months of the bankruptcy order, pursuant to paragraph 119(2)(c) of the CBCA (Western Express at paras. 18\u201320, 22\u201323).\n[21] In the case at hand, considering that [translation] \u201cthe situation created by the combination of the provisions of the Code and the [BCA] is, to some extent, comparable to the situation considered\u201d in Western Express, the Board finds \u201cstatute barred since the expiry of the time limit set out in section 154 of the [BCA]\u201d claims of former employees who have not submitted a proof of claim to the trustee (at paras. 58, 61\u201362).\n[22] However, the Board\u2019s analysis does not consider the fact that Western Express deals with the application of two federal statutes. In the case at hand, it is the application of a provincial statute to a plan established by a federal statute. The analysis differs depending on whether two statutes passed by the same legislator can coexist without conflict or whether a provincial statute can supplement a federal statute if it is silent (see, in particular, Ruth Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes, 7th ed., Markham, ON, LexisNexis, 2022, \u00a7 11.03[4]; Canada (Attorney General) v. St-Hilaire, 2001 FCA 63, leave to appeal to the SCC denied, 28643 (November 29, 2001). The Board\u2019s reasons do not make that distinction.\n[23] Furthermore, the Board does not make any comparative analysis of the provisions at issue and, in particular, does not consider whether there are differences between section 119 of the CBCA and section 154 of the BCA. It is therefore difficult to understand how it could assimilate the two provisions and give them the same effect because although they are similar in several respects, there are differences between them.\n[24] In this regard, it is important to reproduce the following excerpts from section 119 of the CBCA:\n119 (1) Directors of a corporation are jointly and severally, or solidarily, liable to employees of the corporation for all debts not exceeding six months wages payable to each such employee for services performed for the corporation while they are such directors respectively.\n119 (1) Les administrateurs sont solidairement responsables, envers les employ\u00e9s de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, des dettes li\u00e9es aux services que ceux-ci ex\u00e9cutent pour le compte de cette derni\u00e8re pendant qu\u2019ils exercent leur mandat, et ce jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de six mois de salaire.\n(2) A director is not liable under subsection (1) unless\n(2) La responsabilit\u00e9 des administrateurs n\u2019est engag\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe (1) que dans l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des cas suivants :\n(c) the corporation has made an assignment or a bankruptcy order has been made against it under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and a claim for the debt has been proved within six months after the date of the assignment or bankruptcy order.\nc) l\u2019existence de la cr\u00e9ance est \u00e9tablie dans les six mois d\u2019une cession de biens ou d\u2019une ordonnance de faillite frappant la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi sur la faillite et l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9.\n(3) A director, unless sued for a debt referred to in subsection (1) while a director or within two years after ceasing to be a director, is not liable under this section.\n(3) La responsabilit\u00e9 des administrateurs n\u2019est engag\u00e9e en vertu du pr\u00e9sent article que si l\u2019action est intent\u00e9e durant leur mandat ou dans les deux ans suivant la cessation de celui-ci.\n[25] As you can see, paragraph 119(2)(c) of the CBCA requires that directors\u2019 liability be incurred only if the existence of the wage claim is established within six months of an assignment or a bankruptcy order made against the corporation under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. With respect to section 154 of the BCA, directors\u2019 liability is incurred only if the corporation, within one year after the debt becomes due, is subject to a winding-up order or becomes bankrupt and a claim for that debt is filed with the liquidator or the trustee. It is unclear from section 154 of the BCA as to whether the one-year time limit also applies to the filing of a proof of claim with the liquidator or the trustee. In addition, under subsection 119(3) of the CBCA, directors\u2019 liability is incurred only if the action is brought during a directors\u2019 term or within two years after ceasing to be a director. The BCA does not provide for a specific time limit for the exercise of the recourse against the directors.\n[26] In light of these provisions, the requirement in the second paragraph of section 154 of the BCA to file a proof of claim with the trustee is more akin to a precondition engaging the directors\u2019 liability than a limitation period.\n[27] The Board also does not consider the appropriateness of applying Western Express in light of the changes made to the Code since that decision. In 2006, the Code did not provide for a time limit for an employee to file a complaint of unpaid wages or other amounts by the employer. Under subsection 251.01(2) of the Code, the employee now has six months to do so, from the last date the employer should have paid the wages or amounts under Part III of the Code. This time limit was added to the Code in 2012 (Jobs and Growth Act, 2012, S.C. 2012, c. 31, s. 223) and came into force in 2014 (Order in Council P.C. 2014-0162).\n[28] In relying on provincial law, the Board should have also considered whether it was appropriate to import the general three-year prescription period enacted by article 2925 of the Civil Code of Quebec (Duverger v. 2553-4330 Qu\u00e9bec Inc. (A\u00e9ropro), 2016 FCA 243 at para. 24; Abel v. Asselin, 2014 FC 66 at para. 38) and determine whether this limitation period was interrupted, either by the filing of the complaint on October 2, 2015, or by the sending of the Preliminary Letters of Determination to the former directors in 2018 (Abel at paras. 41\u201342; Bernlohr c. Anciens employ\u00e9s d\u2019Aveos Performance A\u00e9ronautique Inc., 2018 CanLII 146966 at paras. 89, 102\u2013123).\n[29] Furthermore, the Board\u2019s reasons also do not address the context and purpose of the Code. Section 251.18 is found in Part III of the Code, which deals generally with labour standards. The Board does not consider whether the application of section 154 of the BCA is consistent with the purpose of Part III of the Code or whether it has the effect of disregarding the intention Parliament had when it enacted section 251.18 of the Code (Bank of Montreal v. Hall, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 121 at 151\u2013152). Its reasons do not take into account subsection 168(1) of the Code, which provides that Part III of the Code applies notwithstanding any other law or any custom, contract or arrangement, unless it is more favourable to employees, or precedents that have ruled that the Code is a complete whole (Ridke v. Coulson Aircrane Ltd., 2013 FC 1183 at para. 101; Misty Press v. 942260 Ontario Ltd., 2004 FC 1384 at para. 18) or having interpreted the purpose of Part III of the Code (Dynamex Canada Inc. v. Mamona, 2003 FCA 248).\n[30] Although the Board did not have to engage in a formalistic interpretation of section 251.18 of the Code, its reasons do not demonstrate that it was aware that the decision had to be consistent with the modern principle of legislative interpretation under which the interpretation must consider the text, context, and purpose of the statute (Vavilov at paras. 117\u2013\u200d123).\n[31] Finally, I note some confusion in the Board\u2019s reasoning. When discussing its limitation period analysis, the Board refers to the lapse between the time of the corporation\u2019s bankruptcy and the Preliminary Determination Inspector\u2019s letter sent to the corporation\u2019s other director on September 13, 2018. It states that although this time limit may seem long, it [translation] \u201cremains to be seen whether this time limit causes the payment order to be rescinded because it is time-barred\u201d (at para. 50). While these comments appear to refer to both the time limit for the inspector to notify directors of their personal liability and the duration of her investigation, the Board\u2019s analysis and finding focus on what appears to be to a condition for bringing a recourse against the directors (at paras. 56\u201362).\n[32] Some decisions focused on the time available to the inspector to investigate, that is, to notify the directors that they could be held liable under section 251.18 of the Code or to issue a payment order (Abel at paras. 46, 49; Bernlohr at paras. 89, 102\u2013123; Re Rutherford and Doyle, 2013 CarswellNat 1199 at paras. 61\u201365). The Board\u2019s reasons do not support the conclusion that this is the time limit the Board is concerned with.\n[33] The lack of analysis, justification, and consistency in the Board\u2019s reasons makes it difficult to understand the basis for the decision. It follows that the Court\u2019s intervention is justified (Vavilov at paras. 85\u201386, 105).\n[34] In closing, I would like to make a few additional comments.\n[35] The lack of information and documentation on the applicant\u2019s record did not make this Court\u2019s work easy. At the hearing, the Court raised its questions and concerns about certain elements of the record with the Attorney General.\n[36] For example, the Court questioned the interaction between the provisions of the Code, the Wage Earner Protection Program Act, S.C. 2005, c. 47, s. 1, which provides for payments to individuals in respect of wages owed to them by employers who are insolvent, and the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.\n[37] One reason for this question is that at paragraph 10 of its reasons, the Board mentions that the [translation] \u201ccomplaint\u201d dated October 2, 2015, was filed with the Wage Earner Protection Program. However, at paragraph 7 of his memorandum, the Attorney General states that the complaint was filed under section 251.01 of the Code. The inspector\u2019s affidavit is of no assistance as it does not explicitly state the basis of the complaint.\n[38] Since at first glance a claim for benefits under the Wage Earner Protection Program Act differs from a complaint of unpaid wages or other amounts under section 251.01 of the Code, it would have been helpful if the Court could confirm under which plan the \u201ccomplaint\u201d dated October 2, 2015, was filed. This is especially true given that eligibility for the Wage Earner Protection Program is based on the bankruptcy of the business, which explains the importance of filing a proof of claim with the trustee, referred to at paragraph 15(1)(d) of the Wage Earner Protection Program Regulations, S.O.R.\/2008-222. The time limit for filing a complaint under the Code (paragraph 251.01(2)(a)) is also different from the time limit for filing a claim under the Wage Earner Protection Program (Regulations, section 9). Unfortunately, a copy of the \u201ccomplaint\u201d is not on the applicant\u2019s record.\n[39] Moreover, in her report prepared following Mr. Monette\u2019s request for review, the inspector states that 35 employees had registered with the Wage Earner Protection Program at the time of bankruptcy claiming payment of wages and various amounts under the Code. She also states that she had [translation] \u201cclaimed for employees who have not registered in the Wage Earner Protection Program according to the instructions received based on Western Express Air Lines (Appendix 2) as the corporation is registered in the \u2018Registraire des entreprises du Qu\u00e9bec\u2019\u201d (Applicant\u2019s record at 91).\n[40] On the one hand, the instructions on which the inspector relies are not on the record. Given that the Board expressly states that it does not agree with the inspector\u2019s interpretation of Western Express, it would have been useful to have an explanation of the contents of these instructions, even if they are not binding on the Court.\n[41] On the other hand, the source of the authority allowing the inspector to extend her investigation to all employees and to claim from the directors the unpaid amounts for all employees cannot be determined from the record. At the hearing, the Attorney General explained that the Inspector\u2019s authority to investigate derived from sections 248 and 249 of the Code and that a single complaint was valid for all employees, even if they did not file a complaint within the time limit prescribed by the Code.\n[42] The record does not show whether the inspector issued a notice to the former directors informing them that she would investigate for the benefit of all the former employees of the bankrupt business or whether she had been in contact with Mr. Monette before sending him the revised Letter of Determination more than three years after the corporation\u2019s bankruptcy. Mr. Monette states in his request for review that he did not receive a copy of the complaints that led to the inspector\u2019s investigation or the mandate that was given to the inspector. However, the date of these communications could be decisive if the inspector had three years to inform Mr. Monette of his personal liability for wages and other unpaid amounts in the case of an investigation conducted under the Code.\n[43] I will leave it at that. I leave it up to the Board to consider these issues.\n[44] For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that this application for judicial review should be allowed, I would set aside the Board\u2019s decision and return the matter to the Board, differently constituted, for a new decision considering these reasons. As the Attorney General no longer asks for them in his memorandum, I propose that no costs be awarded.\n\u201cSylvie E.

Introduction and the basic facts\n[1] Teksavvy Solutions Inc. appeals from a decision of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission: CRTC-2021-181. In this decision, the CRTC varied a 2019 decision: Telecom Order CRTC 2019-288. In the 2019 decision, the CRTC set certain rates, as described below.\n[2] Here, the setting of rates is in pursuit of a larger regulatory policy. To promote competition in the offering of internet services to the public, the CRTC requires telecommunications companies to provide Teksavvy, and other competing internet service providers, access to their internet facilities and infrastructure: Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015-326. Once they have access, Teksavvy and others can provide internet access to their own retail customers.\n[3] In return for gaining access to internet facilities and infrastructure, Teksavvy and others must pay rates to the telecommunications companies. This is only fair, as the telecommunications companies have planned, built and maintained their facilities and infrastructure\u2014often with great innovation and considerable cost in an environment fraught with risk.\n[4] Some, including the respondents, were unhappy with the 2019 decision. To them, the rates that the CRTC set were too low. So they applied for leave, were granted leave, and appealed against the 2019 decision to this Court. Teksavvy opposed the appeal. This Court dismissed the appeal: Bell Canada v. British Columbia Broadband Association, 2020 FCA 140, [2021] 3 F.C.R. 206. This left the 2019 decision in place.\n[5] But that was only one little chapter in this saga. And it was far from the last.\n[6] The CRTC can review and vary its decisions: Telecommunications Act, S.C. 1993, c. 38, s. 62. Some of those unhappy with the 2019 decision, including the respondents, asked the CRTC to vary it. They pointed out flaws in it, most particularly the CRTC\u2019s costing methodology that, they said, caused serious harm and undercut certain purposes set out in the Act.\n[7] In a seventy-five page, highly detailed and technical decision\u2014the decision Teksavvy seeks to quash in this appeal\u2014the CRTC decided to change or vary its 2019 decision: CRTC 2021-181. The CRTC had \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d as to the correctness of the rates it had set. Indeed, in its view, the 2019 decision was well wide of the mark: the decision was substantially incorrect on 13 of 14 issues.\n[8] The result? Gone were the favourable rates that Teksavvy and others like it had in the 2019 decision. In its place were higher rates that bore some similarity to those the CRTC previously set in 2016: Telecom Decision CRTC 2016-117. The CRTC found that the higher rates were supported under a particular cost methodology and for a number of policy reasons.\n[9] The CRTC was not alone in its dissatisfaction with the 2019 decision. The Governor in Council was also unhappy. One year after the 2019 decision, in an Order in Council dated August 13, 2020, it criticized the 2019 decision for, among other things, failing to \u201cappropriately balance the objectives of the wholesale services framework\u201d and \u201cundermin[ing] investment in high-quality networks\u201d: Order in Council, PC 2020-0553 (13 August 2020).\n[10] Understandably unhappy with the CRTC\u2019s reversal of the 2019 decision, Teksavvy sought and was granted leave to appeal it to this Court.\n[11] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss Teksavvy\u2019s appeal with costs.\nB. The permissible scope of this appeal\n[12] Rate-setting and how to go about rate-setting are matters of discretion and policy founded on industry appreciation and specialized technical study\u2014matters resting at the very core of the CRTC\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction under the Telecommunications Act. They are something very much in the wheelhouse of the CRTC and are alien to us. For the most part, as an appeal court, we mainly handle matters of law and related matters such as procedural fairness. For the most part, we do not decide the merits of matters, especially those that draw on industry appreciation and specialized technical study.\n[13] For this reason, Parliament has restricted us to a very limited role. Under subsection 64(1) of the Act, we can deal with only \u201cquestion[s] of law or of jurisdiction\u201d and, even then, only with leave. This Court\u2019s decision in Canadian National Railway Company v. Emerson Milling Inc., 2017 FCA 79, [2018] 2 F.C.R. 573 tells us much about this limit.\n[14] The phrase \u201cquestion[s] of law\u201d in subsection 64(1) of the Act means purely legal questions and extricable legal principles, not factually suffused and discretionary questions of mixed law and fact, and still less, questions of fact: Emerson at paras. 20-28 (decided under a substantially similar provision, s. 41(1), in the Canada Transportation Act, S.C. 1996, c. 10).\n[15] The word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in subsection 64(1) of the Act includes concerns about whether a CRTC proceeding was conducted fairly: Emerson at paras. 14-19.\n[16] Often we will deny leave to appeal because the party seeking to appeal has not raised a question we can consider. When that happens, the appeal is doomed to fail or cannot be said to be \u201cfairly arguable\u201d: Apotex Inc. v. Allergan Inc., 2020 FCA 208 at para. 8; Luk\u00e1cs v. Swoop Inc., 2019 FCA 14; Lufthansa German Airlines v. Canadian Transportation Agency, 2005 FCA 295, 346 N.R. 79 at para. 9; Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development) v. Rafuse, 2002 FCA 31, 222 F.T.R. 160 at para. 12; Martin v. Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development) (1999), 252 N.R. 141, 178 F.T.R. 159 (F.C.A.) at para. 7.\n[17] But even where we grant leave, this issue always remains live: whether we have a \u201cquestion of law or of jurisdiction\u201d before us under subsection 64(1) goes to our subject-matter jurisdiction. We cannot take on things that Parliament forbids us to take: see Emerson at para. 9, citing Green v. Rutherforth (1750), 27 E.R. 1144, 1 Ves. Sen. 462, at 471; Penn v. Lord Baltimore (1750), 27 E.R. 1132, 1 Ves. Sen. 444, at 446; Attorney General v. Lord Hotham (1827), 38 E.R. 631, 3 Russ. 415; Thompson v. Sheil (1840), 3 Ir. Eq. R. 135. And of even longer standing is the principle of legislative supremacy, one corollary of which is that Parliament\u2019s laws bind courts, just like everyone else: Re: Resolution to amend the Constitution, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 753, 125 D.L.R. (3d) 1 at 805-806 S.C.R.; Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217, 161 D.L.R. (4th) 385 at paras. 71\u201372; Ref. re Remuneration of Judges of the Prov. Court of P.E.I.; Ref. re Independence and Impartiality of Judges of the Prov. Court of P.E.I., [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3, 150 D.L.R. (4th) 577 at para. 101.\n[18] In considering our jurisdiction in cases like this, we must remain on high alert. The say-so of a party that a \u201clegal test\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d is involved is not enough. \u201cSkilful pleaders\u201d who are \u201carmed with sophisticated wordsmithing tools and cunning minds\u201d can express grounds in such a way as to make them sound like legal questions \u201cwhen they are nothing of the sort\u201d: JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc. v. Canada (National Revenue), 2013 FCA 250, [2014] 2 F.C.R. 557 at para. 49. Put another way, \u201cthe mere say-so of a party that a \u2018legal test\u2019 is implicated\u201d or the expression of grounds of appeal \u201cin an artful way to make them appear to raise legal questions when they do not\u201d is \u201cinsufficient to found an appeal\u201d: British Columbia Broadband at para. 51.\n[19] Instead, we must look at the substance of what is being raised, not the form. See generally JP Morgan at paras. 49-50, cited in Emerson at para. 29; British Columbia Broadband at para. 51.\n[20] In this appeal, Teksavvy gamely offers a number of grounds for setting aside the CRTC\u2019s rates decision and phrases them as legal issues to get past the limitation in subsection 64(1). However, in my view, Teksavvy\u2019s real concern is disagreement with the policy adopted by the CRTC and the discretion it exercised in setting the rates, matters that we are powerless to address.\nC. Must the CRTC\u2019s decision be quashed because the CRTC erred in law by not using any \u201cmethod\u201d or \u201ctechnique\u201d in setting the rates?\n[21] Teksavvy submits that the CRTC committed an error of law by failing to apply any \u201cmethod\u201d or \u201ctechnique\u201d in establishing the revised rates. Teksavvy formulates its submission in that way in order to cast this ground as an error of law. In my view, in reality, Teksavvy takes issue with the methods and techniques adopted by the CRTC that led it to adopt rates that Teksavvy does not like\u2014matters that cannot be raised in an appeal to this Court.\n[22] In this case, the CRTC was to set rates. The rates have to be \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d: Telecommunications Act, s. 27(1). This is a \u201cfactually suffused question of mixed law and fact\u201d, one that cannot be entertained in an appeal under subsection 64(1) of the Act: British Columbia Broadband at para. 66. Indeed, it is a question filled with broad policy considerations set out in the Act and discretions exercised by expert decision-makers, not objective legal principle: Bell Canada v. Bell Aliant Regional Communications, 2009 SCC 40, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 764; Allstream Corp. v. Bell Canada, 2005 FCA 247, 338 N.R. 177 at paras. 27-28, 31 and 34.\n[23] Subsection 27(5) of the Act reinforces this, using language that is just about as broad as can be conceived: the CRTC \u201cmay adopt any method or technique that it considers appropriate [to set rates], whether based on a carrier\u2019s return on its rate base or otherwise\u201d. In the words of the Supreme Court, the CRTC \u201cmay set rates that are just and reasonable for the purposes of the Telecommunications Act through a diverse range of methods, taking into account a variety of different constituencies and interests\u201d: Bell Aliant at para. 48. As this Court said in TELUS Communications Inc. v. Canada (Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission), 2004 FCA 365, [2005] 2 F.C.R. 388 at paragraph 49, \u201cit is difficult to envisage a broader power than the one given to ensure that rates are just and reasonable at all times\u201d.\n[24] Teksavvy submits that the terms \u201cmethod\u201d and \u201ctechnique\u201d in subsection 27(5) of the Act mean that the CRTC must adopt a \u201cconcrete procedure that can be calculated using observable evidence or data\u201d.\n[25] In my view, the text, context and purpose of subsection 27(5) do not require the CRTC to adopt such a procedure. Instead, the words seem aimed at ensuring that the CRTC use some defensible, articulable methodology in setting rates to ensure good decision-making standards and accountability. Put conversely, subsection 27(5) aims at preventing the CRTC from arbitrarily inventing numbers just because it says so, forcing everyone else to trust it.\n[26] I offer several reasons in support of that conclusion and against Teksavvy\u2019s submission.\n[27] The text of subsection 27(5) states that in setting a rate that is \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d, the CRTC \u201cmay\u201d adopt \u201cany\u201d method or technique\u2014words both permissive and open ended. Teksavvy\u2019s interpretation seeks to constrain the CRTC far more than the statutory language does.\n[28] The plain meaning of \u201cmethod\u201d and \u201ctechnique\u201d is broader and more general than Teksavvy\u2019s constrained meaning that requires rigid concreteness, calculability and a solely objective basis. A \u201cmethod\u201d is just a way of doing something. And a \u201ctechnique\u201d is nothing more than a particular way of doing something.\n[29] The setting of \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates in this context is not something that tumbles out of a calculator once the numbers are punched in. Instead, it is suffused by policy considerations, informed by multiple, often conflicting inputs, over which reasonable minds may differ, including regulatory experience, subjective weighings and assessments, factual appreciation, and many rival methodologies. How to arrive at a rate involves more than the processing of information objectively and logically against fixed, legal criteria. Rather, it is a complex, multifaceted decision involving sensitive weighings of information, impressions and indications using criteria that may shift and be weighed differently from time to time depending upon changing and evolving circumstances and regulatory experience. See, for example, the similar rate-setting context discussed in CMRRA-SODRAC Inc. v. Apple Canada Inc., 2020 FCA 101 at paras. 49-50.\n[30] The idea that a \u201cmethod\u201d or \u201ctechnique\u201d must always be concrete, calculable and based solely on objective data simply does not fit the practical reality of the exercise under subsection 27(5) of the Act.\n[31] Here, the CRTC did not pluck figures from the air or throw darts at a dartboard. Instead, it relied on the 2016 decision that set rates and the \u201cPhase II Costing Methodology\u201d, a method or technique it thought about and adopted for reasons that made sense to it on the evidence and based on its regulatory experience and policy appreciation: see the decision under appeal at paras. 293-297 and 304.\nD. As a matter of law, are there enforceable \u201clegitimate expectations\u201d in this case?\n[32] Teksavvy submits that the CRTC led Teksavvy to have an expectation that the CRTC would conduct an exhaustive costing exercise in establishing the revised rates. It cites the CRTC\u2019s statement that final rates would be established based on a \u201cfull assessment and review of costing inputs and costing methodologies\u201d: Telecom Order 2016-396 at para. 26.\n[33] Bell Canada submits that this statement was nothing more than a promise that the final rates would be based on a full record and, in the end, they were. It says that the statement was not a promise to follow any particular process or an undertaking to alter its well-established practices in variation proceedings such as this. I agree. The statement that is said to be responsible for an enforceable legitimate expectation on the part of Teksavvy does not create the result Teksavvy seeks to enforce.\n[34] The respondents say that Teksavvy is impermissibly conducting an \u201cassault on the methods selected by the CRTC and its assessment of the evidence\u201d in order to quibble with the rates set. That wording ironically comes from this Court\u2019s decision rejecting a similar attempt by many of these same respondents to quash the 2019 decision by transforming a policy disagreement\u2014not litigable in this court\u2014into a legal matter: British Columbia Broadband at para. 67.\n[35] This much is certain: Teksavvy\u2019s submission fails on multiple grounds.\n[36] First, it relies too heavily on a single statement at a single point of time. The CRTC\u2019s decision in this case was not made in isolation. Rather, it was the latest chapter in a complex, ongoing regulatory dispute.\n[37] There are times when a regulatory decision is merely the latest chapter in a saga where many chapters are written. There are also times when regulatory statements, conduct or decisions are so intimately related to earlier events that they cannot be taken in isolation. In those situations, the Court must evaluate the matter in light of the whole context, not just an isolated event. See Bell Canada v. 7262591 Canada Ltd. (Gusto TV), 2016 FCA 123, 17 Admin. L.R. (6th) 175 at paras. 13-15; Canadian National Railway Company v. Canada (Transportation Agency), 2023 FCA 245 at para. 16; David Suzuki Foundation v. Canada (Health), 2019 FC 1637 at para. 36; Office and Professional Employees International Union v. Cougar Helicopters Inc., 2019 FCA 231 at para. 10.\n[38] In this case, the exhaustive costing exercise to establish the revised rates had already been done, in the three-year rate-setting process that started in 2016 and culminated in the 2019 decision. In 2016, the CRTC analyzed cost studies submitted by facilities-based carriers and made adjustments based on the Commission\u2019s application of the \u201cPhase II Costing Methodology\u201d, a well-established framework developed by the CRTC. It was in that context that the statement was made: the CRTC noted that \u201c[t]he establishment of the final rates will be based on a full review and assessment of the relevant cost inputs and costing methodologies\u201d: Telecom Order CRTC 2016-396 at paras. 23 and 26.\n[39] Over the next three years, culminating in the 2019 decision, that is exactly what the CRTC did. It received enormous amounts of information and materials and dozens of submissions from industry participants, forming a record of thousands of pages of complex and highly technical information, which was placed before this Court in the appeal of the 2019 decision in British Columbia Broadband, above.\n[40] Post 2019, the CRTC did not need to repeat or expand the extensive rate-setting process it had already engaged in. It concluded that the complex costing analysis it had conducted in the 2016-2019 period, along with certain additions to the record before it in the variation proceeding, allowed it to find that the rates decided upon in the 2016 decision were \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d, with some adjustments. Teksavvy concedes as much: memorandum of fact and law at paras. 60-61; see also the CRTC\u2019s decision at para. 304. There were other important regulatory objectives at work here too: the completion of the transition \u201cto the adoption of disaggregated wholesale HSA service\u201d and the provision of critical certainty and finality. And given that the process of complex costing analysis had already been done, Teksavvy had no legitimate expectation that it would be needlessly repeated after the 2019 decision.\n[41] In fact, there are a number of decisions where, due to the issue and circumstances before it and the nature of its past work, the CRTC has not re-done analyses or conducted fresh analyses and has finalized what were previously interim rates: Telecom Decision CRTC 2006-14 (29 March 2006) at paras. 53-54; Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC 2013-180 (28 March 2013) at paras. 37 and 98-99; Telecom Order CRTC 2020-224 (15 July 2020) at paras. 6, 9 and 11-12; Telecom Decision 97-8 (1 May 1997) at paras. 190, 192, 227; Telecom Order CRTC 99-1127 (8 December 1999) at paras. 36-38, 55, 60, 62, 64 and 69-70; Telecom Order CRTC 2007-20 (25 January 2007) at para. 179; Telecom Decision CRTC 2007-77 (31 August 2007) at paras. 17-19. This Court has suggested that the CRTC \u201cis given a great amount of latitude in determining which method or technique it will use in determining the appropriateness of the rate\u201d: Allstream at para. 30.\n[42] Second, as a matter of law, Teksavvy\u2019s submission fails on multiple fronts.\n[43] To be held to its representations, a public authority must, among other things, make representations that are clear, unambiguous and unqualified such that \u201chad they been made in the context of a private law contract, they would be sufficiently certain to be capable of enforcement\u201d: Canada v. Mavi, 2011 SCC 30, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 504 at paras. 68-69. I am not satisfied that the representation here, general as it was, is as clear as Teksavvy submits.\n[44] As well, it must be recalled that \u201clegitimate expectations\u201d is only one of the factors to be considered in determining whether procedural fairness was met: Canada (Attorney General) v. Honey Fashions Ltd., 2020 FCA 64, 445 D.L.R. (4th) 522 at para. 51. Teksavvy had a full and fair opportunity to participate in the entire regulatory process before the CRTC, including by addressing the costing errors and proposed rates that the respondents had identified, and it exercised that opportunity. Here, overall, procedural fairness was met.\n[45] Further, where an administrative decision-maker \u201cexercises discretionary power in the public interest\u201d, it might have to take legitimate expectations into account but \u201cdoes not necessarily [have to] fulfil them\u201d: Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Vancouver (City), 2006 SCC 5, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 227 at para. 48.\n[46] Only procedural expectations are protected, not substantive expectations such as an expectation that a particular methodology would be followed: Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559 at para. 97; Reference re Canada Assistance Plan (B.C.), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 525, 83 D.L.R. (4th) 297 at 557. The alleged legitimate expectation here is a substantive one, that a particular rate-setting method would be followed.\n[47] The application of the doctrine of legitimate expectations in this context is particularly problematic in light of the CRTC\u2019s ability under section 62 of the Act to \u201creview and rescind or vary any decision made by it\u201d. The CRTC has the power to reverse an earlier wrong or unwise decision and should not be fettered by statements it may have made in a different context at a different time by a different author.\n[48] Finally, if Teksavvy had a legitimate expectation that the process leading up to the decision under review would mirror the three-year rate-setting process conducted between 2016 and 2019 and if that expectation were procedural in nature, Teksavvy should have made that position known to the CRTC while it was considering its decision. Here, Teksavvy raises this issue for the first time on appeal. As shall be seen in the discussion on the next issue, that it is not open to it.\n[49] Before leaving the subject of procedural fairness, Teksavvy raises one additional procedural point. It submits that the CRTC never advised the parties during the variation proceeding that it might finalize the rates. But Bell Canada in its application requested that very relief. The issue was live and Teksavvy had ample notice of it and a full opportunity to participate.\nE. Was the CRTC impermissibly biased such that its decision should be quashed?\n[50] Teksavvy submits that the CRTC was impermissibly biased in this case. This sort of procedural ground can be raised in an appeal under subsection 64(1) of the Act because it goes to \u201cjurisdiction\u201d: Emerson, above.\n[51] In support of its bias allegation, Teksavvy cites certain public comments in speeches the Chair of the CRTC delivered. In those comments, the Chair stressed the importance of facilities-based competition, i.e., making telecommunications companies provide access to Teksavvy and other competitors to their facilities for a fee.\n[52] This complaint has no merit. The Chair was doing nothing more than setting out the longstanding and frequently expressed policy position of the CRTC in general terms. As the Chair of a high-profile regulatory body, it was appropriate for him to communicate the policies of the regulator, as had been adopted in CRTC decisions and notices. Such communication can be constructive and in the public interest: Z\u00fcndel v. Canada (Attorney General), [1999] 4 F.C. 289, 175 D.L.R. (4th) 512 (T.D.) at paras. 28-30, aff\u2019d (2000), 195 D.L.R. (4th) 394, 30 Admin. L.R. (3d) 82 (C.A.) at para. 3. By no means was the Chair expressing a preference for the specific positions taken by parties in a specific file before the CRTC, nor was he communicating a permanent, irrevocable policy preference.\n[53] Further, the Chair made the impugned public comments before the decision under appeal was made by the CRTC. The comments were known to Teksavvy. But Teksavvy did not raise any objection or complaint to the CRTC before the CRTC made its decision. For reasons developed in more detail below, it was incumbent on Teksavvy to object to the comments on a timely basis, not wait until the decision against it had been made.\n[54] Teksavvy raises another incident that it says gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, one that on different facts and circumstances could indeed be problematic. Teksavvy says that the Chair of the CRTC met with a senior officer of the respondent, Bell Canada, while the matter leading to the decision in issue here was pending before the CRTC. For good measure, Teksavvy adds that the Chair attended ten other meetings with industry officials between November 2019 and the date of the decision under appeal. It is unclear whether the Chair attended alone or with other CRTC officials.\n[55] For a number of reasons, this allegation of bias fails.\n[56] Bell filed a report under the Lobbying Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 44 (4th Supp.), and listed the purpose of the meeting as \u201cbroadcasting\u201d, not \u201ctelecommunications\u201d. The lobbying report is the only roughly contemporaneous record of what was discussed at the meeting. This is evidence that the rates applications in this telecommunications matter were not discussed.\n[57] Another fundamental obstacle lies in Teksavvy\u2019s way on this submission: waiver. Knowing about the Chair\u2019s meeting with the senior officer of Bell Canada while the rates applications were pending, Teksavvy did not raise the issue with the CRTC. Instead, it kept the issue to itself until the CRTC released its decision, a decision that went against it.\n[58] It is trite law that a party that knows of a procedural flaw, defect or irregularity with an administrative process must raise it with the administrative decision-maker as soon as reasonably possible. Failure to do so constitutes waiver of the flaw, defect or irregularity. It cannot be raised in a judicial review or a statutory appeal of the administrative decision. See Irving Shipbuilding Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2009 FCA 116, [2010] 2 F.C.R. 488 at para. 48; Canada (Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities) v. Farwaha, 2014 FCA 56, [2015] 2 F.C.R. 1006 at para. 113; Telus Communications Inc. v. Telecommunications Workers Union, 2005 FCA 262, 257 D.L.R. (4th) 19 at paras. 43-49; Kozak v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FCA 124, [2006] 4 F.C.R. 377 at para. 66.\n[59] There are many good reasons supporting this legal rule.\n[60] Raising an issue with the administrative decision-maker as soon as reasonably possible gives the decision-maker a chance to review the situation and correct any mistake or oversight it has made before any prejudice results. Where a mistake or oversight cannot be corrected, steps might nevertheless be taken that can mitigate any prejudice.\n[61] If the issue matters to a party\u2014and is not merely trivial\u2014and if it has arguable merit, one would expect that a party would raise it as soon as reasonably possible.\n[62] Finally\u2014and in making this point, I cast no aspersions on Teksavvy here, which genuinely and in good faith pursued this submission\u2014it is unseemly for a party to notice that a mistake or oversight has been made and then hide in the weeds, ready to pounce should the case go against it. Such a party has no real interest in correcting the mistake or oversight but rather wishes, for tactical reasons, to take out some insurance against an adverse result. Our administrative law never rewards purely tactical behaviour that benefits a party to the detriment of the larger public interest or the proper administration of justice.\n[63] Thus, as Teksavvy did not raise the issue of this meeting while the CRTC was still considering its rates decision, it cannot raise the issue in this appeal.\n[64] Before closing on this issue, this Court has a general power of supervision over federal tribunals and it would be remiss if it did not offer a word or two about meetings between a regulator and a frequent party before it, such as the one in this case.\n[65] Meetings between regulators and regulatees outside of the hearing room are a tricky area.\n[66] At one end of the spectrum are meetings that are in the public interest, particularly where the regulator has a policy-making mandate and the regulator and the regulatee are in a long term relationship. Regulators need to understand the industry they regulate and the parties in it, their challenges, needs, aspirations, and plans. And regulatees need to understand the motivations of regulators, their view of the public interest and their need to protect it. It is evident from the register maintained under the Lobbying Act, most regulatees in sectors such as this engage in these meetings. It is accepted that they are part of doing business. For good measure, the preamble to the Lobbying Act has declared lobbying to be a \u201clegitimate activity\u201d. And the CRTC\u2019s Code of Conduct correctly recognizes that \u201c[f]ormal and informal contacts with parties with an interest in the communications industry are essential to maintaining and enhancing our expertise and knowledge\u201d.\n[67] At the other end of the spectrum are meetings to discuss live issues coming before the regulator or already before the regulator for hearing and decision. In effect, these meetings are means by which secret submissions can be offered outside of the hearing room, away from the eyes and ears of other parties to the hearing and the public. This subverts fairness and should not happen.\n[68] Somewhere in the middle are social gatherings. The CRTC\u2019s Code of Conduct permits attendance at social events and other meetings between CRTC members and industry representatives as long as CRTC members do not discuss matters before the CRTC during the events. But this can still invite unwelcome questions that can multiply, with mounting risk.\n[69] Looking at this case as an example, why were the two together? What was discussed? Why were just the two of them there without any witnesses? Quite simply, meetings between two people, one a regulator and one a regulatee, without any independent witnesses or other evidence to substantiate why the meeting happened and what was discussed can be a recipe for trouble.\n[70] In the evidentiary record before us is a CRTC policy that offers good practical guidance on this issue. It recognizes the benefits of regulator-regulatee meetings. But it also flags the risks and offers some ways the risks can be mitigated. For example, among other things, the policy suggests that a senior Commission staff person be present at such meetings. It also suggests that the purposes of the meeting be confirmed in writing.\n[71] In the end, though, based on the paucity of evidence in this case, the informed, reasonable and right-minded person, viewing the matter realistically and practically and having thought the matter through, would not conclude that there was an actual or apprehended lack of impartiality on the part of the Chair: Committee for Justice and Liberty et al. v. National Energy Board et al., [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369, 68 D.L.R. (3d) 716; S. (R.D.) at para. 31.\nF. Postscript\n[72] Recognizing that the decision under appeal was pregnant with policy considerations, Teksavvy filed an expedited petition with the Governor in Council seeking to have the decision overturned and to have the rates set in the 2019 decision reinstated.\n[73] On May 19, 2022, the Governor in Council declined to act, noting that the CRTC had properly reversed its 2019 decision because of \u201ca series of material errors across different cost factors\u201d and applauding the \u201cstability\u201d the decision creates: Order in Council, PC No. 2022-0535 (May 19, 2022).\n[74] That decision, based on policy considerations rather than issues of law or jurisdiction, has been irrelevant to this Court\u2019s disposition of Teksavvy\u2019s appeal.\n[75] In closing, I would like to offer my appreciation to counsel on all sides whose submissions were skilfully made and who maximized the interests of their clients throughout.\nG.

LEBLANC J.A.\nDate: 20240723\nDocket: A-95-22\nCitation: 2024 FCA 122\nCORAM:\nSTRATAS J.A.\nRENNIE J.A.\nLEBLANC J.A.\nBETWEEN:\nREGIONAL MUNICIPALITY OF HALTON, THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF MILTON, THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF HALTON HILLS, THE CORPORATION OF THE CITY OF BURLINGTON, THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWN OF OAKVILLE and THE HALTON REGIONAL CONSERVATION AUTHORITY\nAppellants\nand\nCANADIAN TRANSPORTATION AGENCY and CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY COMPANY\nRespondents\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nSTRATAS J.A.\n[1] The Canadian National Railway Company applied to the Canadian Transportation Agency under subsection 98(2) of the Canada Transportation Act, S.C. 1996, c. 10, for the approval of the location of certain railway lines it intends to construct in the Town of Milton, Ontario. These railway lines were part of a larger project, the construction of a terminal that would be used to transfer goods from train to truck and truck to train.\n[2] Under subsection 98(2), the Agency had to be satisfied that \u201cthe location of the railway line is reasonable, taking into consideration requirements for railway operations and services and the interests of the localities that will be affected by the line\u201d. The Agency also had to be satisfied that the Crown met its duty to consult with Indigenous peoples.\n[3] On those matters, the Agency was satisfied. It granted CN\u2019s application, imposing certain conditions: Determination No. R-2021-172 (22 November 2021).\n[4] The appellants, at times collectively called \u201cHalton\u201d in these reasons, are various public authorities and municipalities that opposed CN\u2019s application. They now appeal to this Court, with leave, under subsection 41(1) of the Act. They ask this Court to quash the Agency\u2019s decision.\n[5] For the following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nA. The legal scope of this appeal [6] Subsection 41(1) limits the respondents\u2019 appeal to \u201cquestion[s] of law or\u2026jurisdiction\u201d. This Court has interpreted this to include \u201cextricable questions of law or legal principle\u201d that arise from questions of mixed fact and law and issues of procedural fairness: Canadian National Railway Company v. Emerson Milling Inc., 2017 FCA 79, [2018] 2 F.C.R. 573 at paras. 19-28.\n[7] Sometimes when a party seeks leave to appeal under subsection 41(1), the party does not raise a question we can consider. When that happens, the appeal is doomed to fail or cannot be said to be \u201cfairly arguable\u201d and we deny leave: Apotex Inc. v. Allergan Inc., 2020 FCA 208 at para. 8; Luk\u00e1cs v. Swoop Inc., 2019 FCA 14; Lufthansa German Airlines v. Canadian Transportation Agency, 2005 FCA 295, 346 N.R. 79 at para. 9; Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development) v. Rafuse, 2002 FCA 31, 222 F.T.R. 160 at para. 12; Martin v. Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development) (1999), 252 N.R. 141, 178 F.T.R. 159 (C.A.) at para. 7.\n[8] But even where we grant leave, this issue always remains live: whether we have a \u201cquestion of law or of jurisdiction\u201d before us under subsection 64(1) goes to our subject-matter jurisdiction. We cannot take on things that Parliament forbids us from taking: See Emerson at para. 9, citing Green v. Rutherforth (1750), 27 E.R. 1144, 1 Ves. Sen. 462, at page 471; Penn v. Lord Baltimore (1750), 27 E.R. 1132, 1 Ves. Sen. 444, at page 446; Attorney General v. Lord Hotham (1827), 38 E.R. 631, 3 Russ. 415; Thompson v. Sheil (1840), 3 Ir. Eq. R. 135. And of even longer standing is the principle of legislative supremacy, one corollary of which is that Parliament\u2019s laws bind courts, just like everyone else: Re: Resolution to amend the Constitution, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 753, 125 D.L.R. (3d) 1 at 805-806 S.C.R.; Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217, 161 D.L.R. (4th) 385 at paras. 71\u201372; Ref. re Remuneration of Judges of the Prov. Court of P.E.I.; Ref. re Independence and Impartiality of Judges of the Prov. Court of P.E.I., [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3, 150 D.L.R. (4th) 577 at para. 10.\n[9] In considering our jurisdiction in cases like this, we must remain on high alert. The say-so of a party that a \u201clegal test\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d is involved is not enough. \u201cSkilful pleaders\u201d who are \u201carmed with sophisticated wordsmithing tools and cunning minds\u201d can express grounds in such a way as to make them sound like legal questions \u201cwhen they are nothing of the sort\u201d: JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc. v. Canada (National Revenue), 2013 FCA 250, [2014] 2 F.C.R. 557 at para. 49. Put another way, \u201cthe mere say-so of a party that a \u2018legal test\u2019 is implicated\u201d or the expression of grounds of appeal \u201cin an artful way to make them appear to raise legal questions when they do not\u201d is \u201cinsufficient to found an appeal\u201d: Bell Canada v. British Columbia Broadband Association, 2020 FCA 140, [2021] 3 F.C.R. 206 at para. 51.\n[10] Instead, we must look at the substance of what is being raised, not the form. See generally JP Morgan at paras. 49-50, cited in Emerson at para. 29; British Columbia Broadband at para. 51.\n[11] In this appeal, Halton offers a number of grounds for setting aside the Agency\u2019s decision and phrases them as legal issues\u2014for example, adequacy of the Agency\u2019s reasons\u2014to try to get past the limitation in subsection 41(1). However, in my view, Halton\u2019s real concern is mere disagreement with the Agency\u2019s weighing of various factors and its conclusion that the location of the railway line is reasonable, matters we are powerless to address.\nB. The standard of review (1) Substantive matters [12] We must review the substantive aspects of the Agency\u2019s decision using the appellate standard of review: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653 at paras. 17, 33-52; Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at paras. 7-37. Thus, the Agency had to be correct on questions of law as defined by this Court in Emerson or, put conversely, had to avoid legal error.\n(2) Procedural matters [13] Where a party in the reviewing court submits that the administrative decision-maker did something procedurally unfair and the party did not raise the point before the administrative decision-maker, the administrative decision-maker did not make a decision on any argued procedural point. In that circumstance, it does not make sense to speak of a standard of review of a decision because, quite simply, there was no decision. In that situation, the Court should simply evaluate whether the procedures were fair within the meaning of Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, 174 D.L.R. (4th) 193 at 837-841 S.C.R. However, in that situation, since the party did not raise the point before the administrative decision-maker, the party may be precluded from raising the matter in the reviewing court due to the doctrine of waiver. In this case, more will be said about this: see paragraphs 37-38 below.\n[14] As for instances where an administrative decision-maker has made a procedural decision after receiving submissions, standard of review need not be addressed in detail in this case. The procedural issues the appellants raise in this Court largely do not implicate that situation. And due to the nature of the issues raised, they can be resolved without considering the standard of review.\nC. The Agency\u2019s interpretation of subsection 98(2) of the Act [15] The appellants have not demonstrated that the Agency committed legal error in its interpretation of subsection 98(2) of the Act. The Agency\u2019s interpretation of subsection 98(2) is consistent with its text viewed in light of its context in the Act and its purpose. Its interpretation is also consistent with previous case law of this Court concerning subsection 98(2): Canadian National Railway Co. v. Canadian Transportation Agency, 1999 CanLII 20684 (F.C.A.) (CNR 1999) at paras. 7-20; Sharp v. Canada (Transportation Agency), [1999] 4 F.C. 363 at paras. 7-16 (C.A.).\n[16] The appellants submit that the Agency erred in determining what constitutes an interest of the locality in response to a particular application under subsection 98(2) of the Act. I disagree. The words of subsection 98(2) specifically contemplate this: the Agency is to \u201c[take] into consideration requirements for railway operations and services and the interests of the localities that will be affected by the line\u201d. There is nothing in the context of the section in the wider Act or the purposes of the Act to suggest otherwise.\n[17] In CNR 1999 at para. 12 and Sharp at para. 11, this Court, interpreting subsection 98(2), held that the Agency must consider the \u201ceffect of the physical co-existence of railway lines in proximity to localities\u201d and must assess this on a case-by-case basis. This the Agency did.\n[18] The Agency properly looked at the text of subsection 98(2). It noted (at para. 31) that it had to determine whether the location of the railway line is \u201creasonable\u201d, in part by considering the interests of the localities that will be affected by the line. It also noted (at para. 245) that \u201cwhat constitutes an interest of the locality is not determined in advance, either by the statute or by any guidelines\u201d. So it decided to determine the interests of the localities on the facts. This was entirely consistent with CNR 1999 and Sharp. I see no error of law in the Agency\u2019s approach. For good measure, Halton has not identified any topic that the Agency failed to consider under the rubric of \u201cthe interests of the localities\u201d.\n[19] Halton also submits that the Agency proceeded against the proper interpretation of subsection 98(2) by wrongly \u201cweighing\u201d the two subsection 98(2) considerations rather than \u201cbalancing\u201d them. Subsection 98(2) does not refer to \u201cbalancing\u201d or \u201cweighing\u201d but those concepts seem implicit in the wording of the subsection: the requirements for \u201crailway operations and services\u201d on the one hand and the \u201cinterests of the localities\u201d on the other hand are juxtaposed against each other, implying that they should be weighed or balanced. Without doubt, the Act does not preclude weighing or balancing under subsection 98(2). Indeed, it is hard to conceive how the Agency could balance the subsection 98(2) considerations without actually assessing the weight or force of the considerations; balancing and weighing are not mutually exclusive or antithetical concepts.\n[20] A fair, holistic reading of the Agency\u2019s reasons shows that it did weigh and balance these subsection 98(2) considerations, just as the subsection seems to require it to do. At one point in its reasons (para. 242), the Agency was quite explicit on the point, stating that it \u201chas a broad discretion to decide what weight to give the evidence of a given interest of a locality\u201d when it is \u201cbalancing that interest against the requirements for railway operations and services\u201d.\nD. Adequacy of reasons [21] The appellants submit that the Agency\u2019s reasons are insufficient. I disagree.\n[22] In the case of statutory appeals from administrative decision-makers, do we apply the legal standard to evaluate first-instance courts\u2019 reasons in cases like R. v. Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869? Or must we consider some or all of the Supreme Court\u2019s observations in Vavilov on the adequacy of administrative decision-makers\u2019 reasons when they are assessed under reasonableness review? I note that there is some overlap between the two. Both require the reviewing court to read reasons functionally and contextually in light of the record as a whole, including the evidence adduced and the key submissions made.\n[23] This last point is key and it is often overlooked by those seeking to overturn a decision. All decision-makers, particularly administrative decision-makers to whom the legislature has assigned a decision-making task for reasons of efficiency and expedition, aim to synthesize their reasons down to the essential factors that led them to decide the way they did. They are not to create an encyclopedic account of all of the evidence and all of the parties\u2019 positions, as if their task is to report in detail everything that happened during the numerous days of the hearing. Instead, they are to distill and synthesize, ensuring that the parties, reviewing courts and the public observing the matter can discern where the administrative decision-maker was coming from and why it decided the way it did.\n[24] In words equally apposite to the review of administrative decisions, this Court has stressed the \u201crealities about the craft of writing reasons\u201d and has described it as an \u201cimprecise art suffused by difficult judgment calls that cannot be easily second-guessed\u201d: Mahjoub v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FCA 157, [2018] 2 F.C.R. 344 at para. 69. Again, in words worthy of note in the context of administrative decision-making, this Court described the plight faced by judges with writing reasons in a technical hearing that has lasted for weeks on end:\nImmersed from day-to-day and week-to-week in a long and complex trial such as this, trial judges occupy a privileged and unique position. Armed with the tools of logic and reason, they study and observe all of the witnesses and the exhibits. Over time, factual assessments develop, evolve, and ultimately solidify into a factual narrative, full of complex interconnections, nuances and flavour.\nWhen it comes time to draft reasons in a complex case, trial judges are not trying to draft an encyclopedia memorializing every last morsel of factual minutiae, nor can they. They distill and synthesize masses of information, separating the wheat from the chaff and, in the end, expressing only the most important factual findings and justifications for them.\nSometimes appellants attack as palpable and overriding error the non-mention or scanty mention of matters they consider to be important. In assessing this, care must be taken to distinguish true palpable and overriding error on the one hand, from the legitimate by-product of distillation and synthesis or innocent inadequacies of expression on the other.\n(Canada v. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 FCA 165, 431 N.R. 286 at paras. 49-51.) These observations are particularly apt in a case like this with a voluminous, complex and sprawling record speaking to a diverse array of interests, where the governing standard is whether the placement of the railway lines is \u201creasonable\u201d, a somewhat subjective standard elusive of precise definition.\n[25] Here, in my view, under any legal standard, the Agency\u2019s detailed and comprehensive reasons\u2014446 often heavily detailed paragraphs stretching over 100 pages, as well as an appendix\u2014are adequate. In particular, the Agency found that the concerns of the appellants, particularly the appellant municipalities, had been or would be addressed through mitigation by the appellant municipalities themselves or were not specific to the location of the railway line. The Agency agreed with the prior joint hearing panel that the project\u2019s direct effects were small and those effects were likely to occur regardless of whether CN\u2019s project proceeds.\n[26] One measure of adequacy is whether the parties were able to articulate to this Court why, in their view, the Agency\u2019s evaluation of whether or not the location of the railway lines was \u201creasonable\u201d should be sustained or quashed on appeal. On that measure, the Agency\u2019s reasons pass muster. Both sides knew where the Agency was coming from on all issues and argued their cases without difficulty.\n[27] Finally, and perhaps most importantly, in evaluating the adequacy of the Agency\u2019s reasons, one must consider what exactly the Agency was deciding.\n[28] Some cases decided by some administrative decision-makers, by virtue of the relative concreteness and objective nature of the factors to be considered, can be written up in a very precise, concrete, objective way. Here, one might think of an adjudicative decision-maker that merely has to find the exact facts, identify the correct law, and apply the law to the facts.\n[29] But other cases involve the subjective task of balancing conflicting, often qualitatively imprecise factors against a vague standard, such as \u201creasonableness\u201d or \u201cin the public interest\u201d. The conclusion rests more upon the overall impression of the administrative decision-maker, sometimes an impression more subjective than objective or mathematical, one that beggars precise description.\n[30] In this case, the Agency had to be satisfied that, in the language of subsection 98(2), \u201cthe location of the railway line is reasonable, taking into consideration requirements for railway operations and services and the interests of the localities that will be affected by the line\u201d. On the facts of this case, the \u201cinterests of the localities\u201d included interests relating to municipal revenues, air quality and noise, land use planning, requirements for railway operations and services, and mitigation of effects. The evidence on each of these was massive and sometimes complex.\n[31] The Agency\u2019s task under subsection 98(2) is not one that can be conducted with scientific or mathematical precision. This is not a case where the various detrimental effects of the railway line and the requirements for \u201crailway operations and services\u201d can be assigned a precise value and can be weighed against each other with exactitude in order to determine whether the location of the railway line is \u201creasonable\u201d. Rather, the Agency is in the realm of well-informed impressions that are difficult to describe with exactitude.\n[32] On some issues, all that can be expected in the reasons in a case like this is a description of the main concerns presented by the parties, an articulation of observations informed by the evidence, some comment on the key evidence adduced, some observations relevant to the balancing required under subsection 98(2), and a conclusion that leaves neither this Court nor the parties wondering why the Agency decided the way it did on the key, contested issues.\n[33] Overall, the Agency\u2019s reasons do just that. They are adequate.\nE. Procedural fairness [34] The appellants submit that the Agency was procedurally unfair in two respects: (1) it did not entertain submissions concerning the possible impact of a planned merger between CN and an American railway company; and (2) it denied the appellants the opportunity to adduce more evidence.\n[35] The planned merger involving CN never went through. Therefore, even assuming that the Agency\u2019s failure to entertain submissions on it was a reviewable error\u2014under whatever standard of review, if any, applies\u2014the procedural error did not affect the appellants\u2019 rights, as any error would now be moot. In such circumstances, relief cannot be granted: Mobil Oil Canada Ltd. v. Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 202, 111 D.L.R. (4th) 1 at 224 S.C.R.\n[36] On the issue of further evidence, some background is needed. CN\u2019s project was subject to a federal environmental assessment. It also needed the Agency\u2019s approval under subsection 98(2) of the Act. A joint review hearing panel was established for both purposes. It told the parties that this was a \u201csingle window process\u201d: the parties had to offer all of their evidence for both purposes in this single, combined hearing. The joint panel received or had access to thousands of pages of evidence filed over several years.\n[37] At the end of the joint panel\u2019s hearing, a very lengthy one, it announced\u2014consistent with everyone\u2019s understanding\u2014that the evidentiary record was closed. The appellants did not object.\n[38] In the circumstances, the lack of objection constituted waiver or lack of timely objection. This prevents the appellants from raising this alleged procedural error in this Court: Taseko Mines Limited v. Canada (Environment), 2019 FCA 320, 66 Admin. L.R. (6th) 1 at para. 47; Canadian National Railway Company v. Canada (Transportation Agency), 2021 FCA 173 at para. 68; Irving Shipbuilding Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2009 FCA 116, 314 D.L.R. (4th) 340 at para. 48; Algoma Tubes Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 89 at para. 19.\n[39] Somewhat later, after the joint panel\u2019s process, when the parties were before the Agency, the appellant municipalities requested the opportunity to file more evidence. The Agency rejected the request based on the \u201cthorough and lengthy submission and evidence-gathering process\u201d pursued by the joint panel, a process that was meant to be the only forum for the introduction and testing of evidence. As the Agency noted in its reasons (at para. 76), Halton had \u201cfully participated in the Review Panel process\u201d and provided extensive evidence and submissions, both before and at the public hearing.\n[40] The appellant municipalities applied for reconsideration of that decision. In response, the Agency permitted further written submissions from the parties on matters that arose after the earlier hearing had ended.\n[41] Given these facts, the appellants submit that the Agency\u2019s decision at a late stage of the process to stop the introduction of further evidence was procedurally unfair. The appellants have not persuaded me of this. In any event, the appellants have not identified with particularity the evidence they say they would have adduced, nor have they shown that it would have had any possible effect on the Agency\u2019s findings. And the Agency was entitled at some point to close the evidentiary record so it could deliberate and decide.\n[42] Halton also submits that it was denied procedural fairness because the Agency declined to order further production from CN. But, as the Agency notes (at para. 10), through the multi-year joint panel review process, CN had responded to hundreds of \u201cextensive, detailed and comprehensive\u201d information requests and answered further questions and undertakings at the hearing. I am satisfied that Halton had more than enough production to participate fully and fairly before the Agency.\n[43] Halton also raises other matters such as the granting of a one-day extension to CN to file a five-page surreply and an error on the part of CN in not copying the appellants on a letter to the Agency (later fixed). These procedural decisions are minor, do not constitute material procedural defects, and do not vitiate the Agency\u2019s decision.\n[44] Noting a number of its procedural concerns, Halton suggests that the Agency\u2019s mind was closed. This suggestion, equivalent to an allegation of bias, is most serious. The party raising bias must show \u201ca real likelihood or probability of bias\u201d, not just a \u201cmere suspicion\u201d. It must also offer \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201ccogent evidence\u201d in support of it. See R. v. S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484, 151 D.L.R. (4th) 193 at paras. 112, 117; Yukon Francophone School Board, Education Area #23 v. Yukon (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 25, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 282 at paras. 25-26. The bias allegation here falls well short of the mark. At most, the Agency merely disagreed with Halton\u2019s procedural arguments and such disagreement does not give rise to bias: Samson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 212 at para. 4; Bergey v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FCA 30 at para. 65.\n[45] The overall test for procedural fairness in a case such as this is whether, considering the context, the parties knew the case to meet and had a full and fair chance to respond: Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69, [2019] 1 F.C.R. 121 at para. 56. Further, procedural rights must be balanced against the public interest in effective, expeditious and efficient decision-making. Those are judge-made tests. But, absent constitutional concern, and there is none here, it is open to legislators to pass legislation expanding or restricting judge-made tests. Here the legislator has spoken and has supplied a legislative standard that we must keep front of mind when evaluating procedural fairness. The Agency must \u201cconduct all proceedings in a manner that is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the issues at stake and the relief claimed\u201d: Canadian Transportation Agency Rules (Dispute Proceedings and Certain Rules Applicable to All Proceedings), S.O.R.\/2014-104, s. 4. I conclude that the process followed by the Agency, which built upon the joint panel process, including the reasons it wrote, passes this test.\n[46] The appellants submit that the Agency\u2019s procedural rulings were evidence of a closed mind on the issues before it. Given the rejection of the appellants\u2019 procedural challenges above, this submission must also be rejected. The detailed nature of the Agency\u2019s reasons including their attentiveness to Halton\u2019s arguments and the Agency\u2019s willingness to receive additional submissions from the parties on multiple occasions belie any suggestion that the Agency was actually or apparently biased or that its mind was closed.\n[47] At any time during the course of the proceeding, if the appellants felt that the Agency was not acting in an impartial manner, they could have registered a timely objection. They did not. Thus, they cannot raise the objection in this Court.\nF. Other issues [48] Finally, at various places in their memorandum of fact and law and in their oral submissions, the appellants challenge how the Agency dealt with issues such as municipal revenues, air quality, land use planning, the requirements for railway operations and services, and the mitigation of effects\u2014in other words, how the Agency applied legal standards to the evidence before it.\n[49] In this appeal under subsection 41(1) of the Act, we cannot consider submissions on questions of mixed fact and law. A number of the points the appellants raise are factually suffused questions of mixed fact and law or questions of fact. In this regard, I adopt CN\u2019s submissions in its memorandum of fact and law at paragraphs 66-78 and 81-82. For example:\nMunicipal revenues. The appellants submit that the Agency did not consider municipal revenues as an interest of the locality. I disagree. As the respondents suggest, the Agency (at paras. 408-413) considered municipal revenues but simply provided them less weight than the appellants would have liked.\nAir quality. The appellants submit that the Agency contradicted itself by saying that it could consider environmental effects, but later saying that it could not. I disagree. Instead, I agree with the respondents that no contradiction exists. The Agency reasonably concluded (at paras. 247-250) that to the extent an environmental effect was to be considered by another administrative decision-maker under other legislation, the Agency should not duplicate that jurisdiction unless it was part of its jurisdiction under subsection 98(2) of the Act. After all, according to the Agency, it was not empowered to conduct a second environmental assessment and \u201c[e]nvironmental assessments and rail construction authorizations are two different regulatory authorizations decided under two different statutory regimes\u201d (at para. 247). The Agency reasonably went on to review the environmental assessment report of the review panel and the Minister\u2019s Decision statement as part of its task of determining whether an interest of the locality was affected by the railroad line (at paras. 248-250).\nLand use planning. The appellants argue that the Agency erred in law by finding (at paras. 390-391) that planning personnel had sufficient time to adapt to the terminal and the project is isolated from any residential development. I disagree. Instead, I agree with the respondents that these criticisms are directed toward factually suffused findings of mixed fact and law or findings of fact, matters that this Court has no jurisdiction to decide.\nRailway operations and services. The appellants argue that the Agency erred in law by ignoring whether it would be more efficient to use the existing terminal rather than to conduct the new project. I disagree. Instead, I agree with the respondents that the Agency considered this issue (at paras. 329-332). Once again, this was a factually suffused issue of mixed fact and law, an issue on which we cannot interfere.\nMitigation. The appellants argue that the environmental effects, particularly air quality, are \u201cimmitigable\u201d. This goes to the merits of what the Agency decided, on which we cannot interfere. It is not a question of law or legal principle. Instead, I agree with the respondents that the term \u201cimmitigable\u201d is irrelevant to this limited-scope, but nevertheless important, appeal.\n[50] At other times during oral argument, perhaps out of understandable enthusiasm, the appellants seemed to exhort us to interfere on behalf of the residents of Halton to prevent them from suffering ill-effects from CN\u2019s planned facility. However, under this legislative regime passed by our democratically elected government, the assessment of those ill-effects is for the Agency, not us. We would be acting contrary to law if we were to wade in and make our own assessment. Our task is limited to reversing the Agency\u2019s decision for legal error or procedural unfairness. Here, we see no legal error and no procedural unfairness.\n[51] I thank all counsel for excellent and helpful submissions made in the best interests of their clients.\nG.

Introduction [1] The appellant, Mr. Zoghbi, made a complaint against Air Canada under the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, and sought, among other things, financial relief.\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Commission screened out the appellant\u2019s complaint on the ground that financial relief was not available owing to an international convention incorporated into Canadian domestic law. In the words of the Canadian Human Rights Act, s. 41(1)(d), it was plain and obvious that the complaint was \u201ctrivial\u201d.\n[3] The appellant applied to the Federal Court to quash the Commission\u2019s decision. The Federal Court (per Fothergill J.) granted the application in part, finding that while financial compensation was not available, the appellant might have been entitled to other remedies: 2021 FC 1154.\n[4] The Federal Court sent the matter back to the Commission with instructions to consider whether these other remedies were available and whether there were other grounds to screen out the complaint. Two other grounds were possible: the appellant had signed a release as part of a settlement and the appellant\u2019s complaint might be better decided by the Canadian Transportation Agency.\n[5] Disappointed by the fact that most of his complaint was taken off the table, the appellant appeals to this Court. The main target of his appeal is the international convention and whether it barred his claim for financial relief. On that, I find that the appellant\u2019s submissions have no merit: it was reasonable for the Commission to find that the international convention applies by virtue of the law incorporating it into Canadian domestic law and does bar his claim for monetary compensation.\n[6] However, the appellant\u2019s complaint alleged that the law incorporating the international convention into Canadian domestic law violated his equality rights under section 15 of the Charter. The Commission has never considered that issue. Accordingly, the Commission must also consider that issue in the redetermination ordered by the Federal Court, along with the two other grounds. As a result, in order to give effect to that, I would allow the appeal in part.\nB. The basic facts (1) The incident giving rise to the complaint [7] The appellant is a Lebanese-born Canadian citizen. He alleges that his race, ethnic origin and colour were identifiable to strangers through his name, appearance, accent and his use of Arabic. He booked a flight on Air Canada to travel from Halifax to London.\n[8] On the plane, while speaking on the phone in Arabic, the appellant placed his jacket on the seat next to him. A flight attendant told him to remove his jacket. Annoyed at the flight attendant\u2019s tone, he expressed his displeasure\u2014he concedes he might have done this a little harshly\u2014and he asked to speak to a manager.\n[9] Soon afterward, an Air Canada agent asked the appellant to come out onto the jet-bridge for a discussion. The agent then informed the appellant that Air Canada was banning him from the flight. According to a report prepared by Air Canada, the appellant was \u201cverbally abusive toward a flight attendant and gate staff\u201d. Reacting to the report, Air Canada did more. It imposed a general travel ban on the appellant.\n(2) The complaint [10] The appellant filed a complaint with the Commission alleging discrimination by Air Canada on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, and\/or religion, all recognized grounds under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Among other things, the appellant sought monetary compensation.\n(3) The general legal framework concerning international travel [11] A Canadian statute, the Carriage by Air Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-26, incorporates the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, 2242 UNTS 309 [Montreal Convention] into Canadian law: see s. 2(2.1).\n[12] The Montreal Convention sets out exclusive rules on when and to what extent an airline is liable for incidents during international air travel. It bars monetary damages for incidents during international air travel, including, as here, embarkation. Article 17 allows only for monetary compensation in cases of \u201cdeath or bodily injury of a passenger\u201d where \u201cthe accident took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking\u201d. And article 29 of the Montreal Convention provides that \u201cpunitive, exemplary or any other non-compensatory damages shall not be recoverable\u201d.\n[13] Throughout these proceedings, Air Canada has contended that the Carriage by Air Act bars the appellant\u2019s claim for financial compensation owing to a human rights violation.\n(4) Proceedings before the Commission [14] Soon after the appellant filed his complaint, the Commission informed him that it was going to screen his complaint under ss. 40 and 41 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Due to the Carriage by Air Act, the Commission was concerned that it would not have jurisdiction to give him financial compensation. After receiving submissions on point, the Commission found that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to award damages. It screened out the entire complaint.\n[15] Having screened out the entire complaint, the Commission did not need to consider the issue of the release or whether the Canadian Transportation Agency would be better suited to handle the appellant\u2019s complaint.\n[16] The Commission\u2019s investigator acknowledged the appellant\u2019s equality rights claim under the Charter but never dealt with it. The appellant phrased the equality rights claim as follows:\nAlternatively, if the Montreal Convention did apply and if it did limit [the appellant\u2019s] rights under the Canadian Human Rights Act, then the Carriage by Air Act implementing the Convention violates s. 15 of the Charter, and as such should be \u201cread down\u201d.\n[17] In deciding to screen out the appellant\u2019s complaint, the Commission never dealt with his claim that the Carriage by Air Act implementing the Montreal Convention violated his equality rights under section 15 of the Charter.\n(5) Proceedings before the Federal Court [18] The Federal Court conducted reasonableness review of the Commission\u2019s decision. In doing so, it rejected the appellant\u2019s submission that it should conduct correctness review.\n[19] The Federal Court found the Commission\u2019s analysis and conclusions concerning the Montreal Convention and its incorporation into Canadian domestic law by the Carriage by Air Act to be reasonable.\n[20] However, as mentioned above, the Federal Court found (at paras. 46 and 52) that the appellant might be entitled to other human rights remedies not barred by the Montreal Convention and the Carriage by Air Act. For example, Air Canada might be subject to an order to take \u201cmeasures to redress the alleged discriminatory practice or prevent similar practices from occurring in future\u201d (at para. 52), for example by training its staff to handle circumstances such as this in a more rights-friendly way. It returned the matter to the Commission to decide these issues.\n[21] In the Federal Court, the appellant litigated his equality rights claim under the Charter. The Federal Court declined to deal with it on the ground that insufficient evidence was offered on key aspects of the claim.\n[22] The Federal Court also found that it was unnecessary to decide the appellant\u2019s equality rights claim in order to determine the application for judicial review. As a result of that finding and the Commission\u2019s failure to deal with the appellant\u2019s equality rights claim, that claim has never been considered on its merits. It has just fallen through the cracks.\n(6) Proceedings before this Court [23] In this Court, the appellant raises all of the issues that he raised before the Federal Court. He has subdivided his arguments into many parts. I prefer to group his submissions into six broad questions. Merely for clarity of description of the issues, I phrase the questions as if this were a case of correctness review but, as we shall see, the standard of review is reasonableness.\n[24] Here are the questions:\n(1)What is the standard of review?\n(2)Did the Commission have jurisdiction or reasonably find that it has jurisdiction to interpret the Montreal Convention and the Carriage by Air Act?\n(3)As a matter of interpretation, did the Montreal Convention and the Carriage by Air Act bar the appellant\u2019s human rights claim?\n(4)Should the Commission have taken into account article 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Can.TS 1970, No. 28?\n(5)Does the Canadian Human Rights Act prevail over the Carriage by Air Act?\n(6)Does the Carriage by Air Act infringe equality rights under section 15 of the Charter?\n[25] Issues (4) and (5) were not raised before the Commission even though they could reasonably have been. This is especially so, as the complainant was represented by Dr. G\u00e1bor Luk\u00e1cs, a frequent litigant in the Federal Courts system and a person well-versed in legal matters. In fact, Dr. Luk\u00e1cs argued many legal issues before the Commission but he chose not to raise issues (4) and (5).\n[26] The appellant now raises issues (4) and (5) for the first time on judicial review. Issues raised for the first time before a reviewing court should not be entertained: Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. Alberta Teachers\u2019 Association, 2011 SCC 61, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 654 at paras. 22-23.\n[27] The rationale behind this\u2014a sound one\u2014is that the legislation governing an administrative regime gives the administrative decision-maker, not reviewing courts, the power to decide all of the issues going to the merits of cases. Although recently the Supreme Court has sometimes decided new issues going to the merits of cases (see, e.g., Mason v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 21, 485 D.L.R. (4th) 583), this should be seen as a one-off situation where it considered, rightly or wrongly, the question before it to be clear, not a displacement of the longstanding, unquestionably sound position set out in Alberta Teachers: Klos v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 205 at para. 8; Terra Reproductions Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 214 at para. 6; see also P. Daly, \u201cThe Signal and the Noise in Administrative Law\u201d (2017) 68 University of New Brunswick Law Journal 68-86.\n[28] Nevertheless, in the end, to give the appellant the fullest answer to his grounds of appeal, I will deal with issues (4) and (5) and show that his position has no merit anyway.\n[29] Issue (6) was raised before the Commission but, as mentioned above, the Commission never dealt with it. The Federal Court dealt with it on its merits. On the authority of Alberta Teachers, it should not have done so: see paragraphs 26-27, above, in these reasons.\n[30] The fact that issue (6) is a constitutional issue does not change the situation. Where the issue is one of constitutional law and the administrative decision-maker has the jurisdiction to deal with it, the administrative decision-maker, as the merits-decider, is the forum to raise it. In those circumstances, an applicant on judicial review cannot bypass the power of a tribunal to decide an issue, and proceed directly to the reviewing court: Okwuobi v. Lester B. Pearson School Board; Casimir v. Quebec (Attorney General); Zorrilla v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 16, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 257 at paras. 28-55.\n[31] Where, as here, the administrative decision-maker failed to deal with a constitutional issue placed before it and an applicant submits that the administrative decision-maker had jurisdiction to decide it, an applicant should attack that failure and ask for the constitutional issue to be remitted back for redetermination. The Commission, not a reviewing court, has the power to consider whether it has jurisdiction to assess the constitutional issue and, if so, whether the constitutional issue, along with any other issues, should be sent to the Tribunal for adjudication. As we shall see, whether it has jurisdiction to assess the constitutional issue turns on the test in Nova Scotia (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) v. Martin; Nova Scotia (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) v. Laseur, 2003 SCC 54, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 504, discussed below.\n[32] In light of this, and in light of the fact that the Commission\u2014the proper forum to determine issue (6)\u2014will be dealing with it in its upcoming redetermination, I decline to say more about this issue.\nC. Analysis (1) What is the standard of review? [33] The Federal Court (at paras. 25-29) selected reasonableness as the standard of review. It noted that screening decisions of the Commission under s. 41 of the Canadian Human Rights Act are \u201cordinarily subject to review by this Court against the standard of reasonableness\u201d (at para. 25). It added that none of the exceptions to reasonableness review applied.\n[34] I agree with the Federal Court for the reasons it gave. I adopt its reasons as my own.\n[35] The appellant submits that the Commission\u2019s decision should be reviewed on the basis of correctness because there is a fundamental issue whether the Commission has the jurisdiction to consider questions of law. But whether an administrative decision-maker has such jurisdiction is not a recognized ground for correctness review. Rather, jurisdiction\u2014whether an administrative decision-maker has the power under its legislation to do something\u2014is really a question of legislative interpretation, a matter for which the standard of review is reasonableness: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653 at para. 115.\n[36] The appellant also submits that the interpretation and application of the Carriage by Air Act is a general question of law of central importance to the legal system. Such questions are reviewable for correctness. But here we are not dealing with such a question.\n[37] The interpretation and application of a statute, here the Carriage by Air Act, has significance to those who fly internationally who later wish to assert a claim for damages, but it has no broader ramifications beyond that. It is not the sort of question, such as a quasi-constitutional question that arises in multiple contexts or a question with constitutional ramifications, that requires, for rule of law reasons, a single correct response: Mouvement la\u00efque qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois v. Saguenay (City), 2015 SCC 16, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 3, (the state\u2019s duty of religious neutrality); Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. University of Calgary, 2016 SCC 53, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 555, (the limits to legal professional privilege, an interest under section 8 of the Charter); Chagnon v. Syndicat de la fonction publique et parapublique du Qu\u00e9bec, 2018 SCC 39, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 687 (the scope of Parliamentary privilege, a constitutional principle).\n[38] The appellant submits that lurking behind the interpretation of the Carriage by Air Act is the Montreal Convention and its interpretation is a matter of general importance. He submits that treaties, which apply to many different contexts, should receive only one uniform interpretation. As we shall see, the interpretation of the Montreal Convention in the context of this case is perfectly clear. Regardless of the standard of review, the Montreal Convention bars the appellant\u2019s damages claim against Air Canada in this case.\n[39] No doubt, an alleged human rights infringement by a private party in these circumstances is very important to the appellant. No doubt, human rights are important, are sometimes controversial and are of wider public concern. But importance to the parties before the Court and important issues in themselves do not trigger this exception giving rise to correctness review: see Vavilov at paras. 58-62. I agree with the respondent who notes that the question before us is specific to the Canadian Human Rights Act\u2019s administrative regime for the protection of human rights and only concerning one of its available remedies and only in the context of passengers travelling internationally by air.\n[40] Therefore, the Federal Court properly selected the standard of review of reasonableness.\n(2) Did the Commission have jurisdiction or reasonably find that it has jurisdiction to interpret the Montreal Convention and the Carriage by Air Act? [41] The appellant submits that the Commission cannot determine questions of law beyond its enabling statute. Instead, it is limited to assessing the sufficiency of the evidence before it. It cites Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 854, 140 D.L.R. (4th) 193 at para. 53.\n[42] On this issue, the Federal Court held (at paras. 30-39) that the Commission was not so limited. I agree with the Federal Court, for the reasons it gave. In this regard I also substantially agree with the submissions of the Commission, which intervened on this issue.\n[43] As the Federal Court noted, the Supreme Court revisited Cooper in Martin, above, and, substantially overturned it. Martin stands for the proposition that if an administrative decision-maker has the authority to decide questions of law, either expressly or implicitly as a matter of legislative interpretation, it can deal with legal questions before it. As Martin suggests, this includes issues of constitutional law.\n[44] In Martin, the Supreme Court stated that its particular holding in Cooper\u2014that the Commission had no implicit or explicit authority to decide questions of law under a now-repealed provision of the Canadian Human Rights Act (s. 15(c))\u2014remained valid. But it continued by stating that \u201c[t]o the extent that [Cooper] is incompatible with [Martin]\u2026the ratio of the majority judgment in Cooper is no longer good law\u201d (at para. 47).\n[45] In Cooper, the Supreme Court attached significance to whether the question of law was general and limited or whether the administrative decision-maker was adjudicative, rather than just performing a screening function. In light of Martin, that is no longer the law. In Martin (at para. 47), the Supreme Court specifically ruled that adjudicative nature of the administrative decision-maker counts for very little. The clear implication is that screening bodies, such as the Commission, do have the power to consider questions of law necessary to fulfil their screening function.\n[46] The notion of implicit jurisdiction or jurisdiction as a matter of legislative interpretation in Martin deserves closer examination. At paragraph 41, the Supreme Court in Martin observes that heed must be paid to, among other things, the \u201cstatutory mandate of the tribunal\u201d, \u201cwhether deciding questions of law is necessary to fulfilling this mandate effectively\u201d, and whether \u201cdepriving the tribunal of the power to decide questions of law would impair its capacity to fulfill its intended mandate\u201d. This is not unlike the identification of the implicit powers of tribunals the Supreme Court usefully explored in Chrysler Canada Ltd. v. Canada (Competition Tribunal), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 394, 92 D.L.R. (4th) 609.\n[47] In this case, the Commission\u2019s function under the Canadian Human Rights Act is to act as a screening body, to winnow out complaints that cannot possibly succeed on the facts or the law. A complaint that cannot possibly succeed on the facts or the law should not be sent to the Tribunal for a time-consuming, resource intensive hearing. The purpose of this is to ensure the wise use of resources and the efficient disposition of complaints. To find that the Commission cannot look at whether some law makes a complaint doomed to fail is to frustrate that statutory purpose.\n[48] For good measure, this Court has thrice decided that the Commission, when conducting its screening function, has a large amount of latitude, including the ability to measure a complaint against applicable law to see whether it can potentially succeed: Canada (Attorney General) v. Ennis, 2021 FCA 95, [2021] 4 F.C.R. 154 at para. 61; Gregg v. Air Canada Pilots Association, 2019 FCA 218 (dissenting reasons but not opposed by the majority on this point); Bell Canada v. Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada, [1999] 1 F.C. 113, 167 D.L.R. (4th) 432 (C.A.) at para. 38; see also Northcott v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FC 289. On other occasions, it has had to decide whether other administrative decision-makers should handle a complaint, which requires it to examine and interpret the governing statutes of those administrators: Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid, 2005 SCC 30, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 667 at para. 99; Eadie v. MTS Inc. 2015 FCA 173, 475 N.R. 174 at paras. 96-105; MacFarlane v. Day & Ross Inc., 2010 FC 556, [2011] 4 F.C.R. 117 at paras. 73-74.\n[49] In this case, the Commission determined whether remedies were legally available for the alleged breach of the appellant\u2019s human rights in light of the Carriage by Air Act and the Montreal Convention. It did not adjudicate the merits of the appellant\u2019s complaint but rather assessed whether the complaint should be dealt with using objective benchmarks including relevant law and precedent. It concluded that this task fell within the powers, duties and functions conferred upon it by s. 41 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[50] The Federal Court held that the Commission\u2019s conclusion was reasonable. I agree for the foregoing reasons and the reasons the Federal Court gave.\n(3) As a matter of interpretation, did the Montreal Convention and the Carriage by Air Act bar the appellant\u2019s human rights claim?\n[51] The Commission answered this in the affirmative. In doing so, it acted reasonably.\n[52] In its reasons, the Commission adopted paragraphs 60-68 of the investigation report. The report began (at para. 60) by reviewing the Montreal Convention and the Carriage by Air Act. It noted, as mentioned above, that article 17 of the Montreal Convention allows only for monetary compensation in cases of \u201cdeath or bodily injury of a passenger\u201d where \u201cthe accident\u2026took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking\u201d.\n[53] However, the report did not leap to the conclusion that the appellant\u2019s claim was excluded. It asked itself whether there was any room under the Montreal Convention for claims based on \u201cfundamental, quasi-constitutional rights\u201d (at para. 62).\n[54] Here, it found (at para. 62) that the Supreme Court had already decided that issue: Thibodeau v. Air Canada, 2014 SCC 67, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 340. The Supreme Court found that damages for breaches on aircraft of language rights\u2014fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights\u2014could not be claimed because of the Warsaw Convention, the predecessor to the Montreal Convention.\n[55] The report went further (at paras. 64-65) and examined the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in support of that conclusion. The Supreme Court had examined a case where a couple alleged that they were bumped from a flight because of their race: King v. American Airlines, Inc., 284 F.3d 352 (2d Cir. 2002). In that case, like here, the couple enjoyed statutory human rights protections against racial discrimination. Sotomayor J. (as she then was) concluded that the claim was caught by the Warsaw Convention which, like the Montreal Convention, exhaustively covers claims for injuries suffered while \u201cin the course of [one of] the operations of embarking\u201d: Thibodeau at para. 68. The Supreme Court agreed with the analysis in King: Thibodeau at paras. 67-73.\n[56] On the authority of Thibodeau, King (adopted by the Supreme Court) and the specific wording of the Montreal Convention and the Carriage by Air Act, the report concluded that the appellant\u2019s human rights damages claim was barred.\n[57] The Commission\u2019s decision to adopt this part of the report and its reasoning is reasonable. The outcome is fully consistent with an authoritative decision of the Supreme Court and the meaning of the Montreal Convention and the Carriage by Air Act. As well, there is a clear, sufficiently articulated chain of reasoning leading from the facts of the case to the outcome.\n(4) Should the Commission have taken into account article 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination? [58] The appellant submits that the Commission should have taken into account article 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination.\n[59] This submission fails. It was reasonable for the Commission not to take into account this Convention.\n[60] The appellant misunderstands how international law can be used when administrative decision-makers and courts decide domestic issues. This issue is now well-settled by a Supreme Court decision that binds administrative decision-makers and courts alike: Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. Entertainment Software Association, 2022 SCC 30, 471 D.L.R. (4th) 391 at paras. 43-48.\n[61] In the present case, Canadian domestic law has adopted into Canadian law an international convention, the Montreal Convention, with all of its limitations on damages liability in article 29. In cases such as this, we are to interpret and implement article 29: Office of the Children\u2019s Lawyer v. Balev, 2018 SCC 16, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 398.\n[62] The Montreal Convention, with its limitations on damages liability in article 29, which is now a part of Canadian domestic law, is clear and unequivocal. It does not leave open exceptions for possible liability, such as international law norms and principles, human rights claims or avenues for liability under other international instruments such as the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. Nor does the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, when read and understood, reveal some sort of ambiguity in article 29 of the Montreal Convention. The Montreal Convention is neither vague nor ambiguous. Nor is there any extrinsic material behind it that helps the appellant. The Montreal Convention slams the door shut. It does not leave even a crack in the door.\n[63] The appellant submits that article 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination requires Canada to provide a remedy of damages for racial discrimination in international aviation despite the Montreal Convention and its incorporation into Canadian domestic law by virtue of the Carriage by Air Act. But assuming the appellant is correct, this Court has no power to issue mandamus requiring Canada to legislate to fulfil that requirement. Nor can this Court use that supposed requirement\u2014not part of domestic law\u2014to somehow amend the clear language of the Carriage by Air Act and the Montreal Convention.\n(5) Does the Canadian Human Rights Act prevail over the Carriage by Air Act? [64] As mentioned above, this is a new issue\u2014one that was not raised before the Commission. But it can be dealt with in short order. As a matter of statutory interpretation, the Carriage by Air Act and article 29 of the Montreal Convention are clear and unambiguous. They prohibit all damages claims however asserted. The appellant has offered nothing in terms of text, context or purpose to suggest that somehow the Carriage by Air Act and article 29 of the Montreal Convention, despite their clear language, allow for damages claims arising from domestic human rights statutes. As well, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Thibodeau is dispositive. Just as the language rights legislation in that case did not prevail over the Montreal Convention, the same must be true here: see paragraphs 54-57, above.\n(6) Does the Carriage by Air Act infringe equality rights under section 15 of the Charter? [65] As mentioned above (at paragraph 16), this was part of the appellant\u2019s complaint. The Commission has never dealt with it. To complete its task on this application, the Commission needs to examine whether, on the facts pleaded and the submissions made, it has jurisdiction to consider this issue and, if so, whether it is plain and obvious that the section 15 Charter challenge is \u201ctrivial\u201d under s. 41 of the Act\u2014in other words, whether it has any chance of success.\n[66] In its reasons (at para. 64), the Federal Court required the Commission to give the parties a further opportunity to adduce evidence and arguments on the issue it remitted back to the Commission. That opportunity should extend to this issue as well.\nD. The recent motion [67] Recently, the appellant has moved for an order directing the issuance of a subpoena to the Commission to produce certain documents before it in another case involving Air Canada and an order permitting it to file those documents into the record in this case. The appellant submits that this other case is substantially identical to the case at bar but the Commission decided not to screen the matter out. However, this case has been settled. It will not be tried by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.\n[68] Air Canada notes that the Commission\u2019s screening decision makes no mention of the Montreal Convention or the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. This is noteworthy, given that Air Canada told the Commission that the complainant would not be able to recover damages due to the Montreal Convention.\n[69] Rather, the Commission appears to have decided the case solely on the credibility of the particular witnesses before it. Perhaps the Commission felt, as the Federal Court felt here, that the Tribunal could award remedies other than monetary damages. It did not say.\n[70] As a result, the documents the appellant seeks to introduce do not seem to be of any probative value in the case before us.\n[71] As well, taking matters at their highest, even if the Commission said something supportive of the appellant\u2019s case\u2014and from a reading of the evidence filed on the motion, I am not satisfied it did\u2014it is well-established that different adjudicators can reach different results on substantially similar facts and they can all be reasonable: Wilson v. Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., 2016 SCC 29, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 770 at para. 17.\n[72] Further, the fact that a second decision reached a different result from the first, even on substantially similar facts, does not prove anything. The second decision may be unreasonable. Our focus is whether the Commission\u2019s decision before us is unreasonable. I have concluded that it is reasonable. As a result, I am not satisfied that the appellant has met the test for new evidence and, in particular, the requirement that the evidence be capable of changing the result of the case: Barendregt v. Grebliunas, 2022 SCC 22, 469 D.L.R. (4th) 1; Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, 106 D.L.R. (3d) 212.\n[73] The appellant infers from the fact that this other matter was referred to the Tribunal, that the Commission must have concluded that it has no power to determine questions of law beyond its enabling statute generally. That is pure speculation. If it did so decide, its decision is liable to be found to be unreasonable based on the analysis of Cooper and Martin and subsequent cases, above.\n[74] Finally, I query whether the appellant has satisfied the requirements for the issuance of a subpoena on a judicial review, let alone an appeal: Tsleil Waututh Nation v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FCA 128 at para. 103.\n[75] In any event, regardless of what the Commission might have done in some other case, the legal analysis set out above does not change. The decision of the Commission in this case is reasonable.\nE. Air Canada\u2019s preliminary objection [76] Air Canada submits that the appellant won in the Federal Court and it is really just appealing the Federal Court\u2019s reasons. It submits, correctly, that appeals from the Federal Court lie only against the Federal Court\u2019s judgments, not its reasons: Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, s. 27(1); Ratiopharm Inc. v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 FCA 261, 60 C.P.R. (4th) 165 at para. 6; Fournier v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 265 at para. 28.\n[77] Air Canada had moved on an interlocutory basis to quash the appeal but this Court, citing the high threshold for quashing an appeal, dismissed the motion without prejudice to Air Canada raising this issue again at the hearing of the appeal.\n[78] In my view, Air Canada\u2019s objection is without merit.\n[79] The Federal Court allowed the appellant\u2019s judicial review. But that was not unqualified. It remitted the matter back to the Commission \u201cfor redetermination in accordance with the [r]easons for [j]udgment\u201d. The reasons for judgment left the appellant with only a narrow issue for redetermination: the issue described in paragraph 4 above. Everything else sought by the appellant, arguably far more important to the appellant, was denied. The appellant has every right to appeal to this Court to set aside that denial.\nF. Proposed disposition [80] For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the motion with costs.\n[81] I would allow the appeal in part.

As such, it is required to comply with the provisions of the Canada Labour Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2, including the provisions of Part II of the Code that govern occupational health and safety in federally regulated workplaces. Of particular relevance to this application is subsection 134.1(1) of the Code, found in Part II, that requires CP to establish a Policy Health and Safety Committee (Committee) \u201c[f]or the purposes of addressing health and safety matters that apply to [CP\u2019s] work, undertaking or business\u201d.\n[2] Officials delegated by the Minister of Labour (Regulators) sought to attend a full-day meeting of the Committee to be held on March 10, 2020, at a CP worksite. CP responded by offering to allow the Regulators to attend only a portion of the meeting.\n[3] On March 10, 2020, after the Committee meeting was already underway, the Regulators issued a Direction pursuant to subsection 145(1) of the Code. The Direction expressed the Regulators\u2019 opinion that CP had contravened subsection 143(a) of the Code by obstructing officials delegated by the Minister of Labour from attending the full-day Committee meeting. The Direction ordered CP to immediately terminate the contravention and take steps to ensure that the contravention did not continue or recur.\n[4] CP appealed the Direction to the Canada Industrial Relations Board. It argued that the Direction was issued improperly because no underlying contravention of the Code supported the issuance of the Direction. As described in more detail below, CP submitted that the Code did not confer any power or duty upon the Minister to simply monitor the work of the Committee; hence, the enforcement powers of the Code were not available to the Regulators. CP also submitted that the Regulators failed to act in a procedurally fair manner before issuing the Direction.\n[5] After conducting a de novo hearing, the Board rejected CP\u2019s submissions and confirmed the Direction (2023 CIRB 1082). In the Board\u2019s view, the Regulators did not \u201cneed a reason to initiate an intervention\u201d (reasons, para. 58); the powers of the Regulators \u201cunder section 141(1)(a) of the Code do not rest on a precondition that there actually be a problem\u201d (reasons, para. 59). Paragraph 141(1)(a) of the Code confers broad powers upon the Regulators that include \u201cthe power to randomly attend at workplaces to perform inspections\u2026 to see how things are going \u2014 without having to articulate any suspicions as a precondition to doing the inspection\u201d (reasons, paragraph 59). It followed that, by denying the Regulators access to the Committee meeting, CP obstructed and prevented the Regulator from observing and inquiring into the operation of the Committee. The Board also rejected the argument that CP had been denied procedural fairness.\n[6] CP now brings this application for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. Its primary submission is that the Board\u2019s decision is unreasonable because the Board failed to consider whether subsection 141(1) of the Code, or any other provision, granted authority to the Regulators to attend the Committee meeting. CP also argues that the Direction was not issued in a procedurally fair manner.\n[7] The first issue for consideration therefore is whether the Board\u2019s decision is unreasonable.\n[8] The parties properly acknowledge that reasonableness review applies to the Board\u2019s conclusion that paragraph 141(1)(a) of the Code entitled the Regulator to attend the entire Policy Committee meeting.\n[9] Reasonableness review requires this Court to consider whether the Board\u2019s decision, \u201cincluding both the rationale for the decision and the outcome\u201d is unreasonable (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653 at para. 83 [Vavilov]). Important considerations include:\nan otherwise reasonable outcome is not reasonable if reached on an improper basis (Vavilov at para. 86);\n\u201can administrative decision-maker\u2019s interpretation of a statutory provision must be consistent with the text, context and purpose of the provision\u201d (Vavilov at para. 121); and\nthe reasons of an administrative decision-maker must \u201cmeaningfully account for,\u201d and \u201cmeaningfully grapple with,\u201d the central issues and concerns raised by the parties (Vavilov at paras. 127, 128).\n[10] Bearing these considerations in mind, I now turn to the first issue raised by CP before the Board, and the Board\u2019s consideration of the issue.\n[11] In its reasons, the Board acknowledged CP\u2019s argument \u201cthat the Direction is unlawful because the regulators did not have the authority to demand attendance at the Policy Committee meeting\u201d (reasons, para. 56). More specifically, CP argued that on its plain wording subsection 141(1) required that the Minister or her delegate exercise their powers while \u201ccarrying out the Minister\u2019s duties\u201d under the Code. The Regulators had confirmed to CP that they were not investigating a formal complaint; rather, they only wished to monitor the work of the Committee. CP argued that the Code did not confer any power or duty upon the Minister to monitor the work of the Committee. It followed that by seeking to monitor the work of the Committee, the Regulator was not \u201ccarrying out\u201d any duty conferred on the Minister, and the powers set out in subsection 141(1) were not engaged.\n[12] To respond to CP\u2019s argument, the Board considered the purpose of Part II of the Code, set out in section 122.1\u2014namely, to prevent workplace accidents and injuries. The Board said this purpose must guide its interpretation of the Code (reasons, paras. 50\u201351). This required that Part II be interpreted liberally.\n[13] The Board then considered subsection 141(1) of the Code and the powers assigned therein to the Minister\u2019s delegates. The Board observed that the Regulators were all ministerial delegates. As such, they were entitled to exercise the powers listed in subsection 141(1) of the Code (reasons, paras. 53\u201354).\n[14] Of particular significance to the Board was paragraph 141(1)(a) of the Code, which at the relevant time provided:\n141 (1) Subject to section 143.2, the Minister may, in carrying out the Minister\u2019s duties and at any reasonable time, enter any work place controlled by an employer and, in respect of any work place, may\n(a) conduct examinations, tests, inquiries, investigations and inspections or direct the employer to conduct them;\n[15] The Board did not specifically consider the text of subsection 141(1) in light of CP\u2019s argument that the powers conferred by the provision were not engaged by a request to attend and monitor a meeting of the Committee.\n[16] Instead, the Board referenced two prior decisions of the Occupational Health and Safety Tribunal of Canada: Canadian National Railway Company v. Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, 2013 OHSTC 29 [Teamsters], and Canadian National Railway Company v. United Steelworkers, 2020 OHSTC 6 [Steelworkers], quoting from both.\n[17] On the basis of this jurisprudence, the Board then concluded:\n[58] From the statutory language and the jurisprudence cited above, one can discern that the Minister and their representatives do not need a reason to initiate an intervention. If they do not need a reason, then it follows that they do not need to provide the parties with a specific reason for their intervention.\n[59] Consequently, the regulators were not obliged to declare any specific reason for wanting to attend the Policy Committee meeting. The powers of a ministerial delegate under section 141(1)(a) of the Code do not rest on a precondition that there actually be a problem. They have the power to randomly attend at workplaces to perform inspections under section 141(1) of the Code\u2014to see how things are going\u2014without having to articulate any suspicions as a precondition to doing the inspection (see Canadian National Railway Company v. United Steelworkers, supra).\n[18] While in an appropriate case, the Board may find assistance in past decisions to interpret the text of a provision in the Code, in this case the Board\u2019s reliance on these cases was misplaced because in neither case was the decision-maker required to consider the issue raised by CP: in the circumstances were the powers conferred by subsection 141(1) engaged because the ministerial delegates were \u201ccarrying out the Minister\u2019s duties\u201d?\n[19] In the Teamsters case, the Minister\u2019s delegate, a health and safety officer, was investigating a workplace fatality. Subsection 141(4) of the Code, as then enacted, imposed a mandatory requirement that a health and safety officer investigate every death that occurred while an employee was working. Therefore, no question arose before the Tribunal as to whether the investigation of a workplace fatality engaged the powers conferred by subsection 141(1).\n[20] In the Steelworkers case, the ministerial delegate was investigating a formal complaint of workplace violence as then required by subsection 127.1(9) of the Code. Therefore, no question arose whether the delegate was \u201ccarrying out the Minister\u2019s duties\u201d so as to engage subsection 141(1) of the Code. The question before the Tribunal was the scope of the powers conferred on the delegate\u2014specifically, whether subsection 141(1) of the Code authorized the ministerial delegate to issue a direction that did not require the subject of the direction to bring itself into compliance with the Code or an associated regulation. Again, this was a different issue from that raised by CP. No question arose as to whether the facts of that case engaged the powers conferred by subsection 141(1). The Tribunal in Steelworkers, at paragraph 93 of its reasons, did acknowledge that, to exercise any power under subsection 141(1), a ministerial delegate must be \u201ccarrying out the Minister\u2019s duties.\u201d This was the very issue raised by CP but not answered by the Board, despite its reliance upon the Steelworkers case.\n[21] This analysis of the Board\u2019s reasons demonstrates that the Board did not meaningfully grapple with a central issue raised by CP. It failed to specifically consider the text of subsection 141(1) when interpreting the provision and instead relied on a line of authorities that was inapt. What statutory duty were the Regulators purporting to exercise when they sought to monitor the meeting of the Committee? The Board\u2019s failure to meaningfully grapple with this central question renders its decision is unreasonable.\n[22] This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider CP\u2019s argument that it was also denied procedural fairness. As the Board\u2019s consideration of the issue of procedural fairness was inextricably tied to its interpretation of subsection 141(1) of the Code, and as I would remit that question to the Board, I think it preferable that the entire matter be returned to the Board.\n[23] For these reasons, I would allow CP\u2019s application for judicial review with costs, set aside the decision of the Board and return the matter to a differently constituted panel of the Board for redetermination in accordance with these reasons. Upon the consent of the parties, the style of cause should be amended to substitute the \u201cAttorney General of Canada\u201d for \u201cBrenda Baxter, Head of Compliance\u201d as a party respondent.\n\u201cEleanor R.

The two are identical, there being no confidential information disclosed in the confidential reasons.\nGLEASON J.A.\n[1] The appellant, Rovi Guides Inc. (Rovi), appeals from the judgment of the Federal Court in Rovi Guides, Inc. v. Videotron Ltd., 2022 FC 874 (per Lafreni\u00e8re J.). In that judgment, the Federal Court dismissed Rovi\u2019s action against the respondent, Videotron Ltd. (Videotron), for patent infringement and granted Videotron\u2019s counterclaim for declarations of invalidity and non\u2011infringement in respect of several claims in Rovi\u2019s Canadian Patents Nos. 2,337,061, 2,339,629, 2,336,870 (the 870 Patent), and 2,730,344 (the 344 Patent).\n[2] The four Patents all involve interactive television program guide (IPG) technology. This technology, as the Federal Court summarized at paragraph 3 of its reasons:\n\u2026consists of software that generates for display television program listings and recorded content in electronic form that a user can navigate by electronic means. In IPGs, information on available programming content is downloaded or sent to a user\u2019s television equipment, typically a set-top box [STB], and the information is then stored in memory. A STB is so-called because it originally sat on top of the television set. It is also colloquially known as a cable box.\n[3] The Federal Court held that all of the asserted claims were invalid because they were either anticipated and\/or obvious, having regard to the prior art and the common general knowledge of the person skilled in the art to which the Patents were directed (the Skilled Person). While this was sufficient to dismiss Rovi\u2019s action and grant Videotron\u2019s counterclaim, the Federal Court went on to reach conclusions about the appropriate remedy for completeness sake. The Court concluded that, had the claims in suit been valid, Rovi would not have been entitled to an accounting of profits and instead would have only been entitled to a reasonable royalty.\n[4] Rovi has appealed the Federal Court\u2019s findings in respect of the 870 Patent and the 344 Patent, but not the findings in respect of the other two Patents that were at issue before the Federal Court. Rovi argues that the Federal Court made reviewable errors in its obviousness analysis in respect of both Patents and in concluding that Videotron did not infringe the 344 Patent. It also asserts that the Federal Court made reviewable errors in its remedial analysis.\n[5] For the reasons that follow, I find that the Federal Court did not make a reviewable error in its obviousness analysis concerning the 870 Patent and the 344 Patent. Therefore, it is unnecessary to address its non-infringement findings. However, some of its observations on remedy require correction by this Court.These corrections do not affect the diposition of this appeal, which I would accordingly dismiss, with costs.\nI. The Reasons of the Federal Court [6] In reviewing the Federal Court\u2019s reasons, I focus only on those portions that are relevant to the issues that Rovi has raised on appeal. I commence the discussion by saying a little more about the 870 Patent and the 344 Patent.\nA. The 870 Patent and the 344 Patent [7] The 870 Patent was filed on July 13, 1999 and expired on July 13, 2019. The Federal Court found that the priority date for the 870 Patent was June 11, 1999 (after considering two different priority dates listed in the Patent): Federal Court Decision at para. 351. To quote from the reasons of the Federal Court, \u201c[a]t a high level, the 870 Patent relates to IPG systems, and more particularly, to IPG systems that allow users to record programs and program guide data on a media server\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 339.\n[8] At trial, Rovi asserted that Videotron infringed Claims 456 (dependent on 454), 459 (dependent on 457), 720, and 721 of the 870 Patent. These claims read as follows:\nClaim 454\nA method of playing back programs stored on another user's user equipment, comprising:\ngenerating a request to playback a program with a first user equipment, wherein the program was recorded on a second user equipment in response to a record request generated at the second user equipment;\nin response to the request to playback, receiving with the first user equipment the program from the second user equipment;\nand generating for display the received program.\nClaim 456\nThe method of claim 454, wherein the program is a broadcast program.\nClaim 457\nA first user equipment for playing back programs stored on a second user equipment, the first user equipment comprising:\nmeans for generating a request to play back a program with the first user equipment, wherein the program was recorded on the second user equipment in response to a record request generated at the second user equipment;\nmeans for receiving with the first user equipment the program from the second user equipment in response to the request to playback; and\nmeans for generating for display the received program.\nClaim 459\nThe first user equipment of claim 457, wherein the program is a broadcast program.\nClaim 720\nA method for playing back programs, the method comprising:\nreceiving a record request at a first user equipment to record a program on the first user equipment, wherein the first user equipment is coupled to a first display screen configured to generate for display video;\nin response to receiving the record request at the first user equipment, recording the program on the first user equipment;\ntransmitting, from a second user equipment to the first user equipment, a request to play back the program, wherein the second user equipment is coupled to a second display screen configured to generate for display video;\nreceiving, at the first user equipment from the second user equipment, the request to play back the program;\nin response to receiving, at the first user equipment from the second user equipment, the request to play back the program, transmitting the program to the second user equipment;\nreceiving, at the second user equipment, the transmitted program from the first user equipment; and\ngenerating for display, at the second user equipment, the received program on the second display screen.\nClaim 721\nThe method of claim 720, wherein the program is a broadcast program.\n[9] The 344 Patent was filed on July 16, 1999 and expired on July 16, 2019. Its claimed priority date was July 17, 1998, which the Federal Court accepted as appropriate: Federal Court Decision at para. 415. As noted by the Federal Court, \u201c[t]he 344 Patent relates to \u2018interactive media guides\u2019 providing IPG functionality on multiple devices within a household\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 416.\n[10] The claims in the 344 Patent that Rovi alleged were infringed by Videotron were the following:\nClaim 113\nA method for coordinating a first interactive media guide and a second interactive media guide, the method comprising:\nreceiving, from the first interactive media guide, a first indication of a first activity performed on a first user equipment device implementing the first interactive media guide, wherein the first activity is associated with a first program;\nreceiving, from the second interactive media guide, a second indication of a second activity performed on a second user equipment device implementing the second interactive media guide, wherein the second activity is associated with a second program;\nand generating content, for display on the first interactive media guide, based on the first indication from the first interactive media guide and the second indication from the second interactive media guide.\nClaim 116\nThe method of claim 113 further comprising generating content, for display on the second interactive media guide, based on the first indication from the first interactive media guide and the second indication from the second interactive media guide.\nClaim 119\nThe method of claim 113, wherein the first activity and the second activity comprise one or more of adjusting favorite channels, modifying parental control settings, scheduling a recording, adjusting recording settings, adjusting pay-per-view settings, adjusting message settings, adjusting reminders, and modifying user profiles.\nClaim 120\nThe method of claim 113, wherein the first user equipment device and the second user equipment device are located in a household.\nClaim 123\nThe method of claim 113 further comprising:\ngenerating, based on the first indication from the first interactive media guide and the second indication from the second interactive media guide, an aggregated list of scheduled recordings.\nB. The Federal Court\u2019s Obviousness Findings [11] The Federal Court found that the foregoing claims in the 870 Patent and the 344 Patent were obvious and therefore invalid by reason of the common general knowledge of the Skilled Person and the information contained in a document published by the Digital Audio-Visual Council (the Council) in 1998 entitled, \u201cDAVIC 1.3.1 Specification Part 1\u201d (DAVIC).\n[12] The Council was a non-profit organization based in Switzerland. To quote from the Foreword of DAVIC, the Council\u2019s objective was \u201c\u2026to promote the success of interactive digital audio-visual applications and services through the specification of open interfaces and protocols\u201d. DAVIC was the culmination of a multi-year consultation process with equipment manufacturers, service providers, government organizations, and non-members of the Council. As stated in its introduction, DAVIC \u201c\u2026 define[s] the minimum tools and dynamic behaviour required by digital audio-visual systems for end-to-end interoperability across countries, applications and services\u201d.\n[13] The Federal Court found that DAVIC would have been understood by the Skilled Person to be read as a whole. The Court also held that DAVIC reflected the technologies and information that would have already been known to the Skilled Person as of the relevant dates for assessing obviousness.\n[14] In undertaking its obviousness analysis, the Federal Court, at paragraph 296 of its reasons, correctly set out the applicable test from Apotex Inc. v. Sanofi-Synthelabo Canada Inc., 2008 SCC 61, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 265 [Sanofi] at paragraph 67, which requires that a court:\nfirst, identify the notional Skilled Person;\nsecond, identify the relevant common general knowledge of that person;\nthird, identify the inventive concept of the claim(s) in question or, if that cannot readily be done, construe them;\nfourth, identify what, if any, differences exist between the matter cited as forming part of the \u201cstate of the art\u201d and the inventive concept of the claim(s) or the claim(s) as construed; and\nfinally, viewed without any knowledge of the alleged invention as claimed, determine whether those differences constitute steps that would have been obvious to the Skilled Person or whether they require any degree of invention.\n[15] In this appeal, Rovi does not challenge the Federal Court\u2019s findings regarding the attributes of the Skilled Person. Thus, no more needs to be said about the first step in the obviousness analysis.\n[16] As concerns the second step of the obviousness inquiry, the Federal Court held, at paragraph 140 of its reasons, that the common general knowledge of the Skilled Person as of the relevant priority dates would have included the concepts from a number of technologies, namely:\ntelevision delivery technology\u2014both analog and digital\u2014to STBs in the home;\ncomputing technology such as personal computers, Windows 95, and the Internet;\nSTB technology, including the software and applications that operated on STBs, such as interactive guides and other interactive features, including Pay-Per-View and video on demand;\ndesigning and writing software for STBs either directly or using the services of contractors\/vendors; and\ntechnologies associated with networking computers and other electronic devices, which were becoming much more prevalent as of the dates relevant for assessing obviousness.\n[17] With respect to the 870 Patent more particularly, the Federal Court found, at paragraph 392 of its reasons, that the Skilled Person as of the priority date would have:\nbeen familiar with home networks;\nunderstood that once audio-visual content is available on a network, such as from a server, any other device on the network would be able to retrieve the content;\nbeen familiar with multi-room personal video recorders or PVRs;\nunderstood that such PVRs could be networked together; and\nbeen aware of systems such as TiVo and Replay TV that allowed for the recording of programs on digital storage devices.\n[18] The Federal Court construed \u201cusers\u201d in the claims in suit in the 870 Patent as not meaning exclusively persons in the same household. It also construed \u201creceiving\/transmitting the program from or to the second user equipment\u201d as encompassing both streaming and file transfer.\n[19] As concerns the third part of the Sanofi test, the Federal Court found that the inventive concept of the claims in suit in the 870 Patent involved the following features: (1) generating a request to playback a program recorded on a second user\u2019s equipment from the first user\u2019s equipment; and (2) receiving the program from the second user\u2019s equipment with the first user\u2019s equipment. The Court agreed with Videotron\u2019s expert, Mr. Sandoval, that the \u201cessence\u201d of the multi-room digital video recorder (DVR) described in the 870 Patent was networking within the home, one of the benefits of which was that \u201c\u2026STBs could transfer content between each other\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 409.\n[20] As already noted, the Federal Court found the inventive concept of the claims in suit to be obvious in light of the common general knowledge of the Skilled Person and the disclosures contained in DAVIC. Videotron relied in particular on sections 4.06 and 4.07 of the Function Decomposition Table in section 7.3 of DAVIC, which provide:\n4.06 The application should be able to transfer a session to another STU in the same location (for example to transfer a program to a unit in a different room in a home).\n4.07 The application should be able to transfer a session to another STU in a different location (for example to transfer a program to a unit in another home).\n[21] The Federal Court held that the Skilled Person would understand the term \u201cset top units\u201d (or STUs) used in the foregoing sections in DAVIC as being synonymous with STBs: Federal Court Decision at para. 394.\n[22] As concerns the first element of the inventive concept of the claims in suit of the 870 Patent, involving generating a request to playback a program recorded on a second user\u2019s equipment from the first user\u2019s equipment, the Federal Court held that DAVIC showed a home network with many interconnected devices: Federal Court Decision at para. 396. The Court relied on the evidence from Mr. Sandoval that the Skilled Person would know that once a home network was established, every device in the network could \u201ctalk\u201d to every other connected device: Federal Court Decision at para. 396.\n[23] The Federal Court found that this functionality was also expressly described in section 7.2 of DAVIC. That section reads as follows:\nAs multiple digital services begin to penetrate the consumer market, the need will arise for an in-home digital network that will provide selectable access to these services from multiple in-home devices. Furthermore, the introduction of digital storage devices in the home will expand this need. Home networks for DAVIC must support the functions required to link digital consumer devices so that information may be exchanged among these devices in a simple and direct manner.\n[24] The Court further noted at paragraph 396 of its reasons that:\n\u2026The clear identification in [section 7.2 of] DAVIC of \u201cselectable access\u201d, coupled with the reference of such access being for \u201cdigital storage devices in the home\u201d using \u201chome networks for DAVIC\u201d, is strong support for the opinion of Mr. Sandoval that it was known by the skilled person to use an STB to selectably access (i.e. request) a particular service - i.e. the playback of a program stored by another STB.\n[25] As to the second element of the inventive concept of the claims in suit in the 870 Patent involving receiving, there was a dispute between the parties relating to the term \u201csession\u201d in sections 4.06 and 4.07 of the Function Decomposition Table in section 7.3 of DAVIC. The Federal Court preferred the evidence from Mr. Sandoval and found that a \u201csession\u201d was a technical term where there are two points that start and end a session, such that the term would be understood \u201cas referring to streaming content from one STB to another\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 398.\n[26] The Federal Court also accepted Mr. Sandoval\u2019s evidence that the Skilled Person would understand DAVIC as describing streaming content from one STB to another. The Court further agreed with Mr. Sandoval that the Skilled Person would know that they could transfer programs between STBs and that any implementation details would be inherent to the functionality described in DAVIC. The Federal Court therefore concluded that \u201c\u2026to the extent that the specific claim elements such as, for example, a \u2018request to playback a program\u2019 or a \u2018record request\u2019 are not expressly set out in DAVIC, such a gap between the prior art and the [claims in suit] would be obvious to the Skilled Person\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 405.\n[27] Turning now to the 344 Patent, as already noted, the Federal Court found that it was also obvious in light of the common general knowledge of the Skilled Person and DAVIC. According to the Court, the Skilled Person as of the relevant date would have:\nbeen familiar with how to create a network of devices, both as a local area network and a wide area network;\nbeen familiar with digital systems, including personal computers and home networks;\nknown that once devices were connected to a network they could communicate with one another; and\nbeen aware that subscriber level settings could be shared between devices inside a user\u2019s home.\n[Federal Court Decision at para. 452].\n[28] With respect to the inventive concept of the claims in suit in the 344 Patent, the Federal Court held that the key features of all the claims were:\n1) coordinating settings for a first IPG and a second IPG; 2) receiving first\/second indications associated with first\/second programs; 3) displaying an interface with certain content related to the coordinated settings\n[Federal Court Decision at para. 454].\n[29] Rovi alleged that there was a gap between the foregoing and the prior art in that two elements were absent from the prior art\u2014namely, the use of IPGs to carry out the required coordination and a return communication path. Rovi alleged that the gap between these elements and the prior art could not be bridged without inventiveness.\n[30] The Federal Court disagreed. It found that the inventive elements of the claims in suit were obvious in light of DAVIC, and in particular its section 8.14, and the common general knowledge of the Skilled Person. Section 8.14 of DAVIC provides as follows:\n8.14 An application running on one STU should be able to communicate with, and synchronize with, a related application running on a different STU.\n[31] As concerns the first element of the inventive concept of the claims in suit in the 344 Patent involving coordinating settings for a first IPG and a second IPG, the Federal Court again relied on the evidence of Mr. Sandoval and found that the concept of coordinating settings across multiple STBs was identified by DAVIC, which described the ability to exchange information between devices on a home network. While section 8.14 of DAVIC does not use the word \u201ccoordinating\u201d that appears in the claims in suit, the Federal Court held that, for all intents and purposes, synchronization is the same as coordination: Federal Court Decision at para. 459. It also agreed with Mr. Sandoval that the Skilled Person would understand that one of the applications described as being synchronized in section 8.14 of DAVIC was an IPG running on an STB and that synchronizing applications would be understood to mean synchronizing their operation. The Court further agreed with Mr. Sandoval that the Skilled Person would have been familiar with subscriber settings. The Court noted that one such setting that could be synchronized between IPGs was a known subscriber setting, namely, the Pay-Per-View setting: Federal Court Decision at para. 460.\n[32] On the element of receiving first\/second indications associated with first\/second programs, the second of the inventive concepts of the claims in suit in the 344 Patent, the Federal Court held:\nGiven the disclosure in DAVIC that synchronization should be established between STBs on a network, and the [common general knowledge] related to digital devices on a network, the Skilled Person would be able to put into practice a home network comprising multiple STBs, each STB with the ability to synchronize the operation of its application with an application running on another STB.\nI agree with Mr. Sandoval that, once synchronized, the settings would be available on both STBs. Necessarily some \u201cindication\u201d that user settings were adjusted would have to be exchanged by the STBs for the described synchronization to occur.\n[Federal Court Decision at paras. 461\u2013462].\n[33] Finally, on the third element of the inventive concept of the claims in suit in the 344 Patent, the Federal Court held that generating a display of synchronized settings would be obvious because the Skilled Person would be familiar with general IPG and user interface concepts. Thus, \u201c[i]t would not be inventive to the Skilled Person to include a display of the synchronized applications described by DAVIC\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 463.\n[34] The Court concluded that the gaps identified by Rovi\u2019s expert witness \u201c\u2026would have been easily traversed by the Skilled Person by looking to DAVIC and having regard to their [common general knowledge]\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 464. The Court accordingly held that the claims in issue in both the 870 and 344 Patents were obvious and therefore invalid.\n[35] As is apparent from the foregoing summary of the Federal Court\u2019s reasoning on obviousness, it relied to a considerable extent on the evidence from Mr. Sandoval, Videotron\u2019s expert. On the other hand, the Federal Court found that the evidence from Rovi\u2019s expert, Dr. Balakrishnan, \u201c\u2026 and in particular his approach to the prior art, to be less persuasive, consistent, objective and balanced than one would reasonably expect of an independent expert\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 66. The Federal Court preferred the evidence from Mr. Sandoval, holding that \u201cwhile there were some aspects of Mr. Sandoval\u2019s evidence that gave [the Court] pause, overall [he was] a straightforward, credible and reliable witness\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 83.\nC. The Federal Court\u2019s Findings on Remedy [36] I turn next to summarize the Federal Court\u2019s findings regarding remedy.\n[37] As already noted, even though it dismissed Rovi\u2019s action and granted Videotron\u2019s counterclaim, the Federal Court went on to make findings on remedy for the sake of completeness. It held that, had the Patents been valid and infringed, Rovi would not have been entitled to an accounting of profits. Instead, the Court found that Rovi would only be entitled to a reasonable royalty in respect of the claims Videotron would have infringed.\n[38] In deciding against an accounting of profits, the Federal Court cited the decision of this Court in Philip Morris Products S.A. v. Marlboro Canada Limited, 2016 FCA 55, [2016] F.C.J. No. 175 [Marlboro FCA], at paragraph 8, for the proposition that while the remedy of an accounting of profits is a discretionary one, a court should not refuse an accounting in the absence of compelling reasons. The Federal Court found that factors relevant to awarding an accounting of profits include: (i) whether there has been undue delay in commencing or prosecuting the litigation; (ii) the patentee\u2019s conduct; (iii) the infringer\u2019s conduct; (iv) whether the patentee practiced the invention of the patent in Canada; and (v) the complexity of calculating an accounting of profits: Federal Court Decision at para. 581.\n[39] The Federal Court first assessed Videotron\u2019s allegation of delay and noted that \u201c[w]here a patentee has delayed commencing their action toward the infringer, thereby deliberately allowing an infringer to accumulate profits in an inordinate manner, an accounting of profits may be denied\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 582. The Federal Court held that Rovi had not delayed commencing the action and that the first factor was therefore neutral.\n[40] As concerns the second factor of Rovi\u2019s conduct, the Federal Court found that it weighed heavily against awarding an accounting of profits. More particularly, it found Rovi\u2019s business model of pursuing licence agreements in the way it did, the length of time Rovi took to prosecute the Patents before the Patent Office, and Rovi\u2019s dealings with Videotron all militated against awarding an accounting of profits.\n[41] As concerns Rovi\u2019s business model, the Federal Court wrote, at paragraph 586 of its reasons, that:\n\u2026Rovi has a reputation of using hard-ball legal tactics to pressure third parties to license its patent portfolio. Rovi was known for its business model of aggregating patent portfolios, seeking licences, and relying on its prior licences and aggressive use of litigation to drive risk-avoiding businesses into deals that are consistent with its schedule of royalty fees. It would spend in the tens of millions of dollars annually on patent litigation.\n[Federal Court Decision at para. 586].\n[42] The Federal Court further determined that Rovi had apparently followed a deliberate strategy of delaying the prosecution of its Patents in suit because the Patents were issued between 13 and 17 years after their priority dates. In making this finding, the Federal Court noted that one of Rovi\u2019s expert witnesses confirmed that \u201c\u2026patent holdup was a problem because once a potential infringer has launched a product it reduces flexibility and an opportunistic patent holder can then try to extract a larger, unreasonable licencing fee\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 590. However, the Federal Court had no evidence about what led to the delays in the prosecution of the Patents in suit nor about usual prosecution practice before the Patent Office in Canada.\n[43] The Federal Court went on to note that Rovi had not disclosed to Videotron full details of the claims in the Patents that it alleged were being infringed, finding that Rovi behaved this way because it wanted to prevent Videotron from designing around the relevant claims. The Court wrote that it was:\n\u2026quite apparent\u2026that the reason why Rovi declined to reveal to Videotron a complete list of specific patent claims it considered infringed was to prevent Videotron from designing around them. Rovi took the position that even after all four patents in suit expire, Videotron would not be free to continue carrying on its current activities as there were always other patents that Rovi would be able to assert against Videotron.\n[Federal Court Decision at para. 592].\n[44] The Federal Court also relied on the fact that Rovi had not provided Videotron with specific information about the value of the Patents when it sought a licence agreement renewal. The Federal Court further noted that Rovi had not sent a cease and desist letter to Videotron before commencing the litigation. While accepting that sending such a letter was not required to obtain an accounting of profits, the Federal Court nonetheless found that \u201c\u2026bringing legal proceedings against a party who declines to enter into a licence without first giving that party an opportunity to assess the claim and attempt to resolve the dispute smacks of retaliation\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 593.\n[45] The Federal Court concluded its assessment of Rovi\u2019s conduct by stating that, \u201cRovi\u2019s questionable business practices cannot help but serve to colour [the Court\u2019s] view of the value of the features that it claims in the Patents. This factor weighs heavily against Rovi\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 594.\n[46] As concerns the third factor of Videotron\u2019s conduct, the Federal Court found Videotron behaved appropriately even though it had not provided any technical response to Rovi\u2019s claim that the Videotron system violated its Patents. The Court held that this factor was neutral.\n[47] The Federal Court found the fourth factor, whether a patentee practiced the invention of the patent in Canada, to be neutral because there was some evidence that, in addition to licencing its Patents, Rovi provided products to Pay-TV providers in Canada.\n[48] With respect to the final factor associated with calculating an accounting of profits, the Federal Court held that complexity, in and of itself, would not preclude the remedy. However, in light of the evidence called by the parties, the Federal Court concluded that an award of an accounting of profits was not appropriate because it was not satisfied that using any of the methods proposed by Rovi to calculate Videotron\u2019s profits would allow the Court to arrive at a reliable and appropriate amount: Federal Court Decision at para. 607.\n[49] The Federal Court accordingly determined that, had the Patents been valid, it would not have been appropriate to award an accounting of profits. Instead, the Federal Court stated that it would award a reasonable royalty, based on a reasonable royalty rate that Rovi could have reached with Videotron. In assessing what such a rate would have been, the Federal Court accepted Videotron\u2019s submission that \u201c\u2026the appropriate remedy [was] a one-time reasonable royalty, capped at no more than Videotron\u2019s cost to remove or design-around the subject-matter of the relevant asserted patent claim\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 611. The Court went on, in the same paragraph, to conclude that, \u201c\u2026the approximate cost for such a design change would have been $150,000 per feature\u201d. However, the Federal Court made this finding without finding what such design changes would have been, accepting Videotron\u2019s assertions that it could have made the required changes.\nII. Analysis [50] I turn now to evaluate the various arguments that Rovi advances before this Court.\nA. Did the Federal Court Err in its Obviousness Analysis? [51] As refined during its oral submissions, Rovi alleges that the Federal Court made three errors of law in its obviousness analysis. First, Rovi argues that the Federal Court erred in relying on the evidence from Mr. Sandoval because he was misinformed as to the attributes of the notional Skilled Person and therefore approached the obviousness inquiry incorrectly. Second, Rovi asserts that the Federal Court fell into the error of applying hindsight bias. Third, Rovi alleges that the Federal Court had a coloured view of Rovi and of its Patents, as evidenced in particular by paragraph 594 of the Court\u2019s reasons, where the Court relied on extraneous and irrelevant factors. This coloured view, according to Rovi, taints the Federal Court\u2019s obviousness analysis.\n[52] I am not persuaded by any of the foregoing arguments that the Federal Court committed reversible error.\n[53] Before delving into each of Rovi\u2019s arguments, it is important to remember that a trial court\u2019s findings on obviousness are findings of mixed fact and law. Thus, absent an extricable error of law, they are reviewable only if they disclose a palpable and overriding error: Packers Plus Energy Services Inc. v. Essential Energy Services Ltd., 2019 FCA 96, 164 C.P.R. (4th) 191, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 38694 (19 December 2019) at para. 29 [Packers], citing Teva Canada Limited v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2019 FCA 15, 163 C.P.R. (4th) 265 at para. 23 [Pfizer]; Teva Canada Limited v. Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc., 2013 FCA 244, [2013] F.C.J. No. 1108 at paras. 10-12; Alcon Canada Inc. v. Actavis Pharma Company, 2015 FCA 191, [2015] F.C.J. No. 1083 at para. 11.\n[54] Determinations as to the state of the art and as to the nature and extent of the skilled person\u2019s common general knowledge are likewise findings of mixed fact and law, reviewable only if they disclose a palpable and overriding error: Packers at para. 30, citing Apotex Inc. v. Allergan Inc., 2015 FCA 137, [2015] F.C.J. No. 953 at para. 7 [Allergan]; AFD Petroleum Ltd. v. Frac Shack Inc., 2018 FCA 140, 157 C.P.R. (4th) 195 at para. 38 [Frac Shack].\n[55] This Court and the Supreme Court of Canada have underscored on multiple occasions that the palpable and overriding standard is a highly deferential one. \u201cPalpable\u201d means an error that is obvious and \u201coverriding\u201d means that the error affects the outcome. As the Supreme Court put it in Salomon v. Matte-Thompson, 2019 SCC 14, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 729 [Salomon], \u201c[w]here the deferential standard of palpable and overriding error applies, an appellate court can intervene only if there is an obvious error in the trial decision that is determinative of the outcome of the case\u201d: at para. 33, citing Canada v. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 FCA 165, [2012] F.C.J. No. 669, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 34946 (6 December 2012); see also Benhaim v. St-Germain, 2016 SCC 48, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 352 at para. 38.\n[56] Thus, in a case like the present, it is not the task of this Court in appellate review to sift through and reweigh the evidence the Federal Court used to ground its obviousness findings nor to re-decide which expert is to be preferred: see Pfizer at para. 31; Eli Lilly and Company v. Apotex Inc., 2010 FCA 240, [2010] F.C.J. No. 1199 at para. 8; E. Mishan & Sons, Inc. v. Supertek Canada Inc., 2015 FCA 163, 134 C.P.R. (4th) 207 at para. 25. As the Supreme Court underscored in Salomon \u201c[t]he fact that an alternative factual finding could be reached based on a different ascription of weight [to evidence] does not mean that a palpable and overriding error has been made\u201d: at para. 33, citing Nelson (City) v. Mowatt, 2017 SCC 8, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 138 at para. 38.\n(1) Did the Federal Court Err in Relying on Mr. Sandoval\u2019s Evidence? [57] Bearing these cautions in mind, I turn now to assess Rovi\u2019s first argument.\n[58] As already noted, Rovi says that the Federal Court erred in relying on the evidence from Mr. Sandoval because he was misinformed about the attributes of the Skilled Person and therefore approached the obviousness inquiry incorrectly. Rovi more particularly submits that Mr. Sandoval defined the Skilled Person as being inventive, which is the opposite of what the case law instructs.\n[59] Rovi is correct that the governing legal principles applicable to defining the Skilled Person require that they not be inventive. Indeed, the notion of the Skilled Person exists so as to remove the application of inventiveness from the obviousness analysis. The classic \u201ctouchstone for obviousness is the technician skilled in the art but having no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination; a paragon of deduction and dexterity, wholly devoid of intuition; a triumph of the left hemisphere over the right\u201d: Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research, 2020 FCA 30, [2020] F.C.J. No. 179 at para. 79 [Hospira], citing Beloit Canada Ltd. v. Valmet Oy, [1986] F.C.J. No. 87, 8 C.P.R. (3d) 289 (F.C.A.) at 294 [Beloit FCA 1986]. As this Court stated in Beloit FCA 1986 at page 294:\nThe test for obviousness is not to ask what competent inventors did or would have done to solve the problem. Inventors are by definition inventive. The classical touchstone for obviousness is the technician skilled in the art but having no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination; a paragon of deduction and dexterity, wholly devoid of intuition; a triumph of the left hemisphere over the right. The question to be asked is whether this mythical creature (the man in the Clapham omnibus of patent law) would, in the light of the state of the art and of common general knowledge as at the claimed date of invention, have come directly and without difficulty to the solution taught by the patent. It is a very difficult test to satisfy.\n[60] In other words, the notional Skilled Person, through whose eyes a patent is to be read, is different from the inventor who does creative work and makes an invention: Amgen Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2015 FC 1261, [2015] F.C.J. No. 1382 at para. 86, aff\u2019d 2016 FCA 196, [2016] F.C.J. No. 765, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 37124 (27 October 2016).\n[61] The common general knowledge of such an uninventive notional being is derived from \u201ca common sense approach to the question of what would be known, in fact, to an appropriately skilled person that could be found in real life, who is good at his or her job\u201d: Eli Lilly Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2018 FC 736, 156 C.P.R. (4th) 387 at para. 46, quoting Eli Lilly & Co. v. Apotex Inc., 2009 FC 991, [2009] F.C.J. No. 1229 at para. 97, aff\u2019d 2010 FCA 240, [2010] F.C.J. No. 1199 [Eli Lilly]. As part of this, \u201c[t]he skilled person is assumed to be reasonably diligent in keeping abreast of advances in the field to which the patent relates\u201d: Johnson & Johnson Inc. v. Boston Scientific Ltd., 2008 FC 552, 71 C.P.R. (4th) 123 at para. 373, citing Whirlpool Corp. v. Camco Inc., 2000 SCC 67, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1067 at para. 74 [Whirlpool].\n[62] With these principles in mind, it is useful next to reproduce the Federal Court\u2019s findings relevant to Rovi\u2019s first issue. They were as follows:\nWhen Mr. Sandoval was retained as an expert by Videotron, he was instructed that the skilled person is not inventive by nature. In defining the skilled person in his expert report on validity of the Patents, Mr. Sandoval stated that the person reading the Patents \u201cwould have been focused primarily on new technology for the cable industry rather than on simply maintaining existing infrastructure.\u201d Mr. Sandoval struggled during his cross-examination to explain what he meant by the concept of a skilled person \u201cfocussing on new technology\u201d, at one point suggesting that \u201cone can innovate without being inventive.\u201d\nRovi submits that Mr. Sandoval in effect defined an inventive skilled person, which would conflict with the description of the skilled person by Mr. Justice Rothstein, in Sanofi at para 52, as a \u201c\u2026 technician skilled in the art but having no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination \u2026\u201d I disagree.\nI found that Mr. Sandoval was instead grappling, as I have had to do, with the question that has to be asked in an obviousness case. This involves a comparison between the state of the art and [the common general knowledge] of the skilled person, on the one hand, and the inventive concept of the patent\u2019s claims, on the other (Sanofi at para 67). If there is no difference between the two comparators, the claims are obvious. If there is a difference, the claims are obvious if the skilled person would not need to take any inventive steps to bridge the gap. In other words, a step may be taken that can be viewed as different, but would not necessarily be inventive.\nWhile the hypothetical skilled person is deemed to be uninventive as part of their fictional personality, they are thought to be reasonably diligent in keeping up with advances in the field to which the patent relates. As stated by Justice Binnie in Whirlpool at paragraph 74, the [common general knowledge] of the skilled person undergoes \u201ccontinuous evolution and growth.\u201d Mr. Sandoval clarified during his cross-examination that he appreciated that this was a nuanced topic. In my view, there was therefore nothing untoward with Mr. Sandoval defining the skilled person as keeping abreast of new technology.\n[Federal Court Decision at paras. 104\u2013107].\n[63] As stated earlier, these are findings of mixed fact and law, reviewable only if they disclose a palpable and overriding error: see Packers at para. 30, citing Allergan at para. 7; Frac Shack at para. 38.\n[64] It is also necessary to consider the evidence of Mr. Sandoval that led the Federal Court to make these findings. I turn first to Mr. Sandoval\u2019s report. While the following paragraphs specifically state that they relate to the 870 Patent, the report confirms that the Skilled Person of the other Patents at issue at trial had the same characteristics as the Skilled Person for the 870 Patent. Mr Sandoval wrote as follows:\n24. In my opinion, the person skilled in the art for the 870 Patent would have been a \u201cnotional\u201d person with an understanding of, and experience of, the technology and subscriber features relating to the cable television industry as of the 1990s. Such a person would have had extensive experience with the analog cable systems that were then common. The person would also have had exposure to, and knowledge of, over the air broadcast systems, satellite television systems and the transition to digital systems for both broadcast and cable systems. The notional skilled person would have had a general understanding of the main components of a cable system, including the cable head-end, the system that provided connections to subscribers' residences, the set top boxes (STBs) present in the subscribers' premises, and the features available to subscribers. For STBs, the skilled person would have had knowledge and experience with different versions and types of STBs, and been part of discussions of features to offer subscribers by way of those different types of STBs.\n25. I note that at numerous points in the description of the 870 Patent (as well as in the 061, 344 and 629 Patents), the description says that \u201cany suitable\u201d technology could be used. In my view, this implies that the skilled person have sufficient knowledge and experience to identify what technology could be used in the described context in order to understand what is being described and to put the invention to use.\n26. The notional skilled person would have been familiar with personal recording of broadcast content using a VCR, would be familiar with the concept of client-server architectures, and would be familiar with the concept of session based content delivery as supported be [sic] emerging Video-On-Demand (VOD) systems.\n27. In terms of the transition to digital systems, the skilled person would have had access to and be able to work with software engineers and developers either as part of the same company or through outside vendors. These would include software engineers and developers who could implement software running on STBs. The knowledge of the skilled person would therefore include the knowledge and experience of such engineers and developers. Such knowledge includes experience and information relating to digital systems, processors, computers, computer storage systems, computer networks and the Internet.\n28. Further, the addressee of the patent would have had a good understanding of how program guides were provided to subscribers of cable systems. The person of skill would have had experience with, and knowledge of, designing and implementing program guides for cable system subscribers as of the 1990s. That experience would have included some knowledge of human-factors engineering and GUI (graphical user interface) design.\n29. The skilled person reading the patents would have been focused primarily on new technology for the cable industry, rather than on simply maintaining existing infrastructure.\n30. In my view, a skilled person could be thought of as having had at least three years of experience in the field in order to obtain the set of skills and knowledge described. While such a skilled person would not necessarily have had an undergraduate degree, with the level of skill and experience the person would have had, as outlined above, an undergraduate degree in computer science, communications or electrical engineering would be expected. [Emphasis added.]\n[65] Rovi takes issue in particular with paragraph 29 of the report. There, Mr. Sandoval describes the Skilled Person as being focussed \u201cprimarily on new technology for the cable industry, rather than on simply maintaining existing infrastructure\u201d (emphasis added). This, according to Rovi, signals that the Skilled Person, as defined by Mr. Sandoval, is inventive.\n[66] Rovi asserts that the Federal Court erred, at paragraph 107, in stating that the Skilled Person was merely \u201ckeeping abreast of new technology\u201d because Mr. Sandoval\u2019s Skilled Person went far beyond \u201ckeeping abreast\u201d of new technology in that they were developing it. In addition to the above section from his report, Rovi also relies on the following excerpts of Mr. Sandoval\u2019s cross-examination:\nQ. And so when you said the skilled person would be focusing on new technology for the cable industry, you mean the skilled person would be developing new technology, correct?\nA. In general, yes, that's right.\nQ. That would mean that your skilled person would be coming up with things that didn't exist yet?\nA. Yeah. So, you know, this is an interesting point between what is the difference between extending what exists in ways that are obvious versus what requires invention. So to be honest, you know, I had to very -- and that's why I mentioned just a moment ago that I tried to keep this concept in mind, because the boundary between when is something sort of an inevitable conclusion that maybe somebody didn't tell you, but that you would arrive at, versus what is something that you would be creating something. Maybe somebody else created the same thing, but you never heard about it. So the difference between, say, innovation and invention, that's potentially a fine line, and so I tried to be very aware of that. And so every engineer -- engineers make things. That means engineers are always solving problems. By the nature of the job, they're doing things that are new. So that's the nature of the profession. You're always doing new things. Now, whether it's particularly inventive or not, then, you know, it's -- that's something to explore, was this invented. So I was very well aware of this aspect, and I incorporated that into my opinions.\nQ. So your skilled person is somebody who is trying to do something that's new?\nA. Without being particularly inventive, yes.\nQ. So they're being innovative?\nA. Like I said, this is a nuanced topic. Maybe if we agree that one can innovate without being inventive.\nQ. But that's your position, that one can innovate without being inventive?\nA. Well, I'm suggesting that we use those terms to try to grapple with this sort of subtle distinction. You know, what is inventive whereas what is just that's what you do, is you make things.\nQ. Again, you're talking about -- you're being informed by your views about what engineers are like in the real world, correct?\nA. Not just engineers, but more generally people in the technology sphere. Right? So it could be a marketing person who has some technical aptitude. Right? Their job is to figure out what are we going to do next, boss, what's coming down the pipe. Whatever term you call it, maybe innovation is not the best term, but it's soaking up ideas from around them and seeing how to apply those. Those applications may not require much in the way of invention, but that's the nature of the skilled person, is they're working on new things.\nQ. When you say the nature of the skilled person, we're talking about the skilled person that you used as your lens for your analysis, correct?\nA. That's correct.\nQ. So you said that that's their job, they have got to soak up ideas and they have to come up with new products, that's what people do in the tech industry?\nA. I think that's fair to say, yes.\nQ. Again, that's the type of person that you approach your analysis from?\nA. In general, that's one sort of slice into the character or skill or role of the skilled person. That's what I wanted to point out here in section, 29 is there are people who would have this general common knowledge perhaps, but they are in a role where they're not really expected to apply that general knowledge into solving any kind of a particular problem. Where, you know, they may very well be a skilled person conceivably; however, their role is really just keeping the airplane flying, so to speak. Does that make any sense?\nQ. Well, I'm not sure. So your -- I think what you're trying to tell me is that -- in [paragraph] 29 [of your report] you say: \u201cThe skilled person reading the patents would have been focused primarily on new technology for the cable industry rather than on simply maintaining existing infrastructure.\u201d Are you now telling me that the person that's just focused on maintaining existing infrastructure is a skilled person according to your definition or is not a skilled person?\nA. I guess what I'm saying here is even though that person may very well have the technical aptitude, that we're going to not consider them a skilled person because when I consider the skilled person through my particular perspective, it's a person who is by the nature of their role is going to be as you described it, absorbing what's happening in the broader industry in the broader world. And seeing how that can, what makes sense can be adopted to their business.\nQ. \u2026 You said: \u201cSo it was, you know, a time that where change was afoot within the cable TV industry, so everybody in the industry was aware of new emerging features that they weren't available on the set-top box immediately. It was, you know, it was certainly within the realm of the possible in the near future.\u201d Do you remember giving that evidence earlier?\nA. Yes.\nQ. So again, in your explanation of what the common general knowledge of the skilled person is, you've defined that person as forward-looking, correct?\nA. Yeah, I did assert that, yes. [Emphasis added.]\n[67] Considering the foregoing evidence, I see no reviewable error in the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that, overall, Mr. Sandoval was describing a Skilled Person who was keeping up with advances in an area of rapidly developing technology but one who was not inventive. This, in my view, is in line with Justice Binnie\u2019s assertion in Whirlpool that the common general knowledge of the Skilled Person undergoes \u201ccontinuous evolution and growth\u201d: Whirlpool at para. 74.\n[68] In sum, while I agree with Rovi and the Federal Court that Mr. Sandoval used language that was at times confusing, this use of language does not mean that the Federal Court committed a reviewable error in relying on portions of Mr. Sandoval\u2019s testimony in support of its obviousness findings. The Federal Court was alive to the issue of Mr. Sandoval\u2019s articulation of the attributes of the Skilled Person, and Mr. Sandoval appropriately nuanced his statements during his cross-examination, as the above-cited passage demonstrates.\n[69] Moreover, the Federal Court did not rely solely on Mr. Sandoval\u2019s evidence in its obviousness analysis. It also premised its findings on its own review of DAVIC, albeit reading DAVIC through the application of what the Federal Court found to be the Skilled Person\u2019s common general knowledge.\n[70] At the end of the day, assessments of the strength of the evidence and determinations to prefer the testimony of one witness over another are the province of a trial court. These matters lie at the very heart of a trial court\u2019s function as the trier of fact. Here, given that Mr. Sandoval\u2019s testimony was much more nuanced than Rovi asserts, and the use that the Federal Court made of such testimony, I see no reviewable error in the Federal Court\u2019s reliance on Mr. Sandoval\u2019s evidence that would justify our intervention. In short, it is not for this Court, as an appellate court acting on a paper record alone, to substitute its views and reject Mr. Sandoval\u2019s testimony where there is no legal error in the Federal Court\u2019s preference for his evidence.\n[71] Therefore, I conclude that the first ground advanced by Rovi fails.\n(2) Did the Federal Court Fall into Error by Applying Hindsight Bias? [72] I turn now to Rovi\u2019s second argument. As already noted, Rovi asserts that the Federal Court erred by falling into hindsight bias.\n[73] This argument is premised, in part, on Rovi\u2019s first argument that the Federal Court erred in accepting Mr. Sandoval\u2019s evidence of obviousness in light of his definition of the Skilled Person. For the foregoing reasons, this argument fails.\n[74] In addition, Rovi submits that hindsight bias flowed from Mr. Sandoval\u2019s alleged lack of experience in respect of the technology involved in the 870 and 344 Patents. Rovi further says that the Federal Court misconstrued DAVIC with hindsight, concluding that it was \u201ca full specification\u201d for digital audio-visual systems when both parties\u2019 experts agreed that it was not.\n[75] I disagree with these submissions.\n[76] The Federal Court was very much alive to Mr. Sandoval\u2019s alleged lack of experience, devoting several paragraphs in its reasons to this issue:\nMr. Sandoval could not speak from personal knowledge acquired at the time as to the [common general knowledge] at the dates relevant to the Patents (1998 and 1999). His view of the [common general knowledge], and other related issues in relation to this matter, had to be reconstructed from other information. There is therefore reason to be concerned about the reliability of this type of look-back evidence and the risk of hindsight bias. Hindsight bias is a danger that experts and the Court must be wary of in any patent litigation, as experts are inevitably asked to opine on technology that was developed in the past, often with a lengthy intervening period where technology has accelerated appreciably.\nMy concerns about hindsight bias on the part of Mr. Sandoval were allayed somewhat by the fact that he was looking back at the technology commercially deployed in homes that had not changed very much over the previous few years. Moreover, Mr. Sandoval did not come out of nowhere to become CableLabs\u2019 chief software architect. Between 1985 and 1999, he worked at several companies developing software for interactive applications, including interactive multimedia platform on laser discs, Compact Disc Interactive and in the gaming industry for 3DO and Electronic Arts. At the time, 3DO was also working with other companies to provide STB systems for on-demand video streaming. While Mr. Sandoval may not have been a member of the team working on the project, he was aware and interested in what the team was doing.\nI also note that Mr. Sandoval conducted his research to acquaint himself with matters that would have been relevant to and known to at least some of the skilled team back in 2001. He was required to understand the technology historically in his new position. He also based his opinions on objective information that preceded the priority dates of the Patents, as well on matters that arose directly out of his principal expertise.\nMr. Sandoval is an expert at developing applications on embedded devices in general. From his perspective, whether presenting the content from a multi-media disk or from a television tuner, the challenges, the design principles, and the mechanisms to build applications on an embedded device, are the same. He was therefore in a good position, given his extensive experience, to give useful evidence about what the skilled person would have known and understood at the relevant time.\n[Federal Court Decision at paras. 89\u201392].\n[77] I see no error of fact or principle in the foregoing. The Federal Court was very alert to the potential for hindsight. As well, the Court clearly articulated that, despite some risk of hindsight bias, it was ultimately satisfied that Mr. Sandoval\u2019s knowledge and experience gave him the expertise needed to consider the content from a multi-media disk or from a television tuner, as well as the challenges and related design principles at issue. This conclusion was open to the Federal Court to make. Thus, this argument fails.\n[78] As concerns the allegation that the Federal Court misconstrued DAVIC with hindsight by concluding it was \u201ca full specification\u201d for digital audio-visual systems, the Federal Court did use the words \u201cfull specification\u201d to describe DAVIC. However, it immediately thereafter qualified this by stating that DAVIC \u201c\u2026define[d] \u2018the minimum tools and dynamic behaviour needed by digital audio-visual systems for end-to-end interoperability across countries, applications and services\u2019\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 69, quoting DAVIC\u2019s introduction.\n[79] I see no reviewable error in the Federal Court\u2019s use of the words \u201cfull specification\u201d, even though these words do not precisely describe how the experts qualified DAVIC. The clarification given by the Federal Court as to what it meant was appropriate and in accordance with the testimony of the expert witnesses about the nature of DAVIC. The Federal Court\u2019s clarification also corresponds to what DAVIC, itself, says. On this point, it seems to me that Rovi has seized on two words of limited significance in reasons of more than 600 paragraphs to try to elevate them to a reviewable error, when they are not.\n[80] In essence, the allegations of hindsight bias advanced by Rovi are no more than an attempt to have us redo the Federal Court\u2019s obviousness analysis and arrive at a different conclusion. However, as already noted, that is not the role of this Court. It can intervene only if the Federal Court errs in law or makes a palpable and overriding error of fact. On hindsight bias, the Federal Court made no such error.\n(3) Did the Federal Court Have a Coloured View of Rovi that Tainted its Obviousness Analysis? [81] The third error of law alleged by Rovi is that the Federal Court allowed a tainted view of Rovi to improperly colour its obviousness analysis. Rovi relies in particular on paragraph 594 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons. There, the Court wrote that: \u201cRovi\u2019s questionable business practices cannot help but serve to colour [the Court\u2019s] view of the value of the features that it claims in the Patents. This factor weighs heavily against Rovi.\u201d\n[82] I agree with Rovi that it is erroneous to suggest that there is any link between a company\u2019s business practices and the validity or value of its patents. A hard-nosed company that engages in scorched-earth litigation may nonetheless possess a valid, valuable patent. While some of a company\u2019s practices may be relevant to the exercise of the Court\u2019s discretion in determining the type of remedy to award, as is discussed more fully below, its business practices are irrelevant to the validity or value of its patent portfolio (provided the company does not run afoul of section 53 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4 [Patent Act], which sets out the circumstances in which a patent is void if the patentee makes certain kinds of misrepresentations in its patent application).\n[83] That said, it must be recalled that the Federal Court did not rely on its view of Rovi\u2019s business practices in its discussion of validity. The comments that Rovi impugns were made in paragraph 594 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons, in the portion dealing with remedy. There is no indication in the Court\u2019s lengthy discussion of the validity issues that it was in any way influenced by its views of Rovi\u2019s business practices. Therefore, I conclude that the comments made in paragraph 594 on remedy do not warrant setting aside the Federal Court\u2019s findings on validity.\n[84] Thus, I would not interfere with the Federal Court\u2019s findings on obviousness.\nB. Did the Federal Court Err in its Remedial Analysis? [85] While the foregoing means that this appeal must be dismissed, I believe it is necessary for this Court to address the errors that the Federal Court made in discussing the remedies it would have awarded had the Patents been found valid and to have been infringed.\n[86] Rovi alleges that the Federal Court made several errors in principle in its remedial analysis. It first submits that the Federal Court inappropriately qualified as neutral the factors of (1) Rovi\u2019s lack of delay in bringing proceedings, (2) Rovi having practiced the inventions claimed in the Patents, and (3) Videotron\u2019s conduct in practicing these inventions as opposed to signing a new licencing agreement with Rovi. Rovi argues that these factors should instead have led the Federal Court to award an accounting of profits.\n[87] Secondly, Rovi says that the Federal Court inappropriately relied on Rovi\u2019s conduct to disentitle it to the accounting of profits, including Rovi\u2019s so-called \u201chard-ball\u201d litigation tactics. These, it says, are not relevant considerations in deciding whether to award an accounting of profits. Rovi submits, citing A.I. Enterprises v. Bram Enterprises Ltd., 2014 SCC 12, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 177 and Martel Building v. R., 2000 SCC 60, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 860 [Martel], that parties owe no duties of good faith in pre-contractual negotiations and are entitled to pursue their own self-interest in such negotiations. It says it did precisely that and was entitled to engage in hard bargaining with Videotron. Rovi further submits that the Federal Court had no evidence of the normal practice in patent prosecutions before the Patent Office in Canada, and thus could not rely in any way on the time it took between the date the applications for the Patents in suit were made and the date they were issued. Rovi also says that there is nothing improper in it not having provided Videotron with full details of every claim in the Patents that Rovi relied on when it was seeking to re-negotiate its licence with Videotron. Rovi further submits that there is no rule that a party must send a cease and desist letter before commencing litigation.\n[88] Next, Rovi asserts that the Federal Court incorrectly relied on the complexity of the calculations required to ascertain the profits that Rovi could have made as a reason for denying the remedy of an accounting of profits.\n[89] Finally, Rovi argues that the Federal Court incorrectly assessed the damages it awarded because the cost of developing unidentified non-infringing alternatives that Videotron alleged it could have developed cannot be used to ascertain the amount of a reasonable royalty. It adds that the Federal Court wrongly ignored the amounts previously paid by Videotron to Rovi for a licence, which Rovi says ought to have been the key factor in the assessment of damages.\n[90] As will soon become apparent, Rovi is correct in many of these assertions. Before addressing each of Rovi\u2019s assertions, it is useful to make some general comments about remedies in patent infringement cases.\n(1) Remedies for Patent Infringement [91] Remedies available for patent infringement are set out in sections 55 and 57 of the Patent Act.\n[92] Section 55 provides for damages for patent infringement and for reasonable compensation for damage sustained between the date that a specification is laid open for public inspection under the Patent Act and the date that the patent is issued, when the patent cannot yet be infringed because it has not yet been granted. Subsections 55(1) and (2) of the Patent Act provide:\nLiability for patent infringement\nContrefa\u00e7on et recours\n55. (1) A person who infringes a patent is liable to the patentee and to all persons claiming under the patentee for all damage sustained by the patentee or by any such person, after the grant of the patent, by reason of the infringement.\n55. (1) Quiconque contrefait un brevet est responsable envers le brevet\u00e9 et toute personne se r\u00e9clamant de celui-ci du dommage que cette contrefa\u00e7on leur a fait subir apr\u00e8s l\u2019octroi du brevet.\nLiability damage before patent is granted\nIndemnit\u00e9 raisonnable\n(2) A person is liable to pay reasonable compensation to a patentee and to all persons claiming under the patentee for any damage sustained by the patentee or by any of those persons by reason of any act on the part of that person, after the specification contained in the application for the patent became open to public inspection, in English or French, under section 10 and before the grant of the patent, that would have constituted an infringement of the patent if the patent had been granted on the day the specification became open to public inspection, in English or French, under that section.\n(2) Est responsable envers le brevet\u00e9 et toute personne se r\u00e9clamant de celui-ci, \u00e0 concurrence d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 raisonnable, quiconque accomplit un acte leur faisant subir un dommage apr\u00e8s la date \u00e0 laquelle le m\u00e9moire descriptif compris dans la demande de brevet est devenu accessible au public, en fran\u00e7ais ou en anglais, sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019article 10 et avant la date de l\u2019octroi du brevet, dans le cas o\u00f9 cet acte aurait constitu\u00e9 une contrefa\u00e7on si le brevet avait \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9 \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 ce m\u00e9moire descriptif est ainsi devenu accessible.\n[93] Turning more particularly to the principles applicable to the assessment of damages under subsection 55(1) of the Patent Act, such damages focus on the loss suffered by a plaintiff\u2014i.e. the patentee or a party claiming under the patentee, such as a licensee\u2014and are compensatory in nature. More specifically, damages for patent infringement under subsection 55(1) of the Patent Act are aimed at compensating the plaintiff for the losses incurred by reason of the infringement. Among other things, such damages may take the form of compensation for lost profits associated with sales lost or price suppression suffered by the plaintiff by reason of the infringement or compensation for income lost by the plaintiff where it has a practice of entering into licencing arrangements: Nova Chemicals Corp. v. Dow Chemical Co., 2022 SCC 43, 199 C.P.R. (4th) 107 at para. 7 [Nova Chemicals]. Where the plaintiff has a past practice of licencing its patents, the licence fees it typically charges are often used to establish the quantum of damages for lost licencing income: Nova Chemicals at para. 7.\n[94] However, there may be circumstances where a plaintiff cannot establish that it has lost sales and has no relevant practice of licencing the invention that the court accepts as the basis for measuring damages. In such circumstances, a court may award damages calculated via a hypothetical \u201creasonable royalty\u201d on the sales made by the infringer: Nova Chemicals at para. 7, citing AlliedSignal Inc. v. Du Pont Canada Inc. (1998), 78 C.P.R. (3d) 129 (F.C. (T.D.)), at para. 199 [AlliedSignal]; Unilever PLC et al. v. Proctor & Gamble Inc. [1993] F.C.J. No. 117, 47 C.P.R. (3d) 479 (FC), aff\u2019d [1995] F.C.J. No. 1005, 61 C.P.R. (3d) 499 (F.C.A.) at 571 [Unilever]. Setting the hypothetical reasonable royalty rate in this fashion requires the court to determine the terms that the parties would have agreed to had they negotiated a royalty. As noted in AlliedSignal, \u201c[t]he test is what rate would result from negotiations between a willing licensor and a willing licensee\u201d: at para. 199.\n[95] In addition to the remedy in damages, the Patent Act also provides for equitable remedies, notably an accounting of profits (or disgorgement) and injunctions. Subsection 57(1) of the Patent Act states as follows:\nInjunction may issue\nInterdiction\n57. (1) In any action for infringement of a patent, the court, or any judge thereof, may, on the application of the plaintiff or defendant, make such order as the court or judge sees fit,\n57. (1) Dans toute action en contrefa\u00e7on de brevet, le tribunal, ou l\u2019un de ses juges, peut, sur requ\u00eate du plaignant ou du d\u00e9fendeur, rendre l\u2019ordonnance qu\u2019il juge \u00e0 propos de rendre :\n(a) restraining or enjoining the opposite party from further use, manufacture or sale of the subject-matter of the patent, and for his punishment in the event of disobedience of that order, or\na) pour interdire ou d\u00e9fendre \u00e0 la partie adverse de continuer \u00e0 exploiter, fabriquer ou vendre l\u2019article qui fait l\u2019objet du brevet, et pour prescrire la peine \u00e0 subir dans le cas de d\u00e9sob\u00e9issance \u00e0 cette ordonnance;\n(b) for and respecting inspection or account,\nb) pour les fins et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019inspection ou du r\u00e8glement de comptes,\nand generally, respecting the proceedings in the action\net d\u2019une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, quant aux proc\u00e9dures de l\u2019action.\n[96] Courts may award both an interlocutory accounting of profits (typically in place of an interlocutory injunction) and a final accounting of profits. A final accounting is often coupled with a permanent injunction when the patent is still in force: see Apotex Inc. v. Bayer Inc., 2018 FCA 32, [2018] 4 F.C.R. 58 at para. 66 [Bayer], citing Vidi v. Smith (1854), 118 E.R. 1404, 3 El. & Bl. 969 (U.K.Q.B.); Beloit Canada Ltd. v. Valmet-Dominion Inc., [1997] 3 FC 497, 73 C.P.R. (3d) 321 (F.C.A.) [Beloit FCA 1997].\n[97] An accounting of profits, under paragraph 57(1)(b) of the Patent Act, unlike a damages award, is not compensatory. Instead, an accounting of profits focuses on the profits wrongfully earned by the infringer and not on the losses suffered by the plaintiff. It requires the infringer to disgorge to the plaintiff the profits the infringer earned by reason of the infringement. As the Supeme Court explained in Nova Chemicals, at paragraph 47, the accounting of profits remedy is a necessary tool to deter infringement, especially by those who could make profits in excess of the damages they would cause to a patent holder. Without the availability of the remedy of an accounting of profits, infringers who stand to make substantial profits could be tempted to deliberately infringe a patent if they stood to earn sums that exceed their damages exposure. The accounting of profits remedy is therefore an important tool in a court\u2019s arsenal to deter infringement and protect patentees and the patent bargain. The remedy of an accounting of profits may be particularly appropriate in situations where large companies infringe patents owned by much smaller companies or individuals.\n[98] Damages and an accounting of profits are alternate remedies; thus, a wronged plaintiff cannot receive both for the same period: Fox at \u00a7 14:10, citing Betts v. Neilson (1871), L.R. 5 H.L. 1 (H.L.) at 22 and 27; De Vitre v. Betts (1873), L.R. 6 H.L. 319 (H.L.) at 321; United Horse Shoe and Nail Company Limited v. Stewart and Company (1888), 5 R.P.C. 260 (H.L.) at 266; American Braided Wire Company v. Thomson (1890), 7 R.P.C. 152 (C.A.) at 158.\n[99] It is up to a plaintiff to seek an accounting of the infringer\u2019s profits since damages are the default remedy under the Patent Act, and an accounting cannot be awarded by the Court unless a plaintiff elects to seek the remedy: Bayer at para. 34.\n[100] That said, plaintiffs are not automatically entitled to an award for an accounting of profits following an election. As with any equitable remedy, a court possesses the discretion to decline to award an accounting of profits where it would be inequitable to make the award: see, regarding discretion to award equitable remedies generally, Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada, 2002 SCC 79, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 245 at para. 107[Wewaykum], citing Frame v. Smith, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 99, 42 D.L.R. (4th) 81, at 144; Canson Enterprises Ltd. v. Boughton & Co., [1991] 3 S.C.R. 534, 85 D.L.R. (4th) 129, at 589; Performance Industries Ltd. v. Sylvan Lake Golf & Tennis Club Ltd., 2002 SCC 19, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 678 at para. 66; and regarding discretion to award an accounting of profits in the case of patent infringement, more particularly: Lubrizol Corp. v. Imperial Oil Ltd., [1992] F.C.J. No. 1110, 98 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (F.C.A.) at para. 69; Unilever at para. 183; Beloit FCA 1997 at 545; Marlboro FCA at paras. 8-10; Bayer Aktiengesellschaft and Miles Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc., [2002] O.J. No. 193, 16 C.P.R. (4th) 417 at paras. 13\u201314 (ONCA).\n[101] A court\u2019s discretion in this regard applies not only to the availability of the remedy, but also to its terms, such as the duration of its application: McGuiness Abrams, Canadian Civil Procedure Law, 2nd ed. (Lexis QuickLaw, 2010) at \u00a72.32.\n[102] The discretionary nature of the award of an accounting of profits is recognized in the wording used in paragraph 57(1)(b) of the Patent Act, itself, which provides that a court \u201cmay\u201d make \u201csuch order as the court \u2026 sees fit\u201d for an account. By virtue of the breadth of this wording, this Court held in Beloit FCA 1997 that a court is not obliged to rely on the maxims of equity in order to deny a successful plaintiff its election of an accounting of profits: at 547.\n[103] However, this does not mean that a trial judge may arbitrarily deny the remedy. As Justice Pelletier of this Court found in Apotex Inc. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 2003 FCA 263, [2003] F.C.J. No. 960 [Bristol-Myers] at paragraph 14:\nThe fact that equitable remedies are discretionary means that the respondent cannot elect an accounting of profits as of right. That said, a discretionary remedy is not an arbitrary remedy. In the absence of proof of a bar to equitable relief, a claimant can expect to be granted the remedy it seeks in accordance with the principles governing its availability. Nor does the issue of a bar to equitable relief require the claimant to disprove every ground which could possibly disentitle it to that relief. It is not open to a party to argue that its opponent has not sufficiently disproven a given bar. All this to say that there is no reason why the issue of the respondent's right to elect an accounting of profits cannot be dealt with in the liability portion of the trial. The appellant having denied that it relies upon particular facts to say that the respondent is not entitled to an accounting, the trial judge can deal with the question of entitlement on the basis of the respondent's own evidence. [Emphasis added.]\n[104] In a somewhat similar vein, according to one commentator, the discretion to deny or award an equitable remedy such as accounting of profits does not refer to a judge\u2019s personal discretion or mean unfettered, unbridled discretion to do what the judge feels is best. Rather, as the legal scholar Karl Llewellyn once wrote, judicial discretion should be exercised with \u201creasoned regularity\u2026In exercising judicial discretion, as opposed to personal discretion, courts apply established principles of equity to the facts presented by the particular case\u201d: Karl Llewellyn, The Common Law Tradition: Deciding Appeals (Little, Brown & Co., 1960) at 216.\n[105] In other words, despite the discretionary nature of equitable remedies such as an accounting of profits, they should not be denied arbitrarily. Reasoned regularity is expected from the court in its exercise of discretion in deciding whether to award the remedy.\n[106] Professor Norman Siebrasse has noted that, for several decades, an accounting of profits has been the dominant monetary remedy for patent infringement in Canada and the Commonwealth: see Norman Siebrasse et al., \u201cAccounting of Profits in Intellectual Property Cases in Canada (2007)\u201d, (2008), 24 Canadian Intellectual Property Review 83 at 85 (recently cited with approval by the Supreme Court in Nova Chemicals at para. 37).\n[107] Even though plaintiffs are not entitled to an accounting of profits as of right (see Bristol-Myers at para. 14), this Court has held that compelling reasons are required to deny the remedy. In Marlboro FCA, this Court agreed with Chief Justice de Montigny, then of the Federal Court, that a court needs \u201c\u2026 to \u2018weigh the relevant factors in light of the equitable purposes of the remedy, bearing in mind that the [respondents] have no right to an accounting of profits but that they should not be denied that option in the absence of any compelling reasons\u2019\u201d: see Marlboro FCA at para. 8 (emphasis added), citing to Philip Morris Products S.A. v. Malboro Canada Limited, 2015 FC 364, [2015] F.C.J. No. 1564 at para. 21 [Marlboro FC]. While Marlboro FCA involved the infringement of a trademark, the need for compelling reasons to deny accounting of profits applies equally to cases where patents are infringed.\n[108] As to what such compelling reasons might be in an action for patent infringement, the case law sets out some of the instances where an accounting has been refused to a successful plaintiff. Prior to the case at bar, these included situations where:\nthere was delay in the pursuit of the action by the plaintiff or in instituting proceedings once the plaintiff became aware of the infringement: Bayer Inc. v. Cobalt Pharmaceuticals Company, 2016 FC 1192, 142 C.P.R. (4th) 374 at para. 10 [Bayer FC], aff\u2019d 2018 FCA 32, [2018] 4 F.C.R. 58 at para. 68; J.M. Voith GmbH v. Beloit Corp. (1993), 47 C.P.R. (3d) 448, 61 F.T.R. 161 (F.C.T.D.) at 548 [Beloit FC 1993], aff\u2019d on this point in Beloit FCA 1997 at para. 111; Merck & Co., Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2006 FCA 323, [2007] 3 F.C.R. 588, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 31754 (10 May 2007) at para. 129 [Merck FCA];\nthe plaintiff had \u201cunclean hands\u201d in respect of conduct that related directly to the claim for infringement or its conduct of the action: Nova Chemicals at para. 7; Bayer FC at para. 10, citing Varco Canada Ltd. v. Pason Systems Corp., 2013 FC 750, 236 A.C.W.S. (3d) 714 at paras. 403\u2013410; Marlboro FC at paras. 22\u201345, aff\u2019d Marlboro FCA at paras. 3, 23; Merck FCA at para. 129;\nthe infringement complained of occurred when the patent in suit had been declared invalid at first instance (but then later found valid on appeal): Beloit FC 1993, affirmed on this point in Beloit FCA 1997;\nthe calculation of profits was unduly complex as opposed to the assessment of damages, especially where the infringing items were only a very small portion of the product sold by the defendant, making it difficult to arrive at a reliable figure for profits earned via infringement: Eurocopter v. Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limit\u00e9e, 2012 FC 113, 100 C.P.R. (4th) 87 at paras. 406\u2013416, aff\u2019d 2013 FCA 219, 120 C.P.R. (4th) 394; Marlboro FCA at paras. 11\u201314;\nthe plaintiff was a non-exclusive licensee: Domco Industries Ltd. v. Armstrong Cork Canada Ltd. et al. (1980), [1980] 2 F.C. 801, 47 C.P.R. (2d) 1 (F.C.T.D.) at 9-10, aff\u2019d [1981] 2 F.C. 510, (1980) 54 C.P.R. (2d) 155 (F.C.A.), aff\u2019d [1982] 1 S.C.R. 907, 66 C.P.R. (2d) 46 (this point not in issue on the appeals); and\nthe plaintiff did not practice the invention in Canada: Nova Chemicals at para. 7; Frac Shack Inc. v. AFD Petroleum Ltd., 2017 FC 104, at para. 283, rev\u2019d on other grounds 2018 FCA 140, 157 C.P.R. (4th) 195; Human Care Canada Inc. v. Evolution Technologies Inc., 2018 FC 1302 at para. 437, rev\u2019d on other grounds 2019 FCA 209, 167 C.P.R. (4th) 285, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 38846 (9 April 2020).\n[109] However, on the final point, this Court recently held in Seedlings Life Science Ventures, LLC v. Pfizer Canada ULC, 2021 FCA 154, 339 A.C.W.S. (3d) 69 [Seedlings] that the mere fact that a patentee licences or intends to licence the patent should not disentitle the plaintiff to an accounting of profits. Writing for the Court, Justice Locke stated at paragraphs 77-79:\nIn the present case, the Federal Court concluded that, even if infringement had been found, an accounting of profits would have been inappropriate. One reason cited by the Federal Court for this conclusion was that Seedlings does not practise the invention, and never had any intention to do so. Instead, it intended to license its invention to another entity. At paragraph 252 of the Reasons, the Federal Court cited several decisions over many decades in support of the statement that \u201cif the patentee made its profits by selling licenses, it should not be entitled to compensation beyond a reasonable royalty.\u201d In response to the concern that denying it the right to elect would ignore the deterrent purpose of an accounting of profits, the Federal Court noted the absence of jurisprudence in which such an argument overcame the fact that the patentee did not practise the invention.\nWith regard to the cases cited at paragraph 252 of the Reasons, I note that three of them concern damages, not accounting for profits, and are therefore not helpful in the present context: Colonial Fastener Co. Ltd. v. Lightning Fastener Co. Ltd. (1936), [1937] S.C.R. 36, at page 45, [1937] 1 D.L.R. 21; Alliedsignal Inc. v. du Pont Canada Inc. (1998), 142 F.T.R. 241, 78 C.P.R. (3d) 1 (F.C.T.D.), at paragraphs 21\u201322, affd (1999), 235 N.R. 185, 86 C.P.R. (3d) 324 (F.C.A.); and JAY-LOR International Inc. v. Penta Farm Systems Ltd., 2007 FC 358, 313 F.T.R. 1, [2007] 4 F.C.R. D-5, at paragraph 119. The other cases focus on the fact that the patentee was not practising the invention, and not necessarily on whether it made profits from licensing. In my view, none of the cited decisions provides firm support for the broad principle that a patentee that makes (or intended to make) profits by selling licences to its patent should not be entitled to elect an accounting of profits.\nI am particularly concerned about the potential effect of such a broadly defined principle on inventors who recognize that their specialty lies in inventing, and that production and marketing of their inventions are better left to different specialists. Such inventors will seek to license third parties to take their inventions to market as a matter of business efficiency. The broadly defined principle would force such inventors to choose between business efficiency and retaining a potential remedy for infringement of their patent rights. The value of a patent would therefore be reduced for specialist inventors. I see no reason to force such a choice. In my view, business efficiency should be encouraged.\n[110] Thus, the fact that the patentee has licenced or intends to licence its patents in Canada, as opposed to itself practicing the invention, is to be afforded no weight in the determination of whether to award an accounting. This is to be contrasted with situations where the plaintiff has made no attempt and has no plans to commercialize the invention. The latter sort of circumstance may well weigh against the award of an accounting of profits.\n[111] It must be noted that the above-listed situations, where an accounting has been denied, are not a complete list of situations where the remedy may be denied. It remains open to a court to deny an accounting in other, new situations where it would be inequitable to make the award: Marlboro FCA at paras. 8, 18; Merck FCA at para. 133.\n[112] Even though a plaintiff ought not be denied an accounting of profits in the absence of compelling reasons, this Court has noted that certain circumstances favour the award of an accounting of profits. The decided cases confirm that these may include circumstances where:\nthe defendant knowingly infringed the patent: Laboratoires Servier, Adir, Oril Industries, Servier Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2008 FC 825, 67 C.P.R. (4th) 241 at para. 509, aff\u2019d 2009 FCA 222, 75 C.P.R. (4th) 443, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 33357 (25 March 2010); Apotex Inc. v. ADIR, 2020 FCA 60, 172 C.P.R. (4th) 1 at para. 120, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 39172 (24 September 2020), citing Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser, 2004 SCC 34, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 902 at para. 95 [ADIR]; Rivett v. Monsanto Canada Inc., 2010 FCA 207, 325 D.L.R. (4th) 107 at para. 32; and\nthe defendant was aware that the plaintiff was likely to enforce the patent: Eli Lilly at para. 655.\n[113] Where a defendant alleges that it should not be liable for damages or be required to disgorge all or part of its profits because it could have adopted a non-infringing alternative, it is incumbent on the defendant to establish that the claimed alternative is a true substitute that could and would have been adopted: see Nova Chemicals at para. 114, citing Merck & Co. Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2015 FCA 171, 387 D.L.R. (4th) 552 at para. 73 [Lovastatin]. In addition, as this Court stated in Apotex Inc. v. Eli Lilly and Company, 2018 FCA 217, 161 C.P.R. (4th) 411 [Apotex 2018], consideration of whether the non\u2011infringing alternative is a true substitute is particularly important in non\u2011pharmaceutical patent infringement cases: this \u201cvery important question... usually turns on whether the product at issue would be considered a true substitute by the consumer\u201d: see para. 54; see also ADIR at paras. 96\u2013100.\n[114] With these general principles in mind, I turn next to assess the various arguments advanced by Rovi.\n(2) Analysis of the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons on Remedy [115] I commence by focussing on the various errors the Federal Court is alleged to have made in its treatment of the request for an accounting of profits.\n(a) Factors Considered Neutral for an Accounting of Profits [116] It will be recalled that Rovi first argues that the Federal Court erred in qualifying as neutral the factors of: (1) lack of delay, (2) Rovi having practiced the inventions claimed in the Patents, and (3) Videotron\u2019s conduct in practicing these inventions. Rovi says all three of these factors should have favoured the award of an accounting of profits.\n[117] I agree with Rovi that the Federal Court erred in its treatment of the factors that it considered when determining whether to award an accounting of profits and find that the Federal Court\u2019s entire approach started from the wrong premise. The Federal Court toted up the factors that it felt favoured awarding an accounting of profits, versus those that it felt disfavoured making such an award. The implicit starting point for the Federal Court\u2019s approach was that there is no prima facie entitlement to an accounting of profits. However, this starting point fails to recognize the need for compelling reasons to deny the remedy of an accounting of profits. Instead of proceeding in this fashion, the Federal Court should have started from the premise that Rovi would be entitled to the requested accounting of profits unless there were sufficient compelling reasons to deny the remedy. When the correct approach is followed, one cannot quantify factors as being \u201cneutral\u201d and then discount them in the way the Federal Court did. Rather, what is required is consideration of whether there were factors which militated against the requested award such that it would have been inequitable to make it.\n(b) Rovi\u2019s Conduct [118] I also agree in part with Rovi\u2019s second argument and find that the Federal Court erred in finding that many aspects of Rovi\u2019s conduct provided a basis for denying the requested accounting of profits.\n[119] In this regard, Rovi\u2019s assertion that there is no duty of good faith applicable to pre\u2011contractual negotiations is not entirely settled in the case law. While such a duty would appear to arise under Articles 1375 and 2085 of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec, ch. CCQ-1991, the issue has not been firmly settled in the common law.\n[120] The Supreme Court of Canada has relatively recently confirmed that there is a duty of good faith in respect of contractual performance in the common law (see especially Wastech Services Ltd. v. Greater Vancouver Sewerage and Drainage District, 2021 SCC 7, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 32; C.M. Callow Inc. v. Zollinger, 2020 SCC 45, [2020] 3 S.C.R. 908; Bhasin v. Hrynew, 2014 SCC 71, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 494). However, that Court has not recognized a general pre\u2011contractual obligation to negotiate an agreement in good faith. The Supreme Court specifically left the question of whether such a duty exists unanswered until \u201canother time\u201d in Martel at paragraph 73.\n[121] I need not decide whether there is a pre-contractual duty of good faith applicable to Videotron and Rovi\u2019s negotiations as, even if such a duty existed, I fail to see how much of Rovi\u2019s conduct that the Federal Court impugned would amount to a breach of any duty to act in good faith or provide any basis for denying an accounting of profits.\n[122] The Federal Court was critical of Rovi\u2019s failure to specifically identify which claims in the Patents in suit it alleged were being violated by Videotron. I fail to see how a duty to so identify the claims could possibly exist when the Patents were publicly available and Videotron was in as good a\u2014if not better\u2014position than Rovi to assess whether Videotron\u2019s own system violated the Patents.\n[123] The Federal Court was also critical of Rovi\u2019s practice of licencing and firmly defending its patents. Once again, there is nothing inappropriate per se in a party\u2019s staunch defence of its perceived patent rights (which is the norm in virtually every case of patent litigation, especially in the pharmaceutical area). Nor is there anything untoward in adopting a business model of licencing, as this Court noted in Seedlings. It may be that what troubled the Federal Court was the stance that Rovi took in the face of the fact that the claims in suit were invalid for obviousness. However, the weakness of the claims could not be a relevant factor in the Court\u2019s consideration of remedy, which was premised on determining what the appropriate remedy would have been had the claims in suit been valid.\n[124] Likewise, I fail to see how declining to send a cease and desist letter could be considered to be a valid reason to deny an accounting of profits. Cease and desist letters are sometimes sent shortly before an action is launched. A defendant is always able to concede when served with a statement of claim and does not depend on the receipt of a cease and desist letter to determine its desired course of conduct. Moreover, in the case at bar, Videotron knew for many years that Rovi wanted a licence renewal and would assert its patents. Indeed, Videotron extended its previous licence with Rovi for a year in order to conduct its own in-depth consideration of the validity of Rovi\u2019s patents. I therefore fail to see what a cease and desist letter would have accomplished. Accordingly, I find that the Federal Court erred in relying on the absence of a cease and desist letter in support of its decision to decline to award an accounting of profits.\n[125] As for the length of time that it took Rovi to prosecute the Patents before the Patent Office, I would not completely foreclose the possibility that this sort of delay could be relevant to refusing an accounting of profits. If there were ever a basis to determine that a plaintiff had unclean hands in seeking to extend the prosecution time to allow a defendant to accumulate profits that the plaintiff would then obtain, such conduct could well be found to be so inequitable as to disentitle the plaintiff to an accounting of profits. The problem though, in the present case, is that the Federal Court had no evidence about normal practice and delays typically seen before the Patent Office, nor about Rovi\u2019s motives in prosecuting the Patents the way it did. Therefore, it was a palpable and overriding error for the Federal Court to have relied in its remedial analysis on the length of time it took to prosecute the Patents before the Patent Office. As Justice Hughes (who had been both a patent lawyer and registered patent agent) noted in Merck & Co v. Apotex Inc., 2006 FC 524, [2006] F.C.J. No. 671, aff\u2019d Merck FCA, \u201c[w]ithout evidence as to what patent prosecution practice is and means in each country this Court cannot draw meaningful inferences as to delay or wilfulness\u201d: at para. 217.\n(c) Complexity of the Calculations for an Accounting of Profits [126] Rovi next alleges that the Federal Court erred in concluding that the complexity of the required calculations was a basis for denying the requested accounting of profits. There is no merit in this submission since it mischaracterizes the Federal Court\u2019s findings. Contrary to what Rovi says, the Federal Court held that an award of an accounting of profits would not have been appropriate because it was not satisfied that using any of the methods proposed by Rovi to calculate Videotron\u2019s profits would allow the Court to arrive at a reliable and appropriate amount.\n[127] This finding was open to the Federal Court in light of the nature of the calculations put forward by Rovi\u2019s expert. These were based on a market reconstruction premised on Rovi\u2019s entire patent portfolio, and not just the claims in suit, and included the profits earned by Videotron relating to cable TV content subscriptions as well as its non-TV lines of business, which did not involve technologies similar to those claimed in the Patents. There was ample basis for the Federal Court to conclude that the methods proposed by Rovi\u2019s experts would not allow the Court to arrive at a reliable and appropriate amount for profits earned by reason of any infringement, had it found the claims valid. There is thus no error in the Federal Court\u2019s treatment of this issue.\n(3) Analysis of the Federal Court\u2019s Reasons on Damages [128] I turn next to Rovi\u2019s arguments concerning the Federal Court\u2019s discussion and quantification of the damages it would have awarded had the claims in suit been valid.\n[129] I agree that the Federal Court erred in basing its provisional damages calculation on the amount that it would have cost Videotron to design around the Patents without first finding what these non-infringing alternatives were, whether Videotron could and would have adopted them, and whether consumers would have accepted them. In Lovastatin, at paragraph 73, this Court held:\nWhen considering the effect of legitimate competition from a defendant marketing a non-infringing alternative, a court is required to consider at least the following questions of fact:\n(i) Is the alleged non-infringing alternative a true substitute and thus a real alternative?\n(ii) Is the alleged non-infringing alternative a true alternative in the sense of being economically viable?\n(iii) At the time of infringement, does the infringer have a sufficient supply of the non-infringing alternative to replace the non-infringing sales? Another way of framing this inquiry is could the infringer have sold the non-infringing alternative?\n(iv) Would the infringer actually have sold the non-infringing alternative? [Emphasis added.]\n[130] As noted, in Apotex 2018 at paragraph 54, this Court stated that the consideration of whether a proposed substitute is a true alternative \u201c[i]n non-pharmaceutical cases \u2026 is a very important question that usually turns on whether the product at issue would be considered a true substitute by the consumer\u201d.\n[131] In the present case, the Federal Court failed to undertake the foregoing analysis and failed to ascertain what the design changes that Videotron posited it could have made were. It also failed to address whether any such changes could and would have been adopted by Videotron and whether they would have been accepted by its customers. The Federal Court erred in law in failing to consider these issues, which are essential components for a finding of a non-infringing alternative that would limit a defendant\u2019s damages exposure.\n[132] As for Rovi\u2019s allegation that the Federal Court erred in failing to consider the amounts paid by Videotron for its previous licencing arrangement with Rovi as the measure of damages, I see no error in the Federal Court\u2019s adoption of a reasonable royalty analysis given the way the case was argued before the Federal Court. Rovi sought a reasonable royalty as opposed to damages for lost royalty income premised on its previous licence with Videotron. The two are entirely different bases for the damages calculation, as noted above.\n[133] That said, in assessing the reasonable royalty rate, the Federal Court only considered the amount that Videotron would have been willing to pay and not the amount that Rovi would have accepted. As already noted, AlliedSignal provides that a hypothetical reasonable royalty rate must be set based on what rate would have been agreed to by both plaintiff and defendant had they been a willing licensor and willing licensee. The Federal Court accordingly should have considered both parties\u2019 positions (had they been acting as willing contracting parties) in setting the hypothetical reasonable royalty rate.\n[134] Thus, as is apparent from the foregoing, I agree with many of the remedial arguments advanced by Rovi.\nIII. Proposed Disposition [135] While the Federal Court erred in several aspects of its remedial analysis, these errors do not affect the outcome of this appeal. Because there is no basis to interfere with the Federal Court\u2019s obviousness findings that Rovi impugns, I would dismiss this appeal, with costs.\n\u201cMary J.L.

In that judgment, the Federal Court dismissed Rovi\u2019s actions against the respondents, Bell Canada (Bell) and Telus Corporation, Telus Communications Inc., and Telus Communications Company (collectively, Telus) for patent infringement and granted the respondents\u2019 counterclaims for declarations of invalidity and non\u2011infringement in respect of several claims in Rovi\u2019s Canadian Patents Nos. 2,339,629, and 2,425,482, 2,336,870 (the 870 Patent), and 2,514,585 (the 585 Patent).\n[2] Like the patents at issue in the companion appeal that is being released simultaneously with this one, Rovi v. Videotron, 2024 FCA 125 (A-186-22) [Videotron], all four patents in this appeal involve interactive television program guide (IPG) technology: see Videotron at para. 2 for a summary of that technology. The companion appeal deals with claims in one of the same Patents in issue on this appeal, the 870 Patent, and with a different patent (Canadian Patent No. 2,730,344).\n[3] In the present case, like in Videotron, the Federal Court dismissed Rovi\u2019s actions against the respondents for infringement and granted the respondents\u2019 counterclaims for declarations of invalidity. The Court held that all of the asserted claims were invalid because they were either anticipated and\/or obvious, having regard to the prior art and the common general knowledge of the person skilled in the art to which the Patents were directed (the Skilled Person). It also held that some of the claims in suit were not infringed. While this was sufficient to dismiss Rovi\u2019s actions and to grant the respondents\u2019 counterclaims, like in Videotron, the Federal Court went on to reach conclusions about the appropriate remedy for completeness sake. The Court concluded that, had the claims in suit been valid and infringed, Rovi would not have been entitled to an accounting of profits or to an injunction.\n[4] Rovi appeals some of the Federal Court\u2019s findings with respect to the 870 Patent and the 585 Patent, but not the findings in respect of the other two patents that were at issue before the Federal Court. Before us, Rovi argues that the Federal Court made reviewable errors in its obviousness analysis in respect of the 870 Patent and the 585 Patent and in its anticipation analysis in respect of the 585 Patent. It also asserts that the Federal Court made reviewable errors in its remedial analysis.\n[5] For the reasons that follow, I find that the Federal Court did not make any reviewable errors in its obviousness analysis in respect of the 870 Patent or in its anticipation analysis concerning the 585 Patent. Therefore, it is unnecessary to address its findings on the obviousness of the 585 Patent. However, like in Videotron, some of the Federal Court\u2019s provisional findings regarding remedy require correction by this Court. The required correction does not affect the disposition of this appeal, which I would dismiss with costs.\nI. The 870 Patent and the 585 Patent [6] Details about the 870 Patent are provided in Videotron, starting at paragraph 7 of that decision.\n[7] At trial in the present case, Rovi asserted that the respondents infringed two groups of claims in the 870 Patent, Claim 346, which was referred to by the parties as the \u201c870A Claim\u201d, and Claims 456, 721, and 724, which were referred to by the parties as the \u201c870C Claims\u201d. Only the Federal Court\u2019s findings with respect of the 870C Claims are being appealed.\n[8] The 870C Claims relate to peer-to-peer transmission. The 870C Claims in the 870 Patent, along with the additional claims that some of them depend on, are set out in the Appendix to these Reasons. Two of the 870C Claims, Claims 456 and 721, were at issue in Videotron, which upheld the Federal Court\u2019s finding that these Claims are obvious.\n[9] The 585 Patent was filed on January 30, 2004, expired on January 30, 2024, and claims a priority date of January 30, 2003, which the Federal Court accepted as appropriate. Entitled \u201cInteractive Television Systems with Digital Video Recording and Adjustable Reminders\u201d, the 585 Patent relates to operator-initiated recordings and the ability to restart a program that a user is currently watching or a program that was previously broadcast.\n[10] There are four claims at issue on appeal in the 585 Patent\u2014Claims 34, 36, 87 and 127. These Claims include both system and method claims. They, too, are reproduced in the Appendix to these Reasons, along with the additional claims on which some of them depend.\nII. The Reasons of the Federal Court [11] In reviewing the Federal Court\u2019s Decision, I focus only on those portions that are relevant to the issues that Rovi has raised on this appeal that are considered in these Reasons.\nA. The Federal Court\u2019s Validity Findings [12] I commence with the Federal Court\u2019s consideration of obviousness of the 870C Claims in the 870 Patent. In undertaking its obviousness analysis, the Federal Court set out the following test for assessing obviousness at paragraph 151 of its Decision:\na) Identify the notional Skilled Person and the relevant [common general knowledge] of that person;\nb) Identify the inventive concept of the claim, or if that cannot readily be done, construe it;\nc) Identify what, if any, differences exist between the matter cited as forming part of the \u201cstate of the art\u201d and the inventive concept of the claim or the claim as construed; and\nd) If the differences constitute steps which would have been obvious to the Skilled Person, the claim is obvious and invalid.\n[13] This wording is slightly different from that used by the Supreme Court of Canada in Apotex Inc. v. Sanofi-Synthelabo Canada Inc., 2008 SCC 61, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 265 [Sanofi], at paragraph 67, where the Supreme Court described the test for assessing whether a patent is obvious as follows:\n(1) (a) Identify the notional \u201cperson skilled in the art\u201d;\n(b) Identify the relevant common general knowledge of that person;\n(2) Identify the inventive concept of the claim in question or if that cannot readily be done, construe it;\n(3) Identify what, if any, differences exist between the matter cited as forming part of the \u201cstate of the art\u201d and the inventive concept of the claim or the claim as construed;\n(4) Viewed without any knowledge of the alleged invention as claimed, do those differences constitute steps which would have been obvious to the person skilled in the art or do they require any degree of invention?\n[14] As will soon become apparent, in my view, nothing turns on the slightly different wording used by the Federal Court in this case to describe the test for obviousness.\n[15] Like in the companion appeal, Rovi does not challenge the Federal Court\u2019s findings under the first step of the Sanofi analysis regarding the attributes of the Skilled Person for the two Patents at issue in this appeal. As a result, no more needs to be said about the first step in the obviousness analysis.\n[16] On the second step in the Sanofi analysis, the Federal Court held that the common general knowledge of the Skilled Person prior to the filing dates applicable to all of the patents in suit included knowledge of the following:\na) A television system typically includes a headend (a central location run by the operator, which collects multimedia from content providers and processes it for distribution), and customer premises equipment (such as a television sometimes with a STB [or set top box], which receives the television content and displays it to the user).\nb) EPGs [or electronic program guides, a term that was used by the parties interchangeably with IPGs] and their provision to and storage of information of television program data by an STB.\nc) The STB could be controlled by the user by way of a remote control.\nd) Up to the mid-1990s, most television content was transmitted to users in analog format.\ne) The development and widespread adoption of digital transmission, compression and storage techniques in the mid-1990s changed the ability to provide a richer interactive television experience to users.\nf) The Internet digitally connected users across the globe, allowing them to exchange messages, play games, and view various types of multimedia (including pictures, music, and video).\ng) In March 1998, DAVIC released version 1.3.1 of its specification, which consists of 14 parts.\n[Federal Court Decision at para. 168].\n[17] I note, parenthetically, that the dates for assessing obviousness in respect of the 870 Patent and the 585 Patent are their respective priority dates in accordance with sections 28.1 and 28.3 of the Patent Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. P-4 [Patent Act]. However, nothing turns on the Federal Court\u2019s apparent focus in paragraph 168 of its reasons on the Skilled Person\u2019s common general knowledge prior to the filing dates of the patents in suit.\n[18] DAVIC 1.3.1, mentioned by the Federal Court as forming part of that common general knowledge, was a document published by the Digital Audio-Visual Council (the Council) in 1998, entitled \u201cDAVIC 1.3.1 Specification Part 1\u201d (DAVIC). As summarized in Videotron:\n\u2026 the Council was a non-profit organization based in Switzerland. To quote from the Foreword of DAVIC, the Council\u2019s objective was \u201c\u2026to promote the success of interactive digital audio-visual applications and services through the specification of open interfaces and protocols\u201d. DAVIC was the culmination of a multi-year consultation process with equipment manufacturers, service providers, government organizations, and non-members of the Council. As stated in its introduction, DAVIC \u201c\u2026 defines the minimum tools and dynamic behaviour required by digital audio-visual systems for end-to-end interoperability across countries, applications, and services\u201d.\n[Videotron at para. 12].\n[19] With respect to the Claims in suit in the 870 Patent, more particularly, the Federal Court found that the 870 Patent, itself, admits that \u201cIPGs were known\u201d and that \u201cIPGs that have digital storage devices were known\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 239. Further, the Federal Court found that, by July 1998, the common general knowledge of the Skilled Person included:\nA. how to integrate an IPG into an interactive television system that allows users to store programs on an independent storage device;\nB. digital storage devices such as hard disk drives and recordable DVD\u2019s could be used to record broadcast TV; and\nC. use of a digital storage device to record broadcast programs by connecting the device to a STB using an appropriate interface.\n[Federal Court Decision at para. 240].\n[20] The Federal Court also found that although home networking was not widespread, the parties\u2019 experts generally agreed that home networking was known by 1998: Federal Court Decision at para. 267.\n[21] As concerns the third part of the Sanofi test, relating to the inventive concept of the claims in the 870 Patent, the Federal Court made several claim-specific findings. According to the Federal Court, the inventive concept of Claim 456 comprised three elements, namely: (1) generating a request to playback a broadcast program with a first user equipment; (2) wherein the broadcast program was recorded on a second user equipment in response to a record request generated at the second user equipment; and (3) in response to the playback request from the first user equipment, receiving with the first user equipment the broadcast program from the second user equipment, and generating for display the received program: Federal Court Decision at para. 270.\n[22] The Court found the inventive concept of Claims 721 and 724 included the same foregoing three elements, as well as the following additional three features: (4) both the transmitting and receiving user equipment be connected to a display; (5) the program recorded and transmitted be a broadcast program; and (6) recording the program on the first user equipment with media guidance data associated with the program: Federal Court Decision at para. 271.\n[23] After undertaking a comparative analysis between the 870C Claims in the 870 Patent and the state of the art under the Sanofi framework, the Court found the inventive concept of all the Claims in suit was obvious in light of the common general knowledge of the Skilled Person and the home networking references in DAVIC, and in particular, section 7.2 of DAVIC. Section 7.2 of DAVIC provided:\nAs multiple digital services begin to penetrate the consumer market, the need will arise for an in-home digital network that will provide selectable access to these services from multiple in-home devices. Furthermore, the introduction of digital storage devices in the home will expand this need. Home networks for DAVIC must support the functions required to link digital consumer devices so that information may be exchanged among these devices in a simple and direct manner.\n[Federal Court Decision at para. 265].\n[24] According to the Federal Court, DAVIC \u201cexplicitly describe[d]\u201d home networking: Federal Court Decision at para. 277. The Court accepted the evidence of the respondents\u2019 expert, Mr. Kerr, that DAVIC recognized that \u201chome networks for DAVIC must support the functions required to link digital consumer devices so that information may be exchanged among these devices in a simple and direct manner\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 277. This included comprehensive requirements for any communications between two user devices like STBs to transfer recorded broadcast programs from one STB to another and to display requested programs on the receiving user\u2019s device.\n[25] More specifically, the Federal Court found that the common general knowledge and DAVIC rendered all of the 870C Claims obvious, as follows:\n(a) Elements 1 and 2 were obvious: DAVIC 1.3.1 taught the Skilled Person how to implement a home network, and required that DAVIC systems support connections between user equipment such that information such as video could be exchanged between them.\n(b) Element 3 was obvious: DAVIC 1.3.1 taught a method that allowed a user to transmit requests for and then receive recorded broadcast programs. DAVIC 1.3.1 also taught that the requested programs can be displayed on a receiving user\u2019s television.\n(c) Element 4 was obvious: DAVIC 1.3.1 taught that this communication could include transmission of video between devices and that the devices connected in the network could include multiple displays.\n(d) Element 5 was obvious: DAVIC 1.3.1 taught recording broadcast programs to a local digital storage device \u2013 for example, DAVIC 1.3.1 described a STB coupled to a \u201cdigital video recorder\u201d which was a display.\n(e) Element 6 was obvious: DAVIC 1.3.1 taught that if a program was stored in the user\u2019s equipment, the user must be able to locate and view information about the program to select the item and play it back.\n[Federal Court Decision at para. 286].\n[26] The Federal Court ultimately concluded that the 870C Claims \u201cprovide nothing more than an idea that was already being targeted by DAVIC\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 282.\n[27] The Federal Court went on to find that another piece of prior art, \u201cSystem for Transmitting Desired Digital Video or Audio Signals\u201d (U.S. Patent No. 5,675,734) (Hair), when considered together with the common general knowledge of the Skilled Person, also rendered all of the 870C Claims obvious: Federal Court Decision at paras. 287-295. There is no need to review the Federal Court\u2019s findings in respect of Hair as I have concluded, for many of the same reasons as in Videotron, that the Federal Court did not make a reviewable error in finding that DAVIC rendered the claims in suit in the 870 Patent obvious.\n[28] Turning now to the 585 Patent, the Federal Court noted that, with one exception, the parties agreed on the construction of Claims 34, 35, 87, and 127 of the 585 Patent. Accepting the parties\u2019 agreement, the Federal Court found that the essential elements of the claims in suit were as follows:\nClaims 34 and 36 both depend on Claim 33. The essential elements of Claim 33 are:\nElement 1: Providing users access to recordings of broadcast television programs having scheduled start-times and end-times;\nElement 2: Selectively recording, based on retention criteria, a subset of the plurality of broadcast programs on storage of a server remote to the users;\nElement 3: Providing a first user with access to at least a portion of a first recorded broadcast program during a retention-period; and\nElement 4: Removing the recorded first broadcast program at the end of the retention-period.\nClaim 34 depends on Claim 33, and adds the following elements:\nElement 5: Tuning the first user device to the first broadcast program at a tune-time, wherein the tune-time is after the scheduled start-time of the first broadcast program;\nElement 6: Determining that the start-time of the first broadcast program has elapsed; and\nElement 7: In response to determining, accessing the portion of the recorded first broadcast program provided by the remote server at the first user device, wherein the portion corresponds to a portion of the first broadcast program that was broadcasted by the facility prior to the tune-time;\nClaim 36 also depends on Claim 33 and only adds the following elements:\nElement 8: Receiving a request to access the recorded first broadcast program; and\nElement 9: Transmitting the portion of the recorded first broadcast program upon receiving the request.\nBoth parties agree that Claim 87 (which depends on Claim 85) has the same essential elements as Claim 33, but Claim 87 is a system claim, whereas Claim 33 is a method claim.\nBoth parties also agree that Claim 127 (which depends on Claim 125) has the same essential elements as Claims 33 and 87. While Claim 127 uses the word \u201caccess-period,\u201d as opposed to \u201cretention period\u201d (as found in Claim 33), the Skilled Person would understand that there is no difference between an \u201caccess-period\u201d and a \u201cretention-period.\u201d\n[Federal Court Decision at paras. 384-388].\n[29] The one construction issue in dispute concerned the meaning to be given to \u201caccessing\u201d in element 7 of Claim 34. The Federal Court accepted the interpretation advanced by Rovi\u2019s expert, Mr. Wahlers, finding that \u201caccessing\u201d meant \u201cestablishing a connection in preparation for transmission\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 394.\n[30] After discussing the construction issues, the Federal Court moved to validity and, among other things, held that a patent entitled \u201cDigital Interactive Delivery System for TV\/Multimedia\/Internet with On-Demand Applications\u201d (the iMagic Patent), published approximately a year before the priority date of the 585 Patent, anticipated the 585 Patent. The iMagic Patent was owned by iMagic, a Canadian television company, and described an Internet Protocol Television [IPTV] that \u201cinclude[d] various on-demand applications, each of which are accessible on an integrated IPG, and each of which use the same remote video server. Two of those on-demand applications were TimelessTV and VDVR [Virtual Digital Video Recording]\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 404.\n[31] The Federal Court found that Rovi failed to identify anything inventive about the claims in suit in the 585 Patent over the iMagic Patent, and more particularly TimelessTV. Although the respondents initially pled that both of the TimelessTV and VDVR applications anticipated the 585 Claims, the Federal Court limited its findings on anticipation to TimelessTV, which was the focus of the respondents\u2019 submissions at trial: Federal Court Decision at para. 406.\n[32] The Federal Court applied the two-part test to show that prior art anticipates a claimed invention: there must be a prior disclosure of the essential elements of the claim in a single piece of prior art and the prior disclosure must enable the claimed subject-matter to be practised by a Skilled Person without any inventive skill: Federal Court Decision at paras. 149, 320, 407-438.\n[33] The Federal Court found that the respondents had established, on a balance of probabilities, that the iMagic Patent disclosed all of the essential elements of the 585 Claims in suit: Federal Court Decision at para. 432. At paragraph 418 of the Decision, the Federal Court set out a chart, listing each of the essential elements of the claims in suit in the 585 Patent and showing how each of these elements was found in the iMagic Patent. In so holding, the Federal Court relied on the evidence from one of the respondents\u2019 experts, Dr. Robinson, which it found was \u201cunshaken on cross-examination on key matters or left unchallenged\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 417. Conversely, it gave little to no weight to the evidence on anticipation from Rovi\u2019s expert, Mr. Wahlers, whom the Federal Court found \u201ctook astonishing positions in his reports on the 585 Patent and continued to maintain those positions at trial, only to give them up without a fight in cross-examination\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 413. In addition, several key paragraphs in Mr. Wahlers\u2019 report were shown to have been copied from the report of another of Rovi\u2019s experts in the companion appeal, which the Federal Court found substantially undercut Mr. Wahlers\u2019 credibility.\n[34] The Federal Court also found that iMagic was enabling. According to the Court, all the experts agreed that \u201ciMagic is far more technical and detailed than the 585 Patent\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 433.\n[35] The Federal Court accordingly concluded that iMagic anticipated the claims in suit in the 585 Patent.\nB. The Federal Court\u2019s Findings on Remedy [36] I turn next to summarize the Federal Court\u2019s findings regarding remedy.\n[37] As already noted, even though the Federal Court dismissed Rovi\u2019s action and granted the respondents\u2019 counterclaims, it went on to make findings on remedy for the sake of completeness. The Federal Court held that, had the Patents been valid, Rovi would not have been entitled to an accounting of profits or to an injunction and that damages would have been the appropriate remedy: Federal Court Decision at paras. 643, 654.\n[38] The Federal Court found that the factors relevant to denying an award of an accounting of profits in this case included: (i) the complexity and the practical difficulties of an accounting of profits; (ii) Rovi\u2019s conduct; (iii) the good faith of the respondents; and (iv) whether Rovi did not compete with the respondents or routinely licenced its patents: Federal Court Decision at para. 587.\n[39] The Federal Court first assessed the factor of complexity and noted that \u201c\u2026serious practical difficulties can be encountered by the Court in the determination of profits, and it is desirable that a trial judge consider the practical consequences of ordering this remedy in a particular case [\u2026]\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 591, quoting AlliedSignal Inc. v. Du Pont Canada Inc., [1995] F.C.J. No. 744, 61 C.P.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.) at para. 81, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 24781 (30 November 1995).\n[40] In this case, the Federal Court found that \u201cIPTV is an enormously complex product, requiring complex software, extensive hardware, a massive network of fibre-optic cable, and teams of thousands of people to develop, launch and maintain. The asserted patented features are a small part of the software, which in itself is a small part of the overall product of the [respondents\u2019] services\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 597. Given this, the Court further found that \u201cisolating the impact of the individual features at issue in this case, while not impossible, would prove extremely challenging\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 598. This complexity, according to the Court, did not militate in favour of granting the remedy of an accounting of profits: Federal Court Decision at para. 602.\n[41] On the factor of Rovi\u2019s conduct, like in Videotron, the Federal Court found that the length of time that Rovi took to prosecute the Patents before the Patent Office and Rovi\u2019s dealings with the respondents both militated against awarding an accounting of profits: Federal Court Decision at paras. 605-627.\n[42] In this appeal, however, the Federal Court went further and found that this case exemplified a \u201cpatent holdup\u201d problem: Federal Court Decision at para. 627. According to the Court:\nWhen considered as a whole, the clear pattern of delay and the late amendments to some of its patents leads inexorably to the conclusion that delay in prosecution of the Patents was a deliberate and integral part of Rovi\u2019s business strategy. Notably, over the course of the licensing negotiation, Rovi did not mention the 482 Patent or the 585 Patent to Bell or TELUS. Nor did it mention the 870 Patent to Bell, and only raised claims of the 629 Patent, which are not asserted in these proceedings. Rovi\u2019s delay in issuing the Patents and its sly conduct during negotiations allowed Bell and TELUS to fully integrate the allegedly patented technology into their IPTV systems, and gain millions of customers, before many of the asserted claims existed, let alone before the Patents were issued.\nA similar strategy is employed by patent assertion entities (PAEs), businesses that acquire patents from third parties and seek to extract more than the inherent value of the supposed invention. That is because, in an ex-ante negotiation, a potential licensor will pay only the value of the patented technology. However, in an ex-post negotiation, once the technology has been integrated, the licensor can extract not only the value of the invention, but all of the additional costs that stem from redesigning a system to remove the technology.\nBy failing to prosecute their Patents diligently, Rovi left the [respondents] in the invidious position of not knowing which patents were allegedly infringed, while they attempted to maximize the value of their patented technology. During that period when the Patents were pending, because the letters patent were not issued, the [respondents] were unable to take any action to have the Patents declared invalid pursuant to subsection 60(1) of the Patent Act. Rovi's attempt to \u201cgame the system\u201d goes against the restitutionary purpose of an accounting of profits. The goal of the Patent system, through a grant of a temporary monopoly, is to \u201cencourage invention and to regulate the issuance of patents in Canada\u201d (Genecor International Inc v Canada (Commissioner of Patents), 2008 FC 608 at para 39; Pope Appliance Corp v Spanish River Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd, [1929] A.C. 269 cited in CertainTeed Corp v Canada (Attorney General), 2006 FC 436 at para 25. An unreasonable and unexplained delay in prosecuting the Patents prejudices the public and stifles the innovation envisioned by the patent system.\nDr. Bazelon agreed that \u201cpatent holdup\u201d occurs when a patent owner takes advantage of the potential infringer\u2019s reduced flexibility after they have launched a product and opportunistically tries to extract a larger unreasonable licensing fee, especially using the threat of an injunction. This strategy has been described as engaging in \u201cpre-litigation conduct [\u2026] designed to place the infringer in the most disadvantageous bargaining position\u201d; and delaying \u201cso that the infringer\u2019s dependency on the patent is maximized, as is the proportion of profits claimed.\u201d: Jeff Berryman, Comment on Norman Siebrasse, Business Method Patents and PatentTrolls, 54 CAN. Bus. L.J. 58 (2013) Vol. 54, 58-67, at 66.\nThe case before me exemplifies the \u201cpatent holdup\u201d problem. Rovi\u2019s conduct in this case militates strongly against granting the equitable remedy of an accounting of profits as it would create an incentive for licensing entities to imitate Rovi\u2019s conduct.\n[Federal Court Decision at paras. 623-627].\n[43] The Federal Court stated that Rovi\u2019s conduct, alone, was a compelling reason to deny the right to elect an accounting of profits: Federal Court Decision at para. 643.\n[44] On the respondents\u2019 conduct, the Federal Court found that there was no evidence of any wilful infringement by the respondents in this case that would call for deterrent measures: Federal Court Decision at para. 636. According to the Court, the respondents behaved responsibly in their dealings with Rovi and their conduct was beyond reproach: Federal Court Decision at para. 635.\n[45] Overall, after weighing the above factors, the Federal Court found that it would not have been inclined to exercise its discretion in favour of Rovi. The Federal Court accordingly determined that, had the patents in suit been valid and infringed, it would not have been appropriate to award an accounting of profits.\n[46] The Federal Court held that it also would have declined to exercise its discretion in favour of Rovi to grant injunctive relief. Although the Court acknowledged that an injunction is presumptively available where a plaintiff\u2019s patents have been infringed, the Court found that it was within the discretion of the Court to decline or to grant: Federal Court Decision at paras. 645-646, citing Eurocopter v. Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Lt\u00e9e, 2012 FC 113, [2012] F.C.J. No. 107 at paras. 397-398, 410 [Eurocopter]; JM Voith GmbH v. Beloit Corp., [1997] 3 FC 497, [1997] F.C.J. No. 486 (C.A.) at para. 108; Patent Act, s. 57. According to the Court, certain factors may limit the availability of injunctions, including delay, lack of clean hands, unconscionability and triviality, relying on Eurocopter at para. 397; Janssen-Ortho Inc. v. Novopharm Ltd., 2006 FC 1234, [2006] F.C.J. No. 1535 at para. 132, aff\u2019d 2007 FCA 214, [2007] F.C.J. No. 809, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 32200 (6 December 2007).\n[47] The Federal Court held that patent holdup is also relevant when a court is considering whether to award an injunction. The Court stated that \u201can opportunistic patent holder can try and extract a larger, unreasonable licensing fee especially in light of a potential injunction\u201d and that \u201cthe abusive nature of this strategy has been recognized by Canadian commentators, United States commentators, and the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 648.\n[48] The Court went on to consider a U.S. case, eBay Inc. v. Merc-Exchange, LLC, 547 US 388 (2006) [eBay] and Canadian doctrine that suggested that there were lessons in the eBay case for Canadian courts. In eBay, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy issued a concurring opinion in which he discussed the emergence of a new industry in the United States, in which firms use patents not as a basis for producing and selling goods but, instead, primarily for obtaining licensing fees. Justice Kennedy expressed the view that for firms that use patents primarily for obtaining licensing fees, damages may well be sufficient to compensate for the infringement in certain cases, and that injunctions may not always be in the public interest. According to him, \u201cthe potential vagueness and suspect validity of some of these patents may affect the calculus under the four-factor test\u201d: see Federal Court Decision at para. 649 for an excerpt of Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion.\n[49] Citing to a 2012 paper by Professor Jeff Berryman, the Federal Court found that there were similarities to the context set out in Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion and the instant case. The Federal Court found:\nIn his paper entitled \u201cWhen Will a Permanent Injunction be Granted in Canada for Intellectual Property Infringement? The Influence of eBay v. Merc-Exchange\u201d (2012) 24 Intellectual Property Journal 159, Professor Jeff Berryman argues that there are lessons to be learned from the eBay decision at page 175.\neBay demonstrates that it is possible to have a consistent test across all spectrums of intellectual property concerning the availability of permanent injunctions. That test is openly a balancing one and contemplates that an injunction can be declined even if it means that the plaintiff is left to a damages remedy amounting to a form of compulsory license. U.S. experience also demonstrates that abandoning categorical tests does not dramatically change the landscape. The U.S. approach has the advantage that it provides flexibility toward the granting of one of the court\u2019s most coercive remedies: a permanent injunction. The need for flexibility is demonstrated with the advent of patent trolls. Under the U.S. approach, the power to use an injunction to maximize exploitative advantage is weakened. (Citation omitted)\nI agree with Professor Berryman\u2019s comments and consider it appropriate to adopt the US approach here. As I stated earlier, the present case exemplifies the patent holdup problem. To grant an injunction on the particular facts of this case would be signalling that this Court finds Rovi\u2019s business practice to be acceptable and create an incentive for licensing entities to imitate Rovi\u2019s conduct.\n[Federal Court Decision at paras. 650-651, emphasis added].\n[50] After finding that the U.S. approach should be adopted, the Federal Court made two key findings as to why an injunction would not be appropriate in this case:\nThe evidence before me is that Rovi does not compete with Bell and TELUS. Rovi admits that it cannot deliver IPTV to Canadian customers and routinely licences its patents in Canada. It is effectively a non-practising entity in Canada. In my view, it would be inequitable to prevent Bell and TELUS from providing IPTV products which do not compete with Rovi and it is not in the public interest to deny millions of their customers access to features they previously enjoyed. The imminent expiry of the 585 Patents is a further reason to not impose the costs of modifying Bell and TELUS\u2019 systems to comply with an injunction, when such modifications would be for a short period of time.\nIn this case, good policy and the equities are aligned. Engaging in patent holdup is a business practice this Court should not condone and the Canadian patent system should not be creating incentives for such unfair practices to occur. There was no improper conduct on the part of Bell and TELUS which requires sanction, while to grant an injunction would run a very serious risk of rewarding Rovi\u2019s delay through overcompensation.\n[Federal Court Decision at paras. 652-653].\nIII. Analysis [51] I turn next to evaluate the various arguments that Rovi advances before this Court that are necessary for this Court to consider.\nA. Did the Federal Court Err in its Handling of Mr. Wahlers\u2019 Evidence? [52] It is convenient to first deal with Rovi\u2019s arguments regarding the Federal Court\u2019s treatment of Mr. Wahlers\u2019 evidence as the Federal Court\u2019s findings on anticipation and obviousness at issue in this appeal rely in part on the Federal Court\u2019s decision to give little weight to Mr. Wahlers\u2019 evidence.\n[53] Rovi makes a number of arguments challenging the Federal Court\u2019s findings that: (1) portions of Mr. Wahlers\u2019 report had been written by counsel because they were identical to sections in the report tendered by another expert on behalf of Rovi in the companion appeal; and (2) the failure to acknowledge this undercut Mr. Wahlers\u2019 credibility.\n[54] Rovi first argues on this point that the summary document showing the identical sections in the two reports, relied on by the respondents in their cross-examination of Mr. Wahlers, was premised on an expert report in Videotron that was not in evidence at trial in this case. Rovi contends that the summary document was therefore hearsay and that it was improper for counsel for the respondents to have used it in his cross-examination of Mr. Wahlers.\n[55] Rovi next says that the respondents failed to provide any notice of their objection to Mr. Wahlers\u2019 evidence in advance of his oral testimony, which they assert is in contravention of Rule 52.5(1) of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106. This provision requires a party to raise any objection to an opposing party\u2019s proposed expert witness that could disqualify the witness from testifying as early as possible in the proceeding. Rovi alleges that this meant that the respondents were required to give Rovi advance notice of their line of questioning regarding the copying.\n[56] Rovi further argues that the Court failed to invite any submissions on the propriety of the allegation of copying and failed to conduct a voir dire, which it says the Federal Court was required to do prior to allowing the line of questioning to proceed.\n[57] There is no merit whatsoever to any of these arguments for the simple reason that Rovi raised no objection to this line of questioning at trial. It is trite law that evidentiary objections should be made at trial to give the opportunity to other parties to call additional evidence or adjust examinations and so evidence can be scrutinized \u201cat the time it is proffered\u201d: Pfizer Canada v. Apotex, 2014 FCA 54, [2014] F.C.J. No. 224 at para. 9; see also Teva Canada v. Pfizer Canada, 2017 FC 526, 147 C.P.R. (4th) 126 at para. 39; Eli Lilly Canada v. Teva Canada, 2018 FCA 53, 292 A.C.W.S. (3d) 146 at para. 108, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 38077 (8 November 2018). Thus, in a civil case, an objection on appeal will not usually succeed unless the objection was made at the trial: Lam v. Chiu, 2014 BCCA 32, 237 A.C.W.S. (3d) 408 at para. 47; Sidney N. Lederman et al., Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada, 6 th ed. (Markham: LexisNexis, 2014), \u00a7 2.124.\n[58] I also note parenthetically that, even if an objection had been raised, it would not have been necessary for the Federal Court to have conducted a voir dire or for advance notice to have been given by the respondents as to their intended line of questioning. In a civil case, a voir dire is rare, and, especially in the absence of a jury, there appears to be little reason to conduct one. As for Rule 52.5(1), it applies only where a party seeks to disqualify a witness as opposed to raising issues as to the credibility of that witness in cross-examination. It was largely Mr. Wahlers\u2019 steadfast (and unreasonable) refusal to admit that the paragraphs in question in his report had been wordsmithed by counsel that caused the Federal Court to doubt his credibility. Counsel for the respondents had no way of knowing that such a response would have been given and thus did not know that he would succeed in undercutting Mr. Wahlers\u2019 credibility.\n[59] As an aside, on the practice of counsel assisting in writing or editing sections in expert reports, I endorse the comments of the Federal Court at paragraphs 104-110 of its Decision.\n[60] Rovi next argues that there are \u201conly\u201d twenty examples of copying in Mr. Wahlers\u2019 written evidence, which represented approximately 4% of Mr. Wahlers\u2019 evidence. According to Rovi, this is a critical fact that was not considered by the Federal Court.\n[61] In making this submission, Rovi in essence challenges the Federal Court\u2019s credibility finding relating to Mr. Wahlers, which is reviewable on the deferential palpable and overriding error standard. In light of this standard, I see no reviewable error in the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that counsel impermissibly wrote parts of Mr. Wahlers\u2019 report. In addition, given that Mr. Wahlers failed to admit this in cross-examination, and repeatedly claimed that he, himself, wrote his report alone, coupled with the fact that several paragraphs in the two reports were identical, it was open for the Federal Court to find Mr. Wahlers\u2019 credibility to be in \u201ctatters\u201d, as it did at paragraph 80 of its Decision.\n[62] Thus, it was open to the Federal Court to prefer the evidence of the respondents\u2019 experts over that of Mr. Wahlers, and the Federal Court did not make a reviewable error in so doing.\nB. Standard of Review on Obviousness and Anticipation\n[63] Before delving into Rovi\u2019s arguments on anticipation and obviousness, it is useful to make a few comments on the standard of review.\n[64] Absent an extricable legal error in the test to be applied, a trial court\u2019s findings on anticipation and obviousness can only be overturned if the court made a palpable and overriding error since these findings are factually suffused in nature: Greenblue Urban North America Inc. v. Deeproot Green Infrastructure, LLC, 2023 FCA 184, 2023 A.C.W.S. 6498 at para. 60, citing Abbott Laboratories v. Canada (Minister of Health), 2009 FCA 94, 73 C.P.R. (4th) 444 at para. 24 (on anticipation); SmithKline Beecham Pharma Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2002 FCA 216, 219 D.L.R. (4th) 124 at para. 15, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 29328 (20 March 2003) (on anticipation); Packers Plus Energy Services Inc. v. Essential Energy Services Ltd., 2019 FCA 96, 164 C.P.R. (4th) 191 at para. 29, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 38694 (19 December 2019) (on obviousness); Teva Canada Limited v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2019 FCA 15, 163 C.P.R. (4th) 265 at para. 23 [Pfizer] (on obviousness).\n[65] As set out in Videotron, this Court and the Supreme Court of Canada have underscored on multiple occasions that the palpable and overriding standard is a highly deferential one. \u201cPalpable\u201d means an error that is obvious and \u201coverriding\u201d means that the error affects the outcome. As the Supreme Court put it in Salomon v. Matte-Thompson, 2019 SCC 14, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 729 [Salomon], \u201c[w]here the deferential standard of palpable and overriding error applies, an appellate court can intervene only if there is an obvious error in the trial decision that is determinative of the outcome of the case\u201d: at para. 33, citing Benhaim v. St-Germain, 2016 SCC 48, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 352 at para. 38, quoting Canada v. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 FCA 165, [2012] F.C.J. No. 669 at para. 46, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 34946 (6 December 2012).\n[66] Thus, in a case like the present, it is not the task of this Court in appellate review to sift through and reweigh the evidence the Federal Court used to ground its obviousness findings nor to re-decide which expert is to be preferred: see Pfizer at para. 31; Eli Lilly and Company v. Apotex Inc., 2010 FCA 240, [2010] F.C.J. No. 1199 at para. 8, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 33946 (5 May 2011); E. Mishan & Sons, Inc. v. Supertek Canada Inc., 2015 FCA 163, 134 C.P.R. (4th) 207 at para. 25. As the Supreme Court underscored in Salomon \u201c[t]he fact that an alternative factual finding could be reached based on a different ascription of weight [to the evidence] does not mean a palpable and overriding error has been made\u201d: at para. 33, citing Nelson (City) v. Mowatt, 2017 SCC 8, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 138 at para. 38.\nC. Did the Federal Court Err in Finding the 870C Claims of the 870 Patent Obvious? [67] Bearing these cautions in mind, I turn now to assess Rovi\u2019s arguments relating to the obviousness of the 870C Claims.\n[68] Rovi argues that the Federal Court\u2019s analysis \u201creveals a profound lack of understanding of the obviousness test\u201d: see Rovi\u2019s outline of oral argument at para. 3. It points to the fact that the Federal Court recited an incomplete legal test for assessing obviousness and copied from the respondents\u2019 written closing arguments at trial that omitted the hindsight element. It also says that instead of considering each of the 870C Claims as a whole, the Federal Court erred by relying on the evidence of Mr. Kerr, who broke down the Claims into their constituent steps (elements) and searched, allegedly with hindsight, for each element in DAVIC. Rovi contends that Mr. Kerr \u201ccherry picked\u201d requirements in DAVIC, which contains thousands of possible configurations, steps, and considerations. Rovi also argues that Mr. Kerr failed to provide evidence regarding the Skilled Person\u2019s motivation to combine disparate references in DAVIC to lead to the claimed subject matter.\n[69] Rovi further submits that the Federal Court made a palpable and overriding error regarding playback, an element of the claims in suit, because DAVIC says nothing about playback and Mr. Kerr admitted this during his cross-examination.\n[70] There is no merit to these arguments.\n[71] Although the Federal Court, in setting out the fourth requirement for assessing obviousness from Sanofi, used different words from those used by the Supreme Court, nothing turns on this difference in language. The Federal Court applied the correct test to conclude that the 870C Claims were obvious, finding that they added nothing inventive beyond what was contained in DAVIC, which essentially summarized the Skilled Person\u2019s common general knowledge.\n[72] Before the Federal Court, the parties agreed on the elements of the inventive concept of the 870C Claims, which are listed at paragraphs 270 and 271 of the Federal Court\u2019s Decision. Given this, Rovi cannot contend before us that the Federal Court erred in its enumeration of these elements of the 870C Claims or that Mr. Kerr somehow cherry picked them.\n[73] Nor do I see any reviewable error in the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that DAVIC and the Skilled Person\u2019s common general knowledge rendered the 870C Claims obvious. The Federal Court wrote as follows:\nRovi sought to dismiss DAVIC [\u2026] as nothing more than a high-level conceptual document that does not provide any specific guidance or teaching. In its words, DAVIC [...] is a \u201cpin to a pile of Lego\u201d and a document that \u201ccovers everything, but says almost nothing.\u201d To the contrary, I find that DAVIC [\u2026] represents a snapshot of the [common general knowledge] in the field taken immediately before the filing date of any of the patents at issue.\n[Federal Court Decision at para. 50].\n[74] The Federal Court also specifically rejected Rovi\u2019s argument that DAVIC is \u201cnothing more than a bare list of desired functionality without description or detail as to how to implement that functionality\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 283. To the contrary, it held at paragraph 281 that \u201c\u2026DAVIC had already decided how the so-called \u2018Lego pieces\u2019 should be assembled\u201d.\n[75] I see no reviewable error in these conclusions. There was ample evidence on the record that a Skilled Person could implement the references in DAVIC and that the 870C Claims added nothing to them. Mr. Kerr offered the opinion that the subject matter of each of the 870C Claims were known and in practice by July 1998, and were exemplified by sections in DAVIC. Mr. Wahlers also admitted that several elements of the 870C Claims were known by the priority date of the 870 Patent, as summarized in paragraph 280 of the Federal Court\u2019s Decision.\n[76] Contrary to what Rovi asserts, the Federal Court did not err in its assessment of Mr. Kerr\u2019s evidence on playback. While admitting in cross-examination that the term \u201cplayback\u201d was not used in DAVIC, Mr. Kerr did not concede that DAVIC was silent on the issue. Rather, he stated that playback was encompassed by what DAVIC disclosed as a \u201cdeeper requirement\u201d or \u201canother layer up\u201d. This is precisely what the Federal Court found at paragraph 279 of its Decision. Moreover, in his expert report, Mr. Kerr opined that DAVIC \u201cdescribed a method wherein in response to the playback request from the first user\u2019s equipment, receiving with the first user equipment the broadcast program from the second user equipment, and generating for display the received program.\u201d I accordingly see no error in the Federal Court\u2019s treatment of Mr. Kerr\u2019s evidence.\n[77] In essence, Rovi is asking this Court to re-conduct the obviousness inquiry, and in doing so, it makes before us many of the same arguments it made to the Federal Court. However, as noted at paragraph 80 of Videotron, re-deciding cases is not the role of this Court, which can only intervene if there is an error of law or a palpable and overriding error on a factually suffused question. I see no such error in the way in which the Federal Court conducted a claim-by-claim analysis of obviousness against the state of the art in this case. Paragraph 286 of the Decision clearly sets out why each element of the 870C Claims would have been obvious to the Skilled Person in light of DAVIC. There was ample evidence to support this conclusion.\n[78] Thus, the Federal Court did not err in finding that the 870C Claims were obvious in light of DAVIC and the Skilled Person\u2019s common general knowledge.\nD. Did the Federal Court Err in its Construction of the 585 Patent and in Finding the Claims in Suit Invalid for Anticipation? [79] As for the 585 Patent, Rovi argues that the Federal Court erred in both its construction of the essential elements of the claims in suit and in invalidating those claims for being anticipated by the iMagic Patent.\n[80] On construction, Rovi alleges that the Federal Court made errors in construing Claims 87 and 127 as being the same as Claim 33 or as each other. More specifically, Rovi argues that the Federal Court incorrectly found that the parties agreed that Claims 33, 87 and 127 had a common set of essential elements and that the Federal Court\u2019s false equivalence of these claims resulted in a failure to separately analyze the validity of Claims 87 and 127.\n[81] The respondents, for their part, submit that this is an argument that is being made for the first time on appeal because the parties agreed at trial that Claims 87 and 127 generally had the same essential elements as Claim 33, except that Claim 87 is a system claim, while Claims 33 and 127 are method claims. They add that there was no point at trial where Rovi disputed the respondents\u2019 argument that the essential elements of Claim 33 were the same as Claims 87 and 127, except for the access\/retention period. As noted, the latter issue was resolved in Rovi\u2019s favour.\n[82] To evaluate these arguments, it is important to recall that, although the construction of claims and the construction of the inventive concept are questions of law, the \u201cstandard of review is complicated by the fact that patent claims are interpreted from the point of view of a [person skilled in the art]\u2026 and expert evidence is often considered in determining how such a person would have understood certain terms in a claim at the relevant date\u201d: Eli Lilly Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2024 FCA 72, 2024 CarswellNat 1176 at para. 29. Since the weighing of evidence is a question of mixed fact and law, this Court has cautioned that \u201cwhere the interpretation of a patent claim turns on the weight given to expert evidence, this Court will only intervene where there is a palpable and overriding error\u201d: Google LLC v. Sonos Inc., 2024 FCA 44, [2024] F.C.J. No. 487 at para. 6; see also Tearlab Corporation v. I-MED Pharma Inc., 2019 FCA 179, 166 C.P.R. (4th) 367 at para. 29.\n[83] Here, the Federal Court\u2019s construction turned in large part on the weight given to Dr. Robinson\u2019s expert evidence, which was uncontested by Rovi. Dr. Robinson set out the elements in his expert report: see Appeal Book, Vol. 10, Tab 73 (Robinson Second Report, Volume II) at 18355-18682. There, Dr. Robinson stated:\n51. Claim 87 is a system claim generally involving recording broadcast programs. Claim 87 is broadly similar to claim 33 which I describe above in the table at paragraph 46; however:\n(a) Claim 87 is a system whereas claim 33 is a method; and\n(b) Claim 87 does not require \u201cremoving\u201d the program from storage at the end of the retention-period. Instead, claim 87 only makes programs available during a predefined access-period but does not require the removal of the program after the access-period ends (which accomplishes the same function).\n\u2026\n55. Claim 127 is broadly similar to method claim 33 and system claim 87. The Skilled Person would be mindful of the precise language of each claim, but the overall character of the method claimed is the same between all three claims.\n[84] The record confirms that Mr. Wahlers had no material disagreements with Dr. Robinson\u2019s position on construction of these Claims. At paragraph 53 of his Responding Report, Mr. Wahlers included a comparison table of his assessment of the Skilled Person\u2019s understanding of the subject matter and the 585 asserted Claims with that of Dr. Robinson. In that table, he specifically set out his \u201cpoints of disagreement\u201d with Dr. Robinson: see Appeal Book, Vol 3, Tab 32 (Wahlers\u2019 Responding Report, Table 1, starting at para. 53) at 4870-4884. He identified no disagreements or material differences between his construction and Dr. Robinson\u2019s construction of Claims 33, 87, and 127. Indeed, in that table, Mr. Wahlers repeatedly stated, himself, that any differences between his construction and Dr. Robinson\u2019s were immaterial, except for the meaning of \u201caccessing\u201d in the Claim 34 elements of \u201caccessing the portion of the recorded first broadcast program by the remote server at the first user device, wherein the portion corresponds to the portion of the first broadcast program that was broadcasted by the facility prior to the tune\u2011time\u201d.\n[85] Given that both experts agreed on the construction of these Claims at trial, and Rovi raised no issue with this construction at trial, there can be no palpable and overriding error in the Federal Court\u2019s conclusions regarding the essential elements of Claims 87 and 127. Nor do I see any possible error of law in the Federal Court\u2019s construction of their essential elements, given the similarities between Claims 33, 87, and 127.\n[86] Rovi also argues that the Federal Court wrongly held that the Skilled Person would consider there to be \u201cno difference between an \u2018access-period\u2019 [Claims 87 and 127] and a \u2018retention-period\u2019 [Claim 33]\u201d, where there was no evidence to support that conclusion: Federal Court Decision at para. 388. I do not accept this argument. Although these terms are not defined in the 585 Patent, there was evidence before the Federal Court that the Skilled Person would understand a \u201cretention-period\u201d as the amount of time the operator retains the program to provide access to the user, while the \u201caccess-period\u201d was the amount of time the user has access to the program. On cross-examination, Mr. Wahlers agreed that \u201cimplementation would normally allow the access period and the retention period to be the same\u201d: see Appeal Book, Vol 12, Tab 81, (Wahlers\u2019 Cross, pp.487-89), p. 21684. I see no reviewable error in the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion in light of this evidence and the wording of the claims.\n[87] Beyond claims construction, Rovi also alleges errors in the Federal Court\u2019s validity analysis on anticipation.\n[88] First, Rovi argues that the Federal Court falsely equated Claims 87 and 127 with Claim 33 and that this is \u201cfatal\u201d to the conclusion that Claims 87 and 127 are anticipated. Rovi points to paragraph 400, where the Federal Court states that Mr. Wahlers described the subject matter of the 585 Patent as \u201cthe ability to go back in time and play videos within the near history, such as a day or a week\u201d and argues that the Federal Court, in making this statement, ignored the second part of Mr. Wahlers\u2019 testimony, which distinguished between the different Claims. This, Rovi alleges, is how the Federal Court \u201cfalsely equated claims 87\/127 with claim 33\u201d.\n[89] I disagree that the Federal Court made a reviewable error in setting out the subject matter of the 585 Patent, as it did at paragraph 400 of the Decision. Foremost, it cannot be said that the Federal Court erred given that Mr. Wahlers did describe the 585 Patent in those exact terms at the beginning of his examination in-chief (see: Appeal Book, Vol. 12, Tab 80, (Transcript pp. 297-298), Appeal Book, Vol. 12, p. 21599). On a fair reading of paragraph 400, the Federal Court was simply introducing the concept of the \u201cRestart\u201d function and spoke about the 585 Patent generally, much like Mr. Wahlers did in his testimony. There is therefore no error, let alone a palpable and overriding one.\n[90] Further, while it is clear that Mr. Wahlers testified about the differences between the Claims, it is important to stress that the Federal Court had serious reservations about the reliability of Mr. Wahlers\u2019 expert evidence on the issue of validity and anticipation vis-\u00e0-vis iMagic specifically. The Federal Court found that it had \u201cgreat difficulty with Mr. Wahlers\u2019 evidence, particularly as it relate[d] to the validity of the 585 Patent\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 413. According to the Decision, \u201cMr. Wahlers would obfuscate as he attempted to defend utterly indefensible positions\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 414. According to the Federal Court, Mr. Wahlers\u2019 \u201csometimes incoherent and contradictory responses during cross-examination [brought] into question whether Mr. Wahlers actually read iMagic before he signed his report or knew what he was signing\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 415.\n[91] Although Rovi disputes these findings, the weight that the Federal Court attributed to expert evidence is not reviewable, absent a palpable and overriding error. While Rovi contends that these errors tainted the judge\u2019s findings relating to disclosure and enablement of the 87, 127, and 34 Claims, I disagree. I see no basis for Rovi to challenge the Federal Court\u2019s findings regarding Mr. Wahlers\u2019 evidence and credibility, especially in light of the detailed reasons provided by the Federal Court.\n[92] Rovi next argues that the Federal Court erred in finding disclosure of the Restart Feature in respect of Claim 34. More specifically, in finding that iMagic disclosed Claim 34, Rovi alleges that the Federal Court committed three errors of mixed fact and law. First, Rovi argues that the Federal Court failed to recognize that iMagic discloses two separate applications (TimelessTV and VDVR) that are mutually exclusive. Instead, according to Rovi, the Federal Court impermissibly took select elements from each application to create the \u201cdisclosure\u201d of the novel claim 34 Restart Feature. Second, Rovi argues that the Federal Court failed to recognize that several Claim 34 elements are not disclosed in iMagic. Finally, Rovi contends that the Federal Court erred in reversing Bell and Telus\u2019 burden.\n[93] As to the first of these arguments involving the alleged failure to recognize that iMagic discloses both TimelessTV and VDVR, Rovi contends that both experts agreed on cross-examination that TimelessTV and VDVR could not be used simultaneously. It submits that the respondents\u2019 expert erroneously comingled the two applications in his report and that the respondents, in turn, \u201cimpermissibly comingled the two applications in a chart\u201d. According to Rovi, the Federal Court erred by reproducing that chart at paragraph 418 of its Decision. Yet, Rovi relies on a single reference to the VDVR application contained in the chart at paragraph 418 of the Decision to support its assertion that the Federal Court comingled the two applications. More specifically, focusing on Claim 34 (elements 5, 6 and 7), the chart sets out two iMagic paragraphs, one of which has the \u201cjust in time\u201d recording language bolded. The \u201cjust in time\u201d recording paragraph describes the VDVR application, while the second paragraph just below in the chart describes the separate TimelessTV application.\n[94] As noted, the respondents limited their submissions on anticipation to the disclosures in iMagic regarding TimelessTV: Federal Court Decision at para. 406. The Federal Court nowhere states that it relied on the VDVR application in its analysis. Given this, I disagree that the Federal Court failed to recognize that iMagic discloses two separate applications (TimelessTV and Virtual DVR) that are different.\n[95] As for the second alleged error, which relates to the Federal Court\u2019s claimed failure to recognize that several Claim 34 elements are not disclosed in iMagic, including \u201ctuning\/tune-time, element\u201d, the \u201cstart-time element\u201d, the \u201cdetermining element\u201d, the \u201cresponse to determining element\u201d or the \u201cportion element\u201d, I disagree. Elements 5, 6 and 7, as referenced in the aforementioned chart, speak to these elements and the Federal Court expressly found them to be disclosed. The second paragraph in the chart at paragraph 418 of the Federal Court\u2019s Decision that is taken from the iMagic discussion of the separate TimelessTV application, which can be read as anticipating elements 5, 6 and 7 of Claims 34. I accordingly see no reviewable error in this conclusion.\n[96] Rovi next argues that the Federal Court erred in accepting that iMagic disclosed the 585 Claims and putting it to Rovi to disprove this at paragraph 424 of its Decision. Rovi appears to suggest that in setting out Rovi\u2019s arguments and rejecting them that the Federal Court had presumptively accepted the respondents\u2019 arguments and failed to purposively construe and consider the 585 Claims itself with specific disclosures in iMagic. This argument mischaracterizes the Decision. On a holistic review of the Decision, it is clear that the Federal Court considered both parties\u2019 arguments and ultimately adopted the respondents\u2019 position on iMagic, by including the chart it inserted at paragraph 418 of the Decision. Nowhere did the Federal Court cast the burden on Rovi to prove that the 585 Patent was not anticipated.\n[97] Rovi finally contends that the Federal Court did not conduct a proper enablement analysis. I agree with the respondents that this argument is specious as the Federal Court set out detailed reasons for finding the disclosure in iMagic to be enabling at paragraphs 433 to 438 of the Decision.\n[98] I accordingly find that the Federal Court made none of the errors that Rovi asserts it made. As with its arguments on obviousness, in challenging the Federal Court\u2019s findings on anticipation, Rovi is essentially seeking to reargue its case before this Court. However, as noted, re-deciding cases is not the role of this Court. We cannot intervene in the absence of reviewable error, which Rovi has failed to demonstrate as concerns the Federal Court\u2019 finding that the 585 Patent was anticipated by iMagic.\n[99] There is accordingly no basis to interfere with the Federal Court\u2019s disposition.\nE. Did the Federal Court Err in its Remedial Analysis? [100] While the foregoing conclusion means that this appeal must be dismissed, I believe it is necessary for this Court to address the errors that the Federal Court made in discussing the remedies it would have awarded had the Patents been found valid.\n[101] Rovi alleges that the Federal Court made several errors in principle in its remedial analysis. First, Rovi alleges that the Federal Court erred in holding that Rovi\u2019s alleged misconduct\/delay in patent prosecution was a determinative factor \u201cby itself\u201d to disentitle the election of profits. In its view, the Federal Court conflated Rovi\u2019s (purported) conduct\/delay in patent prosecution with the concept of patent holdup, which it urges is not applicable. Second, Rovi argues that the Federal Court misunderstood key principles for the award of an accounting of profits, which it alleges further renders the analysis unsound.\n[102] Rovi also argues that the Federal Court made a number of errors in its denial of an injunction. It takes issue with: i) the adoption, for the first time in Canadian jurisprudence, of the U.S. approach to the grant of a permanent injunction set out in eBay; ii) the statement of principle that injunctions should not be available to patentees who choose to practice their inventions in Canada through licensees; iii) the use of a misapplied U.S. theory of patent holdup as a justification to deny the injunction; iv) the refusal to grant the injunction because of \u201cthe imminent expiry of the 585 Patent\u201d to spare Bell and Telus the cost of compliance; and v) the concern that an injunction would reward \u201cRovi\u2019s delay through overcompensation\u201d: see Rovi\u2019s memorandum of fact and law (public version) at para.108.\n[103] Like in the companion appeal in Videotron, Rovi is correct in many of these assertions. The companion appeal contains a full discussion of the principles applicable to remedies for patent infringement, and specifically the award of an accounting of profits, at paragraphs 92-114. These principles are equally applicable here.\n[104] With these principles in mind, I turn next to assess the various arguments advanced by Rovi on this appeal. I will consider the various errors that the Federal Court is alleged to have made in its treatment of the request for an accounting of profits first and then move on to the various errors alleged in the Federal Court\u2019s injunction analysis.\n[105] I agree with Rovi, at paragraph 103 of their Memorandum, that the Federal Court erred in describing the goal of an accounting of profits as \u201ccompensatory\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 582. The reasons in Videotron set out why this is not the case at paragraphs 97 and 98.\n[106] Turning next to the factors considered for an accounting of profits, Rovi argues that the Federal Court erred in its analysis of the factors relating to complexity, the respondents\u2019 conduct, Rovi\u2019s conduct, and Rovi\u2019s delay. Starting with complexity, Rovi argues that the Federal Court erred in law by introducing the reliability of the result of an accounting as a new factor for entitlement. Rovi alleges that the Federal Court placed the bar too high by holding that the Court \u201cmust be satisfied that every step in the analysis is possible, realistic and will produce a reliable result\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 599.\n[107] I disagree. While complexity is not a factor that, alone, can justify denying an accounting, Justice de Montigny, then writing for the Federal Court, confirmed that \u201can accounting of profits may be inappropriate where the accounting exercise would be complex and contentious, and where a reference on profits would result in a lengthy and complicated procedure and related disputes which would complicate and further delay a final resolution of the matter\u201d: Philip Morris Products S.A. v. Marlboro Canada Ltd., 2015 FC 364, [2015] F.C.J. No. 1564 at paras. 25-26, aff\u2019d 2016 FCA 55, 264 A.C.W.S. (3d) 186 at paras. 12-14, citing Laboratoires Servier, Adir, Oril Industries, Servier Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2008 FC 825, 67 C.P.R. (4th) 241 at paras. 507-508, aff\u2019d 2009 FCA 222, 75 C.P.R. (4th) 443, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 33357 (25 March 2010); Eurocopter at paras. 409-416.\n[108] In this case, contrary to what Rovi says, the Federal Court found that isolating the impact of the allegedly infringing features \u201cwould prove extremely challenging\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 598. The Federal Court found that \u201cthere [was] a real risk that the analysis could ultimately be based on flawed assumptions about customer or market behaviour, non-infringing alternatives or competitors, or based on non-transparent analytical decisions in market modeling\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 599. The decision also highlights that Rovi\u2019s expert \u201cconceded that if there were problems with any of the steps in the analysis the result would be unreliable\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 599.\n[109] These findings were open to the Federal Court in light of the nature of the calculations put forward by Rovi\u2019s experts. These were based on a market reconstruction premised on Rovi\u2019s entire patent portfolio, and not just the claims in suit, and included the profits earned by the respondents relating to cable TV content subscriptions as well as its non-TV lines of business, which did not involve similar technologies to those claimed in the Patents. There was ample basis for the Federal Court to have concluded that the methods proposed by Rovi\u2019s experts would not allow the Court to arrive at a reliable and appropriate amount for profits earned by reason of any infringement, had it found the claims valid. Thus, there is no error in the Federal Court\u2019s treatment of this issue.\n[110] Turning to the factor relating to the respondents\u2019 conduct, Rovi implies that the Federal Court was wrong to consider the absence of \u201cwilful infringement\u201d as the test for this factor. In the alternative, Rovi argues that the Federal Court erred in finding that there was no evidence of any wilful infringement that would call for deterrent measures. In its view, the Federal Court overlooked that the respondents continued with their infringement unabated when their license was lost: Federal Court Decision at para. 635.\n[111] This Court has summarized the jurisprudence on this factor as considering \u201cthe defendant\u2019s knowing and intentional infringement\u201d as a factor that may favour granting an accounting of profits: Apotex Inc. v. ADIR, 2020 FCA 60, 172 C.P.R. (4th) 1 at para. 120, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 39172 (24 September 2020), citing Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser, 2004 SCC 34, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 902 at para. 95; Rivett v. Monsanto Canada Inc., 2010 FCA 207, 325 D.L.R. (4th) 107 at para. 32. Given this, it cannot be said that the Federal Court was wrong to consider \u201cwilful infringement\u201d as a factor that might be considered in favouring an accounting of profits.\n[112] Second, there is no palpable and overriding error in the Federal Court\u2019s finding that there was no evidence of any wilful infringement on the part of the respondents in this case. While Rovi argues that the Federal Court overlooked that Bell and Telus continued with their infringement unabated when their license was lost, the Federal Court explicitly considered and rejected this argument. At paragraph 631, the Federal Court found that although Rovi claims that Bell and Telus knew of Rovi\u2019s Patents, \u201cthe [respondents] were only shown exemplary patents picked by Rovi and given a glimpse of Rovi\u2019s patent portfolio\u201d. According to the Federal Court, there was \u201cno evidence the claims asserted in this litigation, let alone the Patents, were the focus of the licensing negotiations\u201d: Federal Court Decision at para. 631.\n[113] On the factor focussed on Rovi\u2019s business practices, Rovi stresses that the choice to license a patent is not a principle on which to deny an accounting. I agree, and as I stated in the companion appeal, the mere fact that a patentee licences or intends to licence the patent should not disentitle the plaintiff to an accounting of profits: see Videotron at paras. 109-110.\n[114] On delay, Rovi takes issue with the Federal Court\u2019s finding that delay in patent prosecution conduct, within statutorily permitted timeframes, is a proper factor for disentitlement to an accounting of profits: Federal Court Decision at para. 613. According to Rovi, the cases cited by the Federal Court \u201caddress delay in instituting or advancing court proceedings (i.e., after patent grant), not a \u201cdelay\u201d in patent prosecution before the rights are acquired\u201d. Rovi also argues that even if a delay in patent prosecution could be considered a factor against granting an accounting of profits, such a determination can only be made with the benefit of evidence of full patent file histories and expert guidance. No such evidence, according to Rovi, was considered by the Federal Court in this case.\n[115] I agree with Rovi that the case law has yet to recognize delay in patent prosecution as a factor that would militate against an accounting of profits. Nevertheless, as I stated in Videotron, I would not completely foreclose the possibility that this sort of delay could be relevant to refusing an accounting of profits. If there were ever a basis to determine that a plaintiff had unclean hands in seeking to extend the prosecution time to allow a defendant to accumulate profits that the plaintiff would then obtain, such conduct could well be sufficiently inequitable to disentitle a plaintiff to an accounting of profits.\n[116] Importantly, however, to come to this conclusion, this Court requires factual and\/or expert evidence to demonstrate whether the length of time taken to obtain the Canadian patent was unduly long or short and evidence from which inferences may be drawn as to the patentee\u2019s intentions in delaying prosecution of its patents. As stated in Videotron, \u201c[w]ithout evidence as to what patent prosecution practice is and means in each country this Court cannot draw meaningful inferences as to delay or wilfulness\u201d: Videotron at para. 125, citing Merck & Co. v. Apotex Inc., 2006 FC 524, [2006] F.C.J. No. 1490 at para. 39, rev\u2019d (on other grounds) 2006 FCA 323, [2006] F.C.J. No. 1490, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 31754 (10 May 2007). Experts could be retained to consider a number of factors to assess the adequacy of the explanation for a delay in prosecution, including the actual duration of the applicant\u2019s delay, how it compares to delays typically seen, and whether the delay was caused by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO). In addition, evidence as to the purpose behind the use of delay tactics would be relevant.\n[117] In the instant case, the Federal Court had no evidence about normal practice and delays typically seen before the Patent Office, nor about Rovi\u2019s motives in prosecuting the Patents the way it did. The Court could not infer merely from the time it took to prosecute the patents that Rovi was engaged in delay tactics. Therefore, it was a reviewable error for the Federal Court to have relied in its remedial analysis on the length of time it took to prosecute the Patents before the Patent Office.\n[118] Beyond these errors, Rovi also argues that the Federal Court erred in its denial of an injunction. Rovi alleges that the Federal Court\u2019s \u201cadoption of the U.S. approach\u201d in this case is a departure from longstanding principles around permanent injunctions in Canada which, it contends, are rarely denied a successful patentee, including those who licence their inventions in Canada.\n[119] I agree with Rovi that permanent injunctions in Canada are rarely denied to a successful patentee if infringement is found. Rarely, however, is the operative word and implies that judges do have the discretion to do so in exceptional circumstances. There are a number of \u201ctraditional concerns of equity\u201d that \u201cimbue many equitable remedies\u201d, including the grant of mandatory injunctions: Jeffrey Berryman, The Law of Equitable Remedies, 3rd ed. (Irwin Law, 2023) at 286 [Berryman]. These concerns of equity translate into discretionary factors that may justify a court in depriving a plaintiff of an injunction, assuming the denial is not arbitrary and is done on a reasoned basis. Such factors include, but are not limited to, 1) delay, 2) unclean hands, 3) hardship, and 4) impossibility of performance: Berryman at 286-291.\n[120] I also agree with Rovi that, prior to this decision, Canadian courts have not endorsed the American approach to permanent injunctions or any related principles derived from the eBay decision. In the U.S., as noted in eBay, to obtain a permanent injunction, a four-factor test requires a plaintiff to demonstrate the following: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardship between plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\n[121] In light of the focus on the irreparable harm in the U.S. context, it is possible that a patentee who is merely seeking licencing revenues would not be considered to suffer irreparable harm without an injunction and could be adequately compensated by damages. Given this, although injunctions are often granted in response to patent infringement, whether a patentee practices the invention may have an important bearing on the analysis in the U.S: see generally Stacy Streur, \u201cThe eBay Effect: Tougher Standards but Courts Return to the Prior Practice of Granting Injunctions for Patent Infringement\u201d (2009) 8(1) Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property 67 for a discussion of how permanent injunctions have evolved since the eBay decision and how U.S. courts have understood irreparable harm in this context.\n[122] However, in Canada, there is no separate requirement for irreparable harm nor an explicit requirement for balancing in the test for a permanent injunction as opposed to an interlocutory one. In Google Inc. v. Equustek Solutions Inc., 2017 SCC 34, [2017] S.C.R. 824, Justices C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe, writing in dissent (on other grounds), stated \u201c[t]o obtain a permanent injunction, a party is required to establish: (1) its legal rights; (2) that damages are an inadequate remedy; and (3) that there is no impediment to the court's discretion to grant an injunction\u201d: at para. 66, citing 1711811 Ontario Ltd. v. Buckley Insurance Brokers Ltd., 2014 ONCA 125, 371 D.L.R. (4th) 643 at paras. 74-80; Ian Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies, 9th ed. (Thomson Reuters, 2014) at 395 and 407-408.\n[123] Aside from these jurisprudential differences, I also note that the focus of the eBay case is not on patent holdup. Although patent holdup was discussed by Justice Kennedy in his concurring opinion, the majority does not reference it at all. Instead, eBay is simply an example where the U.S. Supreme Court denied injunctive relief in a patent case.\n[124] More importantly, even though an injunction is a discretionary remedy, it is generally accepted in this country that an injunction is the principal preventive remedy in patent law. The purpose of an injunction in this context is to prohibit an infringer from infringing the patent for the unexpired portion of the term of the patent: Donald H. MacOdrum, Fox on the Canadian Law of Patents, 5th ed. (Thomson Reuters, 2024, loose-leaf) at \u00a7 14:2; Berryman at 323, citing Roger Hughes & John Woodley, Hughes and Woodley on Patents, 2d ed. (Markham, ON: LexisNexis Butterworths, 2019, loose-leaf) at \u00a7 53; Andrew Shaughnessy & Robert H. Barrigar, Canadian Patent Act Annotated, 2d ed. (Toronto: Thomson Reuters Canada, 2022) at \u00a7 19:151.\n[125] Indeed, in Valence Technology Inc. v. Phostech Lithium Inc., 2011 FC 174, 384 F.T.R. 162, aff\u2019d 2011 FCA 237, 96 C.P.R. (4th) 207, Justice Gauthier found that in upholding the patent, \u201cthe Court should refuse to grant a permanent injunction where there is a finding of infringement, only in very rare circumstances\u201d: at para. 240. This was recently endorsed in three Federal Court decisions: see NCS Multistage Inc. v. Kobold Corporation, 2023 FC 1486, 204 C.P.R. (4th) 1 at para. 1658; Farmobile, LLC v. Farmers Edge Inc., 2022 FC 22, 189 C.P.R. (4th) 281 at para. 86 , aff\u2019d 2022 FCA 116, 2022 A.C.W.S. 2398; Bombardier Recreational Products Inc. v. Arctic Cat, Inc., 2020 FC 946, 178 C.P.R. (4th) 355 at para. 37.\n[126] Thus, absent circumstances that would render injunctive relief inequitable, a plaintiff can generally expect to receive injunctive relief in Canada where a valid patent has not expired and has been infringed. This includes situations where the patent is close to expiry.\n[127] In addition, as with the remedy of an accounting of profits, the fact that a patentee licences its invention does not, in and of itself, disentitle a patentee to injunctive relief for the same reasons noted in Seedlings Life Science Ventures, LLC v. Pfizer Canada ULC, 2021 FCA 154, 339 A.C.W.S. (3d) 69. There Justice Locke wrote as follows at paragraph 79:\nI am particularly concerned about the potential effect of such a broadly defined principle on inventors who recognize that their specialty lies in inventing, and that production and marketing of their inventions are better left to different specialists. Such inventors will seek to license third parties to take their inventions to market as a matter of business efficiency. The broadly defined principle would force such inventors to choose between business efficiency and retaining a potential remedy for infringement of their patent rights. The value of a patent would therefore be reduced for specialist inventors. I see no reason to force such a choice. In my view, business efficiency should be encouraged.\n[128] In my view, the foregoing concerns apply equally to injunctive relief, which accordingly should not be denied merely because a patentee chooses to commercialize its patents by licencing them.\n[129] I also note that the Federal Court\u2019s comment in paragraph 625 of the Decision, to the effect that the respondents were unable to take any action to have the Patents declared invalid when they were pending is somewhat misleading, because it ignores the existence of section 34.1 of the Patent Act, which permits anyone to submit prior art to CIPO to be considered in relation to the patentability of published patent applications.\n[130] As is apparent from the foregoing discussion, I agree with Rovi that the Federal Court erred in many respects in its remedial analysis.\nIV. Proposed Disposition [131] However, these errors regarding remedy do not affect the outcome of this appeal. Because there is no basis to interfere with the Federal Court\u2019s obviousness and anticipation findings, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\n\u201cMary J.L.

In addition to the election of the Chief, the applicants Roberta Francis and Christine Mosquito, and the respondent, Wesley Daniels, were elected councillors of the Nekaneet Government.\n[2] Pursuant to the Nekaneet Constitution and Nekaneet Governance Act, the Nekaneet Appeal Body (Appeal Body or NAB) would normally deal with such an appeal. However, the terms of appointment of all three members of that body had expired. Ms. Buffalocalf insisted that the empty seats be filled \u201cimmediately\u201d. Soon thereafter, Ms. Buffalocalf pursued another avenue. Relying on section 8.07 of the Nekaneet Constitution, on April 26, 2023, she delivered to Councillors Francis and Mosquito a Declaration that had the effect of removing the Nekaneet Government from office and calling a general election (the Declaration). Two days later, the Chief and Council appointed the three members of the Nekaneet Appeal Body, and filed an application for judicial review and a motion for interim relief before the Federal Court.\n[3] The Federal Court (per Grammond J.) granted the interim relief (Nekaneet First Nation v. Louison, 2023 FC 709) and eventually concluded that the Declaration was unreasonable because it misinterpreted the Nekaneet Constitution: Nekaneet First Nation v. Louison, 2023 FC 897. It is of that decision that we are now seized on appeal. In file A-193-23, Ms. Buffalocalf appeals the merits of the Federal Court decision, whereas in file A-276-23, the Nekaneet First Nation and named appellants, as well as Ms. Buffalocalf as cross-appellant, challenge the cost award which was the subject of a separate decision of the Federal Court.\n[4] On the merits, Ms. Buffalocalf raised a number of issues pertaining to the reasonableness review conducted by the application judge, including the interpretation of the Nekaneet Constitution, and especially of the timeframe within which the Nekaneet Appeal Body members must be appointed following the expiration of their predecessors\u2019 term of office. I am of the view, however, that we need not, and cannot, deal with these issues because neither the Federal Court nor this Court have jurisdiction on the substratum of the dispute between the parties.\nI. BACKGROUND FACTS AND DECISION BELOW [5] As previously mentioned, the respondents, Chief Wahobin and Councillors Francis and Mosquito were elected to the Government of Nekaneet First Nation on March 29, 2023. The appellant, Ms. Buffalocalf, was a Councillor between 2017 and 2023, but was defeated in her bid for re-election.\n[6] Pursuant to sections 5.04, 19.01 and 19.10 of the Nekaneet Governance Act, any unsuccessful candidate has the right to appeal the election of a candidate within 30 days of the election, on the basis that such elected candidate did not satisfy the qualifications to be a candidate under this Act. The application must be launched and filed with the Nekaneet Appeal Body, whose composition and powers are governed by section 8 of the Nekaneet Constitution. It is intended at all times to consist of a minimum of three members, with staggered terms. It appears from the record that there was no Appeal Body in place between 2017 and March 3, 2020, when three members were appointed at the same time. The terms of appointment of the three members expired on March 2, 2023.\n[7] Ms. Buffalocalf therefore made inquiries as to whether an Appeal Body was appointed, and if not, demanded that the Chief and Council make appointments by April 21, 2023, failing which she would solicit signatures for a Declaration that would call a new election on June 2, 2023. Because it is crucial for the understanding of this appeal, I reproduce in full section 8.07 of the Nekaneet Constitution upon which Ms. Buffalocalf relies:\n8.07 In the event that the Nekaneet Government should fail to appoint or fill vacancies in the Nekaneet Appeal Body in accordance with this Nekaneet Constitution or the laws of Nekaneet, resulting in there being no Nekaneet Appeal Body, then the Nekaneet Government shall cease to hold office the day and date that a declaration is signed by a minimum of 35% of the eligible voters of Nekaneet stating:\n(a) The Nekaneet Government has violated this Nekaneet Constitution or a law of Nekaneet by causing no members to be appointed to the Nekaneet Appeal Body and the Nekaneet Government is therefore removed from office;\n(b) A General Election is called;\n(c) The date of the General Election, the date of the nomination meeting ad the naming of Chief Electoral Officer and the Deputy Electoral Officer for the General Election;\nIn such event, the then Nekaneet Government shall cease to hold office effective on the date such declaration, or a copy thereof is delivered to the then Chief or to at least two of the then Councillors, and the General Election shall proceed under the charge of the Chief Electoral Officer who shall have the full power to run the General Election and the fees and expenses associated with such General Election shall be a debt due and payable by Nekaneet.\n[8] Since the Government had not made Appeal Body appointments by April 21, 2023, Ms. Buffalocalf collected 148 signatures (about 38% of eligible voters) and delivered the Declaration on April 26, 2023, to Councillors Francis and Mosquito (Chief Wahobin was outside of the country for a Tribal Council meeting). Shortly thereafter, on April 28, 2023, the Chief and Council filled the three vacancies on the Appeal Body and commenced an application for judicial review of the Declaration in the Federal Court.\n[9] The crux of the dispute with respect to the reasonableness of the Declaration is the timeline within which the appointments to the Appeal Board ought to be made. The arguments of the parties to this dispute revolve around the language of the various paragraphs of section 8. Ms. Buffalocalf relies on section 8.1, pursuant to which the Nekaneet Government shall \u201cforthwith\u201d appoint the Nekaneet Appeal Body and fill vacancies \u201cin a timely manner\u201d as they occur. The Chief and Council, on the other hand, are rather of the view that the deadline for filling vacancies does not expire until at least 60 days after the vacancies arose.\n[10] In the Federal Court, Justice Grammond sided with the Chief and Council and concluded that the expressions \u201cforthwith\u201d and \u201ctimely manner\u201d found in section 8.01, when read in context, must be interpreted to mean within 60 days. For that proposition, the application judge relied on sections 8.04 (initial appointments \u201cshall be made no later than sixty (60) days from the date of the Nekaneet 2008 election\u201d) and 8.05 (vacancy resulting from termination, death or resignation of a member \u201cshall be filled by the Government within sixty (60) days of such event\u201d). While acknowledging that these two sections are not applicable to the case at bar, Justice Grammond opined that an interpretation of the phrase \u201ctimely manner\u201d that would lead to different results depending on the type of vacancy would be curious. As he stated, \u201c[m]uch more precise language would be needed to make it reasonable to conclude that \u201ctimely manner\u201d means 60 days with respect to certain vacancies but is left to the appreciation of the authors of a declaration in other cases\u201d (at para. 25 of his reasons). Accordingly, the Federal Court came to the conclusion that the Declaration is invalid as it was unreasonable to ignore the 60-day time limit for making appointments.\n[11] In separate reasons, Justice Grammond awarded costs in the amount of $5,000 to the respondents. In doing so, he dismissed the respondents\u2019 request for elevated costs, as well as both parties\u2019 requests that their costs be paid by the First Nation.\nII. ISSUES [12] As mentioned earlier, Ms. Buffalocalf raised a number of issues with respect to the Federal Court\u2019s decision on the merits. First and foremost, she disagrees with the interpretation given to section 8.01 by the Federal Court. In her view, there are two forms of appointments, with different timelines. Initial appointments in 2008 were to be made within 60 days, whereas subsequent appointments are to be made \u201cforthwith\u201d. Vacancies differ from appointments in that they arise in the middle of a term of appointment, whereas appointments occur at the beginning of a term. Even if the appointment of new members after the expiration of the predecessors\u2019 terms of appointment constitutes the filling of a vacancy for the purposes of s. 8.01, which she denies, the timeline for replacement would be \u201cin a timely manner\u201d, and not \u201cwithin sixty (60) days\u201d, because appointments arising on the expiration of a predecessor\u2019s term do not fall within the ambit of \u201ctermination, death or resignation of a member\u201d, as envisaged in section 8.05. \u201cTermination\u201d as used in that section connotes removal by the Government; besides, the drafters would have added \u201cexpiration of the term of office\u201d to section 8.05 if they wanted the 60-day timeline to apply to that situation, since they were clearly aware of that scenario as shown in section 8.06.\n[13] Ms. Buffalocalf also claims that the application judge erred in applying, in effect, a correctness standard under the guise of a reasonableness review. In the same vein, she argues that Justice Grammond failed to consider principles of deference to indigenous decision-makers, thereby ignoring not only common law principles but also Parliament\u2019s enactment of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act, S.C. 2021, c. 14.\n[14] For the reasons that I will develop below in my analysis, I shall not evaluate these arguments. The only issues that need be addressed are the following:\n1)Does this Court (and the Federal Court) have jurisdiction to review the Declaration and to deal with the application brought by the respondents in file A-193-23?\n2)Was the application for judicial review in file A-193-23 premature?\n3)Did the Federal Court commit any legal or palpable and overriding error in awarding costs?\nIII. ANALYSIS 1) The jurisdiction of the Federal Courts over First Nations disputes and electoral matters [15] As statutory courts established pursuant to section 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (UK), 30 & 31 Vict., c. 3, reprinted in R.S.C. 1985, Appendix II (the Constitution Act), it is well established that the Federal Court and this Court only have the jurisdiction that is conferred upon them by statute; moreover, that statutory jurisdiction must relate to the application of a law of Canada within the meaning of section 101 of the Constitution Act: see, inter alia, ITO Int\u2019l Terminal Operators v. Miida Electronics, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 752; Canada (Attorney General) v. TeleZone Inc., 2010 SCC 62; Windsor (City) v. Canadian Transit Co., 2016 SCC 54 (Windsor). Sections 18 and 28 of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 (the FCA) further impose a statutory limitation on the Federal Courts\u2019 exclusive jurisdiction to hear applications for judicial review: the review being sought must relate to decisions of a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d, as this phrase is defined in subsection 2(1) of the FCA. According to that definition, it means \u201cany body, person or persons having, exercising or purporting to exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of Parliament.\u201d\n[16] In their initial submissions before this Court, both parties seem to take for granted that the Federal Court and this Court have the jurisdiction to deal with the application for judicial review brought by the respondents. The appellant, in particular, argues that the signatories of the Declaration were empowered to make the collective decision to sign and deliver the Declaration per section 8.07 of the Nekaneet Constitution, and are therefore a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d in the exercise of this authority. As for the respondents, they appear to be of the same view. While they do not squarely address the jurisdictional issue in their initial memorandum, they emphasized at paragraph 31 of their Notice of Application that a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d includes any body or persons \u201cpurporting\u201d to exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of Parliament, and as such, that the Declaration was made by such a body of persons. They also relied on the fact that the Chief Electoral Officer that the Declaration purports to appoint for the purpose of a general election is a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d in her own right.\n[17] Since neither party (nor the Federal Court, for that matter) satisfactorily addressed the jurisdictional issue, this Court issued a direction on May 9, 2024, requesting supplemental submissions on two points: (1) whether the factual scenario underlying this judicial review comes within federal jurisdiction, insofar as it involves an exercise of power by a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d; and (2) whether this case involves a \u201cdecision\u201d or \u201cmatter\u201d that can form the basis of a judicial review application for the purpose of subsections 18.1(1) and (3) of the FCA. The parties duly obliged and filed written submissions on these two issues, which I will now address.\n[18] There are three main routes to ground the Federal Courts\u2019 jurisdiction over First Nations electoral matters: (a) the Band Council acting as a federal body; (b) the supervisory jurisdiction over First Nation\u2019s elections; and (c) the writ of quo warranto.\n[19] Band Councils established under the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5, are a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d whose decisions are subject to judicial review when they exercise their powers over band members under a federal statute: Sebastian v. Saugeen First Nation No. 29 (Council of), 2003 FCA 28 at para. 51; Sioui v. Huron-Wendat Nation Council, 2023 FC 1731 at para. 30. Pursuant to the definition of \u201ccouncil of the band\u201d found in subsection 2(1) of the Indian Act, a band council is not necessarily selected as a result of an election under the specific procedure set out in an Act of Parliament such as subsection 74(1) of the Indian Act or in the First Nations Elections Act, S.C. 2014, c. 5. It can also be chosen according to the unwritten custom of the Band or by their own Election Codes, as is the case here: Ratt v. Matchewan, 2010 FC 160 at paras. 104-106 (Ratt).\n[20] When selected through custom, the powers exercised by First Nations in relation to the selection of their leaders are incorporated by reference in the Indian Act; as such, they are conferred by an Act of Parliament, and fall within the ambit of \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d: Canatonquin v. Gabriel, [1980] 2 F.C. 729 (FCA), 1980 CanLII 4125; Ermineskin First Nation v. Minde, 2008 FCA 52 at para. 33 (Minde); Bellegarde v. Carry the Kettle First Nation, 2024 FC 699 at paras. 50-52 (Bellegarde).\n[21] Where the powers exercised by Band Councils are delegated to other decision-making bodies, agents or persons, they will still come within the purview of section 18.1 of the FCA. For instance, a Housing Authority acting as an agent of the First Nation to evict someone is reviewable under section 18.1. An Elections Board reviewing election appeals and complaints is also considered a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d, provided its powers derive from legislation effected under the Indian Act. Similarly, an Elders Council\u2019s decision to determine an elected official\u2019s office \u201cvacated\u201d comes within section 18 of the FCA because it was statutorily empowered under a Band Constitution: see Cyr v. Batchewana First Nation of Ojibways, 2022 FCA 90 at para. 44; Opaskwayak Cree Nation v. Cook, 2023 FC 505 at para. 30; Minde at para. 33; Bellegarde at para. 29 and case law herein cited.\n[22] There is also a second line of jurisprudence to the effect that Federal Courts have supervisory jurisdiction over Band elections when executed according to Band customs. This extends to decisions made by election appeal bodies: see Minde; Francis v. Mohawk Council of Kanasetake, [2003] 4 F.C. 1133 at paras. 11-18; Ballantyne v. Nasikapow, (2001) 197 F.T.R. 184 at paras. 5-6; Ratt at paras. 96-100. This type of jurisdiction has even been extended to decisions that are \u201cintimately related to the electoral process\u201d, including an Election Officer removing a candidate from the ballot, a Council\u2019s failure to take further steps after the body designated to resolve the dispute declined to act, and the disputed officeholder refusing to resign: see Thomas v. One Arrow First Nation, 2019 FC 1663 at paras. 13-14.\n[23] Also connected to the Courts\u2019 supervisory jurisdiction over Band elections is the power to review disputes when there is no decision from a \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d, but where the prerogative writ of quo warranto is sought. This is the third ground of federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction over First Nations electoral matters. Quo warranto is a challenge to the right of a public office holder to hold office, and can include challenging the authority that one claims to act with: see Ojibway Nation of Saugeen v. Derose, 2022 FC 531 at para. 26; Marie v. Wanderingspirit, 2003 FCA 385 at para. 20 (Wanderingspirit); Key First Nation v. Lavallee, 2021 FCA 123 at para. 59; Lake Babine Indian Band et al. v. Williams et al., (1996) 194 N.R. 44 (F.C.A.) at paras. 3-4; Standingready v. Ocean Man First Nation, 2021 FC 434 at para. 13. The alleged illegality must pertain to the person\u2019s eligibility to hold office, or to the electoral process itself. It is unavailable for alleged illegalities that are unrelated to a person\u2019s eligibility, and is not a tool to express political grievances. It cannot be used to assert that office holders have made unwise decisions or misused powers entrusted to them.\n[24] This case does not sit comfortably within any of the three routes whereby the Federal Courts can claim jurisdiction.\n[25] In their supplemental submissions filed in response to the direction of this Court dated May 9, 2024, both the appellant and the respondents rely heavily on Justice Grammond\u2019s reasoning in his order granting interim relief. Interestingly, the appellant had argued before the Federal Court that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the respondent\u2019s application for judicial review and could not, as a result, grant interim relief in the form of an emergency injunction. Justice Grammond dismissed that argument in his order granting interim relief:\n[15] Ms. Buffalocalf raises an objection to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction. She says that contrary to what took place in Bellegarde, the applicants are not challenging a decision made by a federal board, commission or other tribunal,\u201d, but rather a decision made by the Nekaneet voters, In my view, this does not make any difference, There is no doubt that this Court may review decisions made by a First Nation\u2019s voters, where they purport to exercise a power granted by the First Nation\u2019s election laws: see, for example, Marie v Wanderingspirit, 2003 FCA 385; Oakes v Pahtayken, 2010 FCA 169; Narte v Gladstone, 2021 FC 433.\n[26] In my view, the above-quoted paragraph and the arguments submitted by the parties before us conflate the various jurisdictions of the Federal Courts with respect to Band elections, and also blurs the line between what is properly an electoral matter and an issue of governance. Indeed, one should keep in mind that section 8 of the Nekaneet Constitution cannot be characterized as an election law, but a provision establishing the Nekaneet Appeal Body and the rules for the appointment of its members, and setting out its jurisdiction. In the event that the NAB is not properly constituted, section 8.07 creates an automatic, democratic mechanism whereby this violation of the Nekaneet Constitution can be remedied. Of course, the process put in place involves a vote, the removal of the Nekaneet Government and the election of a new government, but section 8.07 cannot be assimilated to an election law in the same way as the cases cited by Justice Grammond in the above-quoted paragraph. A short analysis of these cases will demonstrate that point.\n[27] Wanderingspirit concerned a Band meeting held to vote-out certain elected councillors, and simultaneously vote-in new councillors to replace them. There was no notice to the Band members before the meeting that this election would take place. The voted-out group sought judicial review of the vote to remove them, and the election of new councillors. The trial division granted the application and found both votes were of no effect.\n[28] On appeal, the appellants argued that the \u201cwill of the people\u201d must be respected to choose elected representatives. This Court agreed with this proposition, but with the caveat that the \u201cwill of the people\u201d must respect the Band\u2019s election custom and due process. The meeting vote was not in accordance with the First Nation\u2019s election customs, nor did it respect the principles of natural justice because no notice was provided.\n[29] It is interesting to note that this Court accepted that there was no \u201cdecision\u201d. However, such a decision was not necessary in the circumstances, because what was challenged was the authority of the voted-in councillors to exercise authority in place of the voted-out group. The Court therefore relied on its quo warranto jurisdiction: \u201c[a]lthough their application was for a declaration and not expressly for a writ of quo warranto, the substance of what they were seeking was a declaration equivalent to the prerogative writ of quo warranto\u201d (at para. 17). As such, the Court had jurisdiction per paragraph 18(1)(a) of the FCA. As outlined above, this Court stressed that quo warranto is an exception to the normal rule that judicial review must be conducted on a decision of a federal board, commission or other tribunal (at para. 20).\n[30] On the basis of this short summary, it is easy to understand the important distinctions between the case at bar and Wanderingspirit. The application for judicial review of the Declaration made by the newly-elected Council and Chief is not a challenge to the right of a public office holder to hold office, and therefore cannot be assimilated to a quo warranto. It is true that the person named as Chief Electoral Officer is mentioned in the Notice of Application, but nothing turned on that nomination and neither the appellant nor the respondents make much of that nomination or genuinely analyze her position.\n[31] The appellant\u2019s own conduct bears out this interpretation of the application for judicial review that was before the Federal Court. On April 17, 2023, she brought an application before the NAB for various reliefs, including a declaration that the respondent Carolyn Wahobin be disqualified from being a candidate for the office of Chief, thereby challenging her election. She seemed to understand that the only route to challenge the Chief\u2019s election was through an application before the NAB. Because there was no properly constituted NAB within the 30-day period to challenge the election, Ms. Buffalocalf resorted to the constitutional mechanism of a Declaration. What is worth stressing, however, is that a declaration operates automatically once it is signed by a minimum of 35% of the eligible voters. It is not based on a challenge to the right of a public officer to hold office. Rather, it is premised on the notion that the members of the Nekaneet Government were eligible to hold office, but violated the Nekaneet Constitution by not appointing or filling the vacancies in the NAB. Challenging a declaration, therefore, cannot properly be equated with a quo warranto.\n[32] Some of the submissions made by the Chief and Council as appellants in the costs appeal also reinforce my analysis on the merits. They acknowledge that the purpose of a section 8.07 Declaration is to function in the unique event where there is no Nekaneet Appeal Body. Contrary to their submissions on the merits appeal, they also assert that there is only one decision on appeal, that being the Declaration. Finally, and importantly for the question of jurisdiction, they submit that the election appeal and the Declaration were independent of each other.\n[33] Regrettably, the application judge glossed over that fundamental difference between what has come to pass in this case and the essential characteristics of the writ of quo warranto. It is no doubt true that the Declaration was set in motion shortly after an election was held, and had the effect in practice of overturning the results of that election. The fact remains, however, that the Declaration was not a direct challenge to the election and was one-step removed from it. As much as one may wish to read an application for its underlying substance, the Federal Courts should be careful not to overstep their jurisdiction.\n[34] This conceptual confusion is further illustrated by Pahtayken v. Oakes, 2009 FC 134 (Pahtayken] and Narte v. Gladstone, 2021 FC 433 (Narte). The first of these two cases involved Nekaneet First Nation\u2019s adoption of two different slates of Chiefs and Councillors. A determination of who was legally in charge was therefore required. The applicants had led a referendum to pass both the Nekaneet Constitution and the Nekaneet Governance Act, and were then elected pursuant to the election procedures set out in these two governing documents. The respondents, however, boycotted the referendum and were elected pursuant to the pre-existing Band custom. The Federal Court ruled that the applicants were legally elected, as the referendum to adopt the governing documents represented a \u201csufficient\u201d consensus: Pahtayken at para. 66. Our Court confirmed that decision of the Federal Court: Oakes v. Pahtayken, 2010 FCA 169. While this Court did not touch on jurisdiction, it is interesting to note that the applicants had sought a writ of quo warranto pursuant to subsection 18(1) of the FCA at the trial level. Again, this is not the situation we are dealing with.\n[35] Finally, in Narte, the applicants sought to remove council members from a First Nation\u2019s Council because they failed to disclose financial information and provide drug-testing results. They applied to the Court for an order to remove the councillors and call a new election. Once again, as noted by Justice Grammond in that case, the applicants were seeking a declaration and a writ of quo warranto \u201ceffectively removing\u201d the councillors from the Band council. This is not the remedy that was sought by the respondents in our case before the Federal Court.\n[36] In summary, I am of the view that neither this Court nor the Federal Court can claim jurisdiction over this case pursuant to subsection 18(1) of the FCA on the basis of it being an application for quo warranto. Perhaps at the invitation of the respondents (then applicants), who clearly sought to ground their application in the quo warranto jurisdiction of the Court, Justice Grammond took for granted that this is a case concerning the validity of an election. While he was no doubt entitled to read the material before him for its true substance, he nevertheless stated that the only decision on review was the Declaration. As mentioned earlier, that Declaration is a constitutional mechanism to remedy a constitutional violation. That constitutional violation \u2013 not appointing NAB members \u2013 is not directly tied to the validity of an election, even if it occurred in an election context. Indeed, the respondents explicitly acknowledge that the purpose of section 8.07 is \u201cnot to recall, remove, or reverse the result of an election\u201d (at para. 74 of their factum).\n[37] In light of the foregoing, I fail to see how this Court (and the Federal Court) can have jurisdiction over the application brought forward by the respondents. In the exercise of their supervisory jurisdiction pursuant to section 18.1 of the FCA, the Federal Courts\u2019 jurisdiction only encompasses decisions or actions of federal boards, commissions or other tribunals. In a similar context, this Court endorsed the Federal Court\u2019s ruling that a Band council vote did not qualify as a \u201cdecision\u201d for the purposes of section 18.1 of the FCA: Wanderingspirit at para. 17. If this is true of a vote taken at a Band Council meeting (although irregularly held), it must equally be true for a petition signed by a minimum of 35% of the eligible voters.\n[38] Even if the Declaration could arguably be considered as a \u201cdecision\u201d in the sense that it affects legal rights and causes prejudicial effects, assimilating a grass-roots petition to dissolve the Government for non-election reasons to a federal body would be an impermissible stretch. Indeed, neither Justice Grammond nor the parties substantiated this claim with any precedent. While the case law has extended the notion of \u201cfederal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d to all sorts of decision-making bodies exercising delegated authority from Band Councils, I am unaware of any decision where a specified threshold of the eligible electors (let alone petitioners) have been granted that status. The fact that the Declaration (and the anticipated new election) flows from custom law incorporated into federal statute law is not sufficient. To be subject to judicial review before the Federal Court or the Federal Court of Appeal, there must still be a \u201cdecision\u201d made by a \u201cfederal board, commission or tribunal.\u201d\n[39] For all of the foregoing reasons, I am therefore of the view that the Federal Court erred in concluding that it had jurisdiction to judicially review the Declaration dissolving the Nekaneet Government.\n2) The administrative process has not been exhausted [40] Even if, for the sake of the argument, I was prepared to accept that the Federal Court did have jurisdiction to entertain the application, there is another compelling reason why it should have declined to do so. It is well established that judicial review is a discretionary remedy. When the administrative process has put in place remedial recourses, these should normally be exhausted before courts can step in. This is a cardinal rule of Canadian administrative law, and nowhere has it been more eloquently spelled out than in Canada (Border Services Agency) v. C.B. Powell Limited, 2010 FCA 61 (C.B. Powell), where this Court stated (at para. 31):\nAdministrative law judgments and textbooks describe this rule in many ways: the doctrine of exhaustion, the doctrine of adequate alternative remedies, the doctrine against fragmentation or bifurcation of administrative proceedings, the rule against interlocutory judicial reviews and the objection against premature judicial reviews. All of these express the same concept: absent exceptional circumstances, parties cannot proceed to the court system until the administrative process has run its course. This means that, absent exceptional circumstances, those who are dissatisfied with some matter arising in the ongoing administrative process must pursue all effective remedies that are available within that process; only when the administrative process has finished or when the administrative process affords no effective remedy can they proceed to court. Put another way, absent exceptional circumstances, courts should not interfere with ongoing administrative processes until after they are completed, or until the available, effective remedies are exhausted.\n[41] See also the cases cited at paragraph 30 of C.B. Powell, as well as: Strickland v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 37 at paras. 40, 42; Halifax (Regional Municipality) v. Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission), 2012 SCC 10 at paras. 35-37 (Halifax); Dugr\u00e9 v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 8 at para. 37; Viaguard Accu-Metrics Laboratory v. Standards Council of Canada, 2023 FCA 63 at paras. 4-5.\n[42] As noted in the case law, there are practical and theoretical reasons for judicial restraint. One of the rationales for this rule is that a premature intervention by a reviewing court could deprive it of a full record, and of an administrative decision-maker\u2019s factual and evidentiary findings. Such findings are often suffused with expertise, policy judgments and regulatory experience: C.B. Powell, at para. 32. Indeed, early judicial intervention may lead to the imposition by a court of what amounts to the \u201ccorrect\u201d interpretation of a legal question that an administrative tribunal could have reasonably interpreted differently: Halifax, at para. 36. Such caution is all the more critical in an aboriginal context, and especially when dealing with governance and electoral disputes, where courts are at a disadvantage compared to decision-makers steeped in or familiar with the culture and traditions of the Band within which a dispute arose.\n[43] In the case at bar, section 8.08 of the Nekaneet Constitution makes it very clear that the NAB was to have exclusive jurisdiction over all matters governed by a law adopted by the Nekaneet. That section reads as follows:\n8.08 The Nekaneet Appeal Body has the jurisdiction to hear and resolve any conflict or dispute relating to an issue governed by a law of Nekaneet or address violations of a law of Nekaneet based on remedies and processes that are fair, just and equitable and in accordance with the laws of Nekaneet.\n[44] The appellant contends that there was no alternative administrative remedy and that the NAB cannot have authority to review a Declaration, since the very raison d\u2019\u00eatre of such Declaration is to dissolve Government where there is no NAB in place. This is precisely what happened here.\n[45] With all due respect, this argument does not hold water. First of all, and parenthetically, I note that the appellant is not seeking before this Court an order confirming that the current Chief and Council is dissolved as of the date of the Declaration, but only as of the date of the judgment in this appeal. She accepts that the validity of the Declaration was suspended pending the determination of the merits as a result of the injunctions issued by the Federal Court, which were not appealed. This is made even clearer by counsel for the appellant, who stated in an email to NAB members on August 9, 2023, that his client is not challenging the validity of their appointments before this Court.\n[46] Even if one were to accept that the appointment of NAB members by the Chief and Council on April 28, 2023, was arguably controversial, the proper venue to challenge the legality of those appointments was before the NAB itself. This is indeed precisely what Ms. Buffalocalf did. She brought an application to the NAB pursuant to the Nekaneet Constitution and the Nekaneet Governance Act for various forms of relief, including a declaration that the respondent Carolyn Wahobin is disqualified from being a candidate for office of Chief and declaring Alvin Francis is the elected Chief.\n[47] The NAB released a preliminary decision dealing with some jurisdictional issues on July 25, 2023, and a decision to hold the application in abeyance on August 8, 2023. Although that decision is not part of the record, we were told at the hearing that the NAB had to deal with the legality of their own appointment before addressing the substance of the application. This is exactly as it should be. If the appellant did not agree with that decision, she could have made an application for judicial review before the Federal Court. This would have been the proper procedure to follow, respectful of the administrative process established in the Nekaneet Constitution. For the respondents to short-circuit that process by bringing an application for judicial review of the Declaration before the Federal Court was no substitute for the NAB\u2019s exclusive authority to determine constitutional violations and assess the eligibility of the newly elected Chief.\n3) The costs appeal and cross-appeal [48] In file number A-276-23, both parties appeal the cost order of $5,000 against Ms. Buffalocalf. The Nekaneet First Nation, Chief Carolyn Wahobin, and Councillors Roberta Francis and Christine Mosquito argue in their appeal that the Federal Court made reviewable legal errors, first in deciding that Rule 420 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR 98-106, does not apply to offers to settle that include a costs-only compromise, and second in interpreting section 16.04 of the Nekaneet Governance Act which prohibits a Chief or Councillor to use Nekaneet funds to pay for legal fees related to an election challenge. In her cross-appeal, Ms. Shauna Buffalocalf requests that the Order of the Federal Court be set aside, and contends in particular that it was an error to find that she was not acting in the public interest and therefore that she should be allowed to collect her fees from the First Nations regardless of the outcome.\n[49] In light of my conclusion on the merits in file A-193-23, there should be no order with respect to costs. This case is somewhat unusual since both parties argued that the Federal Court had jurisdiction to deal with the application brought by the respondents in that file. Having found that such was not the case and that the Federal Court erred in accepting the parties\u2019 submissions in this respect, none of the parties have succeeded in this Court. For that reason, each party should bear its own costs.\n[50] As for the costs order in the Federal Court, it should be reversed because the case should never have proceeded in the first place. It is true that on appeal, this Court usually refrains from interfering with costs awards in the Federal Court because of their inherent discretionary nature. In the absence of an error in principle, or short of an award that is plainly wrong, appellate courts will not interfere with cost orders: see, for example, Indalex Finance, LLC v. United Steelworkers, 2013 SCC 6 at para. 247; Tazehkand v. Bank of Canada, 2023 FCA 208 at para. 92.\n[51] The situation is different here, however, because the case should never have proceeded in the Federal Court. In such a case, it may be fitting to reverse a trial court\u2019s order when it mistakenly assumes or declines jurisdiction: Windsor at para. 72; Canada (Governor General in Council) v. Mikisew Cree First Nation, 2016 FCA 311 at para. 64 (aff\u2019d at 2018 SCC 40).\n[52] I am, furthermore, comforted, in my opinion, that no cost award should be made in light of the fact that both parties allege financial difficulties. While this factor should obviously not, in and of itself, be determinative, it can be taken into account in a case like this one, where there is no clear winner and where there is no allegation of bad faith.\n[53] For all of the foregoing reasons, I would set aside both the judgment of the Federal Court in file A-193-23 and the Order of the Federal Court in file A-276-23, without costs. Both parties should therefore bear their own costs, both in this Court and in the Federal Court.\n\u201cYves de Montigny\u201d\nChief Justice\n\u201cI agree.\nRen\u00e9 LeBlanc J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nElizabeth Walker J.A.\u201d\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-193-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nSHAUNA BUFFALOCALF v.

Overview\n[1] Air Passenger Rights (APR) seeks judicial review of a Statement on Vouchers published by the intervener, Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA), on or about March 25, 2020, and a CTA webpage titled \u201cImportant Information for Travellers During COVID-19\u201d that referred to the Statement. The Statement was issued in response to the mass cancellation of domestic and international flights that occurred during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada in March 2020. This was a period of air travel chaos and uncertainty for travellers and airlines alike. APR asserts that the Statement and webpage violated the CTA\u2019s Code of Conduct and gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the CTA as a whole and on the part of CTA members who endorsed the Statement. APR alleges that the CTA published the Statement for the improper purpose of assisting airlines by stifling the surge in credit card chargebacks they were then facing. APR also asserts that the Statement misled air passengers regarding their refund rights in the event of flight cancellations.\n[2] APR is a Canadian non-profit entity established to continue the work of Dr. G\u00e1bor Luk\u00e1cs, a long-standing advocate for the rights of air passengers. Its mandate includes education for air passengers and the public of their rights in relation to air travel, enforcement of those rights, appearances before Parliamentary committees regarding air passenger protection, and participation in the CTA consultation processes that resulted in the Air Passenger Protection Regulations, S.O.R.\/2019-150 (the Regulations).\n[3] APR has assumed responsibility for the extensive litigation undertaken by Dr. Luk\u00e1cs in furtherance of his work regarding the interests of air travellers and seeks public interest standing to bring this application.\n[4] The CTA was established under the Canada Transportation Act, S.C. 1996, c. 10 (the Transportation Act), as a quasi-judicial tribunal and regulator with a broad mandate in respect of transportation matters within the legislative authority of Parliament. Its mandate includes air transportation and airlines\u2019 obligations to passengers. The CTA has significant expertise in the transportation sector (see, e.g., Council of Canadians with Disabilities v. VIA Rail Canada Inc., 2007 SCC 15, [2007] S.C.R. 650 at para. 98; Canadian National Railway Company v. Emerson Milling Inc., 2017 FCA 79 at paras. 72-73) and regularly publishes guidance on matters that fall within its regulatory and decision-making roles.\n[5] The CTA sought and was granted intervener status in this proceeding for the purpose of providing written and oral submissions explaining its jurisdiction and practice of publishing guidance materials on the CTA website.\n[6] For the reasons that follow, I find that the Statement is not amenable to judicial review because it does not affect legal rights, impose legal obligations or cause prejudicial effects. The Statement contains non-binding guidance only and expressly reserves the rights of air travel passengers to submit claims to the CTA, each of which will be examined on its merits. I would therefore dismiss this application.\nII. Statement on Vouchers and CTA information webpage\n[7] The Statement opens by referring to the COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread disruption of domestic and international air travel that began in Canada in March 2020. The Statement next refers to the combined effect of the Transportation Act, Regulations and airline tariffs that establish the obligations of airlines in the event of flight disruptions outside of their control. The CTA notes that those legislative provisions and tariffs were developed to address localized and short-term flight disruptions; they did not contemplate the spectre of worldwide flight cancellations caused by the pandemic.\n[8] The Statement attempts to balance the interests of passengers and airlines, stating that passengers who had no prospect of completing their planned itineraries should not be out of pocket for the cost of cancelled flights, but that airlines were facing huge drops in passenger volumes and revenues and \u201cshould not be expected to take steps that could threaten their economic viability\u201d. The Statement continues:\nWhile any specific situation brought before the CTA will be examined on its merits, the CTA believes that, generally speaking, an appropriate approach in the current context could be for airlines to provide affected passengers with vouchers or credits for future travel, as long as these vouchers or credits do not expire in an unreasonably short period of time (24 months would be considered reasonable in most cases).\n[9] The CTA information webpage included in APR\u2019s request for judicial review referred readers to the Statement.\n[10] The CTA informs the Court that the Statement remained on its website for approximately 18 months. It has been removed from the website but remains publicly available as an archived document.\nIII. Preliminary Questions\n[11] There are two preliminary questions that must be answered before the Court can consider the merits of this application:\nIs the Statement subject to judicial review?\nIf so, should the Court grant APR public interest standing?\n[12] The respondent argues that APR\u2019s application for judicial review of the Statement is intrinsically flawed because it is not a matter, decision or order that falls within subsection 18.1(1) of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 (the FC Act). APR disagrees with the respondent and requests public interest standing to bring the application, arguing that it meets each of the factors set forth in Canada (Attorney General) v. Downtown Eastside Sex Workers United Against Violence Society, 2012 SCC 45, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 524 at paragraph 37.\n1. Availability of judicial review\n[13] The respondent submits that the Statement is not amenable to judicial review; in other words, that it is not justiciable. The respondent relies on this Court\u2019s decision in Democracy Watch v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 133 (Democracy Watch 2021), to argue that, for a matter to be subject to judicial review under the FC Act, it must \u201caffect legal rights, impose legal obligations, or cause prejudicial effects\u201d (at para. 29). In the respondent\u2019s view, the Statement does not do so and is no more than non-binding guidance that had no legal effect or prejudicial consequence, and imposed no legal obligation.\n[14] APR acknowledges that the Statement is not a decision but submits that the Court must nonetheless review the Statement and rebuke the conduct of the CTA and its members on the basis that: (a) the Statement is a pre-judgment by the CTA of air passengers\u2019 rights to refunds for cancelled flights, and (b) the CTA acted in response to improper third-party influence in formulating and posting the Statement contrary to its Code of Conduct, giving rise to reasonable apprehension of bias.\n[15] Subsequent to the hearing of this matter, APR requested the opportunity to file supplemental submissions regarding the Court\u2019s recent decision in Sierra Club Canada Foundation v. Canada (Environment and Climate Change), 2024 FCA 86 (Sierra Club). The Court agreed and directed APR and the respondent to each provide submissions, and, for APR, brief reply submissions. The two parties did so and I address their submissions on the Sierra Club decision following my analysis of the parties\u2019 initial written and oral submissions.\n[16] An application for judicial review may be brought by the Attorney General of Canada or by anyone directly affected by a \u201cmatter in respect of which relief is sought\u201d (ss. 18.1(1) of the FC Act). A \u201cmatter\u201d is not restricted to a decision or order. It extends to \u201cany matter in respect of which a remedy may be available\u201d under section 18 of the FC Act (Air Canada v. Toronto Port Authority Et Al, 2011 FCA 347 at para. 24 (Toronto Port Authority), citing Krause v. Canada, [1999] 2 F.C. 476 (C.A.)). Further, subsection 18.1(3) of the FC Act provides that the Federal Courts may on judicial review grant relief relating to the failure, refusal or unreasonable delay to do any \u201cact or thing\u201d and to a \u201cdecision, order, act or proceeding of a federal board, commission or other tribunal\u201d. In Democracy Watch 2021 (at para. 29), the Court confirmed that a reviewable matter is broader than a decision but cautioned that the matter must include something in respect of which a remedy may be available under subsection 18.1(3).\n[17] APR submits that the Statement is justiciable because it is a matter for which remedies are available pursuant to subsections 18.1(1) and 18.1(3) of the FC Act. APR urges the Court to consider the Statement not from a legal perspective but from the perspective of the consumer. APR argues that the Statement gave legitimacy to the airlines\u2019 swift decision to issue vouchers for cancelled flights once the scale of the COVID-19 disruptions became clear. In its opinion, the public would view the Statement as binding, leaving them no choice but to accept their airline\u2019s voucher for future travel and forego any right to a refund.\n[18] I agree that the Court may review the conduct of an administrative body in issuing statements, guidance, bulletins or other matters that fall \u201cshort of formal decisions or orders\u201d (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Canadian Council for Refugees, 2021 FCA 72 at para. 94 (Canadian Council for Refugees)). The fact that the Statement does not take the form of a formal decision or order is not determinative of its justiciability. However, not all administrative conduct is subject to judicial review: \u201cOne such situation is where the conduct attacked in an application for judicial review fails to affect legal rights, impose legal obligations, or cause prejudicial effects\u201d (Toronto Port Authority at para. 29, citing Irving Shipbuilding Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2009 FCA 116, and Democracy Watch v. Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, 2009 FCA 15; see also Sganos v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 84 at para. 6 (Sganos)).\n[19] The Court confirmed the parameters within which matters involving administrative actions are reviewable in paragraph 94 of Canadian Council for Refugees:\n[94] Applications for judicial review are possible where a matter\u2014usually administrative conduct or inaction\u2014affects legal rights, imposes legal obligations or causes real prejudicial effects: Irving Shipbuilding Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2009 FCA 116, [2010] 2 F.C.R. 488 at paras 21-25; Democracy Watch v. Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commission, 2009 FCA 15, 387 N.R. 365. As a result, there are examples of judicial reviews for administrative conduct or inaction falling short of formal decisions or orders [\u2026]. (My emphasis.)\n[20] APR refers to a number of cases in support of its argument that the Statement is justiciable as a manifestation of the CTA\u2019s improper conduct and\/or reasonably indicative of bias. In my view, the decisions in Apotex Inc. v. Canada (Health), 2015 FC 1161 (Apotex), CNG Transmission Corp. v. Canada (National Energy Board) (T.D.), [1992] 1 FC 346, 48 F.T.R. 20 (CNG) and C.D. Lee Trucking Ltd. v. Industrial Wood and Allied Workers of Canada, 1998 CanLII 6678 (BCSC) (C.D. Lee)), are of limited utility to APR\u2019s justiciability arguments. The conduct attacked in each of the three applications resulted in binding decision(s) that clearly affected the legal rights of and had prejudicial effects on the affected applicant.\n[21] APR also argues that the circumstances of the present case are indistinguishable from those before the Ontario Courts in E.A. Manning Ltd. v. Ontario Securities Commission, 18 O.R. (3d) 97, [1994] O.J. No. 1026 (QL) (Div. Ct.) (E.A. Manning Div. Ct.) and E.A. Manning Ltd. v. Ontario Securities Commission, 23 O.R. (3d) 257), [1995] O.J. No. 1305 (QL) (C.A.) (E.A. Manning CA). At issue in the E.A. Manning cases was an application for an order of prohibition to prevent the Ontario Securities Commission (the Commission) from proceeding with two hearings relating to alleged improper sales practices. The appellant companies raised issues of bias and reasonable apprehension of bias arising principally from the adoption by the Commission of Policy Statement 1.10. Previously, the Ontario Court of Appeal had concluded that the Commission acted outside of its statutory mandate in adopting Policy 1.10 by seeking to impose a \u201cde facto legislative regime complete with detailed substantive requirements\u201d: Ainsley Financial Corp. v. Ontario Securities Commission, 21 O.R. (3d) 104, [1994] O.J. No. 2966 (QL) (C.A.) at para. 21 (Ainsley CA). In E.A. Manning CA, the Court noted that the Policy was held in Ainsley CA to have crossed the line between a non-mandatory guideline and a mandatory pronouncement having the same effect as a statutory instrument (E.A. Manning CA at para. 21). In effect, the Commission had already determined that the E.A. Manning parties were guilty of the practices set out in the Policy Statement (E.A. Manning Div. Ct. at paras. 40, 51-55).\n[22] In my view, the Commission\u2019s impugned Policy 1.10 and the Statement are fundamentally different in scope and effect. The Ontario Court of Appeal described Policy 1.10 as setting out \u201ca minutely detailed regime complete with prescribed forms, exemptions from the regime, and exceptions to the exemptions\u201d (Ainsley CA at para. 19). The prejudicial effects of the adoption by the Commission of the Policy on the E.A. Manning companies were both obvious and at the centre of the dispute before the Ontario courts.\n[23] In contrast, the Statement contains only general guidance. It is a one-page statement from the CTA that expressly preserves the appeal and review rights of air passengers. The Statement was issued by the CTA, and not by one or more of its individual members, and states that: \u201cany specific situation brought before the CTA will be examined on its merits\u2026\u201d Each air passenger retains all legal rights available to them under the Transportation Act and the FC Act, including the right to file a complaint with the CTA. If the complainant is not satisfied with the resulting decision, they have the right to file an appeal of the CTA\u2019s decision on a question of law or jurisdiction under subsection 41(1) of the Transportation Act or an application for judicial review of the decision in this Court.\n[24] The question for the Court is whether APR has established that the Statement prejudicially affected the rights of airline passengers whose flights were cancelled amidst the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. The test is one of causation (Democracy Watch at para. 43): Did the Statement cause the prejudicial effects outlined by APR?\n[25] APR submits that the Statement swayed the public and adversely affected passengers\u2019 refund rights because airlines relied on the Statement to refuse refund claims and issue vouchers, while credit card companies denied their clients\u2019 attempts to claim chargebacks.\n[26] APR distinguishes the record currently before the Court from that in May 2020 when the Court refused APR\u2019s motion for a mandatory interlocutory injunction to remove the Statement and webpage from the CTA\u2019s website. The Court found that the Statement did not affect \u201crights, impose legal obligations, or cause prejudicial effects on either APR or airline passengers\u201d (Air Passenger Rights v. Canada (Transportation Agency), 2020 FCA 92 at para. 27). APR argues that it has now filed uncontroverted evidence of such prejudicial effects and that the Statement is justiciable.\n[27] APR has filed no evidence that a COVID-19 complaint relating to the Statement was filed with the CTA. As a result, APR has not established that the Statement affected any complainant\u2019s legal rights or had prejudicial effects on a complaint. APR has also not demonstrated that the Statement was effectively a prejudgment of air passengers\u2019 refund rights due to COVID-19 flight cancellations (as in the E.A. Manning cases) or fettered the discretion of a CTA member to adjudicate a complaint (the issue addressed by the Court in Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers v. Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2020 FCA 196).\n[28] Instead, APR relies on unsworn, third-party evidence in the form of exhibits to the affidavit of Dr. Luk\u00e1cs to establish the Statement\u2019s alleged prejudicial effects. The evidence includes a series of email chains between air passengers and the CTA from March and April 2020 (Exhibits 96-99), in which air passengers requested information or assistance from the CTA regarding their right to a refund for cancelled flights or attempted refund claims, and\/or expressed their concerns with the Statement. The evidence includes a statement released by Sunwing to travel agents advising of its new policy to issue vouchers instead of refunds, \u201cconsistent with the \u201cruling\u201d made by the Canadian Transportation Agency on March 26, 2020\u201d (Exhibits 100-101). APR\u2019s evidence then sets out (i) communications between Canadian airlines and their passengers denying refund requests with reference to the Statement and the CTA\u2019s \u201capproval\u201d of the airlines\u2019 use of vouchers (Exhibits 102-106), (ii) information from travel agencies referencing the Statement (Exhibits 107-108), and (iii) a series of chargeback refusals in which airlines invoked the Statement to dispute air passengers\u2019 credit card chargebacks and credit card companies accepted the airlines\u2019 explanation (Exhibits 120-135).\n[29] At its core, APR\u2019s argument that the Statement is justiciable is based on the premise that the actions of third parties (airlines and credit card companies) taken in reliance on the Statement prejudicially affected air passengers\u2019 rights and access to refunds for cancelled flights in circumstances where refunds should arguably have been available to them. APR insists that the Statement had the practical effect of facilitating the airlines\u2019 retention of passengers\u2019 money without providing services.\n[30] APR\u2019s evidence and arguments are not persuasive. The actions of third parties are not the actions of the CTA, nor is the CTA responsible for the decisions taken by airlines and credit card companies. APR\u2019s evidence demonstrates only that third parties used the Statement to justify refund and credit card chargeback refusals. The prejudicial effects asserted by APR flow not from the Statement or the conduct of the CTA but from the interpretation and use of the Statement by third parties. APR asks the Court to consider the Statement from the public\u2019s perspective but there is little evidence in the record of that perspective outside of a limited number of email chains in which frustrated air travellers vented their dissatisfaction with the Statement. In any event, the public\u2019s possible interpretation of the Statement does not establish prejudicial effect or justiciability.\n[31] In concluding this section of my analysis, I find that the Statement and references to the Statement on the CTA Information webpage are not justiciable. APR has not established that the Statement affected or caused prejudicial effects on the rights of air passengers to refunds for flight cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While APR has demonstrated the frustrations experienced by a number of air travellers in dealing with Canadian airlines and credit card companies in the aftermath of mass flight cancellations, those frustrations were caused by the third parties. Similarly, any denial of refunds and chargeback credits was imposed or acceded to by the airlines and credit card companies. Third-parties\u2019 mischaracterization of the Statement, whether as a ruling or approval, was not endorsed by the CTA and does not transform the Statement into a mandatory pronouncement.\n[32] The Statement is written in simple language and conveys a possible way forward in unprecedented circumstances, subject to the adjudication of each case on its own merits. It is drafted using permissive language and addresses one topic. It does not purport to provide a detailed overview of the state of Canadian legislation and jurisprudence regarding the right to refunds, nor does the Statement alter an air passenger\u2019s legal entitlement to a refund for certain cancelled flights. Although APR asserts that the Statement misinforms the travelling public about their refund rights, it has pointed to no requirement that the CTA reference the relevant refund legislation, tariff and case law when issuing an interim statement that makes clear reference to travellers\u2019 ability to file a complaint despite the guidance in the Statement.\n[33] I now turn to the parties\u2019 submissions regarding the Court\u2019s recent decision in Sierra Club. Initially, APR focussed its request for judicial review on the Statement and related CTA webpage references. APR expands its challenge to the conduct of the CTA in its post-hearing submissions and asserts an independent ground of review regardless of the justiciability of the Statement, premised on its allegations of reasonable apprehension of bias. APR argues that its application raises legal and\/or jurisdictional issues that must be addressed by the Court as a supervisory court \u201cconsistent with the Court\u2019s constitutional and judicial review role\u201d.\n[34] By way of background, to establish its position that the CTA acted on the prompting and for the benefit of Canadian airlines in issuing the Statement, APR relies on Dr. Luk\u00e1cs\u2019 affidavit evidence that details emails and communications in the days leading up to March 25, 2020, among Canadian airline executives, representatives of Transport Canada, and senior CTA officers, notably Mr. Scott Streiner, then CTA Chair, and Ms. Marcia Jones, CTA\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer at the time.\n[35] In APR\u2019s narrative, these communications point to a regulator who acted in response to airline pressure, to assist those airlines to evade their obligations to provide refunds for cancelled flights. APR argues that this conduct was improper and gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. Conversely, the respondent submits that there is nothing suspicious in the communications between the CTA as regulator, Transport Canada and industry participants. Indeed, in the exigent circumstances of March 2020, such communications were inevitable and necessary. The respondent notes that there is no smoking gun in the communications that suggests bias in favour of the airlines.\n[36] The legislative framework for the Sierra Club decision was the complex federal impact assessment scheme established under the Impact Assessment Act, S.C. 2019, c. 28, s. 1 (the IAA). The IAA contemplated a three-phase regional assessment process: planning stage, regional assessment and, finally, decision making, including the making of a regulation by the Minister of the Environment (Sierra Club at para. 45). A number of issues were before the Court, only one of which is relevant to the present case: the validity of a March 2020 report (the Report) that resulted from a regional assessment of offshore oil and gas exploratory drilling in a defined area east of Newfoundland and Labrador.\n[37] The Federal Court concluded that the regional assessment and resulting Report were not amenable to judicial review (Ecology Action Centre v. Canada (Environment and Climate Change), 2021 FC 1367 at para. 32). On appeal, this Court agreed. Writing for the Court, Justice Goyette found that neither the regional assessment nor the Report were decisions \u201cbecause they did not affect \u2018legal rights, impose legal obligations, or cause prejudicial effects\u2019\u201d (Sierra Club at para. 46, citing Sganos at para. 6). Rights were affected or obligations imposed only at the third phase when the Minister decided whether to make a regulation excluding potential projects from project-specific assessments (Sierra Club at para. 47).\n[38] The Court continued, stating (at para. 61):\n[61] That said, just because a regional assessment, standing alone, is not amenable to judicial review, does not mean it is always immune from judicial review. If a regional assessment is materially deficient (unreasonable or procedurally unfair), the resulting regulation may be quashed on the basis that the Minister lacked the legal prerequisite set out in subsection 112(2) to make that regulation: FC Decision at paras. 26, 31, citing Trans Mountain at para. 201; Mikisew at paras. 108\u2013109. (emphasis in original)\n[39] APR relies on paragraph 61 to argue that Sierra Club confirms \u201cthat procedural fairness is an independent basis that is always justiciable, despite that the contents of the subject document may not be amenable to judicial review\u201d. APR states that its allegation of reasonable apprehension of bias is the primary issue in this application and that, if the Court finds reasonable apprehension of bias, it need not consider whether the Statement is justiciable.\n[40] APR explains its reading of paragraph 61 in its supplemental submissions. It argues that if a regional assessment under the IAA were prepared in a manner contrary to the requirements of procedural fairness, the resulting regulation could be struck down. This I agree with. APR then states, \u201c[b]y the same token, if the Statement gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, this Court can issue a writ of prohibition (i.e. injunction) and\/or a declaration, all pursuant to s. 18 of the Federal Courts Act\u201d.\n[41] APR\u2019s second statement finds no basis in paragraph 61 of Sierra Club. There, the Court does not suggest that a regional assessment or second-stage report could be subject to independent judicial action if prepared in procedurally flawed circumstances. Rather, the Court acknowledges that the resulting regulation may be struck down because the regional assessment, a legal prerequisite under the IAA, was materially deficient (whether unreasonable or procedurally unfair).\n[42] In the present case, the closest analogy is that of an air passenger complaint to the CTA. If a complaint were rejected by the CTA in reliance on the Statement, the Court on judicial review could be asked to grant the application and quash the CTA\u2019s decision because the Statement was procedurally unfair (e.g., because there was prejudgment or reasonable apprehension of bias). However, the analogy is far from perfect because the Statement does not have the status or role of a report under the IAA.\n[43] I find that Sierra Club does not support APR\u2019s argument that the Court may assess allegations of reasonable apprehension of bias before (or without) considering whether the Statement is justiciable. Paragraph 61 does not establish this principle. In addition, the paragraph cannot be read in isolation. The Court reviewed the question of justiciability in paragraphs 44-47 and concluded that neither the regional assessment nor the Report was amenable to judicial review. They did not \u201caffect legal rights, impose legal obligations or cause prejudicial effects\u201d (see, e.g., Toronto Port Authority at para. 29, Democracy Watch 2021 at para. 29, and Sganos at para. 6). In my view, the Court\u2019s decision in Sierra Club confirms the Court\u2019s existing jurisprudence regarding the requirements for justiciability.\n[44] This Court does not have plenary jurisdiction to intervene in the conduct of a federal board, commission or tribunal based on allegations of misconduct or perception of bias absent a matter in respect of which a remedy is available. Essentially, APR is asking the Court to censure the CTA regardless of the legal effects of its conduct. This is not the Court\u2019s role. At the admitted risk of repetition, for a remedy to be available a matter must \u201caffect legal rights, impose legal obligations, or cause prejudicial effects\u201d (Democracy Watch at para. 29). The Statement does not do so and it is not otherwise amenable to judicial review.\n2. Public interest standing\n[45] In light of my conclusion regarding the issue of justiciability, I need not consider the question of whether the Court should exercise its discretion to grant public standing to APR.\nIV. Conclusion and Costs\n[46] The Court\u2019s finding that the Statement is not amenable to judicial review is sufficient to dismiss this application for judicial review.\n[47] The respondent, as the successful party, seeks costs in the amount of $5,220.00, and attaches a Bill of Costs to its supplemental submissions.\n[48] APR submitted that, if successful, it should be awarded solicitor-client costs due to the public interest nature of the proceeding or, as an alternative, a lump sum award of $5,000.00. If unsuccessful, APR argues that there should be no costs award against it or at most an award of $1,000.00. APR emphasizes that it is a non-profit organization with a genuine interest in the protection of air passengers\u2019 rights and is not attempting to establish a private interest. APR also points to the superior ability of the respondent to absorb its own costs and emphasizes that there were no other litigants who could bring this application for judicial review in part because of the difficulty in obtaining evidence of the CTA\u2019s conduct.\n[49] There is no doubt that APR is a non-profit litigant with a long history (through Dr. Luk\u00e1cs) of genuine interest and involvement in the establishment and safeguarding of air passenger rights. I would add that it is clear that APR has expended considerable effort in furtherance of its belief in the merits of the application.\n[50] That said, I find little merit in certain of APR\u2019s submissions in support of either no costs award or a maximum costs award of $1,000.00. APR speculates that the Statement has deterred air passengers from filing CTA complaints but there is no evidence to this effect. The same is true of APR\u2019s assertion that its actions have ensured that the CTA maintain pertinent information rather than deleting records due to its \u201clax\u201d preservation practices. Finally, the mere fact that APR is a public interest litigant does not immunize it from costs awards: see, e.g., Greenpeace Canada v. Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FCA 114 at para. 79.\n[51] Taking these factors into account, the application will be dismissed with costs to the respondent in the amount of $3,000.00 inclusive of all disbursements and taxes.\n\"Elizabeth Walker\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nYves de Montigny C.J.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nJ.B.

The Minister of National Revenue (October 6, 2022), 2022\u2013379 (CPP) (TCC) (per St Hilaire J.) granting the respondent\u2019s motion to quash the appellant\u2019s appeal to the Tax Court under the Canada Pension Plan, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-8 (CPP), and dismissing the appeal.\n[2] Essentially, the appellant is seeking a transfer of contributions made to the Irish Single Public Service Pension Scheme in the course of his employment with University College Dublin for the period of November 1, 2019 to August 31, 2020, to the Canada Pension Plan.\n[3] The standard of review on this appeal is correctness for a question of law, and palpable and overriding error for a question of fact or mixed fact and law, where there is no extricable question of law: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. An error is palpable when it is plainly seen, and overriding when it affects the result: Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Canada, 2021 FCA 10, 456 D.L.R. (4th) 722 at para. 55.\n[4] We see no error that warrants our intervention. Section 26.1 of the CPP allows a request to be made to a CRA officer to rule on certain questions, including whether an employment is pensionable. A person concerned by the ruling may appeal it to the Minister under section 27. A person affected by a decision of the Minister under section 27 may, under section 28, appeal that decision to the Tax Court, which may vacate, confirm or vary the decision. It was open to the Tax Court, on the evidentiary record before it, to determine that there was no decision of the Minister under section 27, particularly given the appellant\u2019s acknowledgement of this fact at the hearing before the Tax Court.\n[5] The Tax Court of Canada is a statutory court. It derives its jurisdiction from statutory sources, such as the CPP. In this respect, the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Chaput v. Romain, 1955 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1955] S.C.R. 834, is of no assistance to the appellant.\n[6] Considering, without deciding, the appellant\u2019s argument that the Minister\u2019s alleged inaction regarding his request for a transfer of his contributions to the Irish Single Public Service Pension Scheme to the Canada Pension Plan provides him with a cause of action against the Minister, the Tax Court did not err in deciding that, in the absence of a section 27 decision, it had no jurisdiction under section 28 of the CPP to hear the appellant\u2019s appeal. This appeal will therefore be dismissed, with costs.\n\u201cGerald Heckman\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-225-22\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMIDJOHODO FRANCK GLOGLO v.

The appellants appeal from the Federal Court\u2019s judgment against them on June 30, 2022. In a summary trial, the Federal Court dismissed the appellants\u2019 motion for a declaration of ownership and their patent infringement action: 2022 FC 943 (per St-Louis J.) (file A-177-22).\nThe companion appeal. The appellants appeal from the Federal Court\u2019s order on June 15, 2022. The Federal Court struck out significant portions of their affidavit filed in the summary trial (file A-136-22).\nIn the summary trial, the Federal Court also dismissed the respondents\u2019 counterclaim. They have not appealed from the dismissal.\n[2] These are the reasons for judgment in both appeals. The original of these reasons shall be filed in A-177-22 and a copy shall be filed in A-136-22.\n[3] In the Federal Court, the appellants have brought an action against the respondents for infringement of their patents. But\u2014and this is the main question in this case\u2014do the patents belong to the appellants? If not, the appellants have no standing to sue for infringement and so their action must be dismissed.\n[4] The appellants say that the appellant, Mud Engineering Inc., owns the patents. The respondents say that the respondent, Secure Energy (Drilling Services) Inc., owns the patents.\n[5] At the center of this dispute was one Mr. An-Ming (Victor) Wu. Mr. Wu worked for Secure\u2019s predecessor, Marquis Fluids Inc., but later left for elsewhere. The ownership issue came down to a number of particular questions, including the following. What did Mr. Wu invent? When did he invent it? Was he working for Marquis (Secure) when he invented it or was he otherwise under an obligation to assign to Secure whatever he invented?\n[6] In the Federal Court, the appellants moved for a summary trial to resolve this ownership issue. The appellants and the respondents sought competing declarations of ownership.\n[7] Summary trials are not a time for parties to engage in strategic behaviour as far as the evidence is concerned. They are not a time to hold back evidence for later. Instead, the parties must put their best foot forward. If there are evidentiary shortcomings in a party\u2019s case in the summary trial, that party may well lose.\n[8] In this case, the parties must be taken to have put their best foot forward. In practical terms in this case, their foot forward very much came down to the testimony of two rival witnesses. For the appellants it was Mr. Wu. For the respondents it was Dr. Eric Rivard.\n[9] Who was more credible? Whose evidence was more believable? As we shall see, on these factually suffused questions the Federal Court came down firmly and overwhelmingly on the side of Dr. Rivard and the respondents.\n[10] The Federal Court began its analysis of ownership by noting that, absent evidence to the contrary, subsection 43(2) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, creates a prima facie presumption of both ownership and inventorship in a granted patent. Here, the presumption worked in favour of the appellants. Before us, no one contests this.\n[11] An evidentiary burden lies on the party contesting ownership. Here, it fell to the respondents to displace the presumption that one of the appellants, Mud Engineering Inc. (through Mr. Wu), was the true inventor. The presumption is a weak one. Again, before us, no one contests this.\n[12] The Federal Court found that the respondents had presented some evidence to displace the presumption. In this Court, the appellants do not contest that the presumption was displaced.\n[13] Once the presumption is displaced, the issue of ownership is to be decided on the balance of probabilities. In assessing this, including the state of the evidence before it, the Federal Court said it was not persuaded that the appellants had adduced enough admissible and credible evidence to establish an entitlement to a declaration of ownership. Thus, the Federal Court refused to give the appellants a declaration of ownership and dismissed their infringement action. In its words (at paras. 98 and 105), \u201cthere [was] a dearth of evidence from [the appellants]\u201d and \u201cextremely limited evidence\u201d to \u201cestablish that [the named inventor,] Mr. Wu invented what he disclosed in the [patents in issue]\u201d. \u201cDearth\u201d and \u201cextremely limited\u201d are strong words indeed. The main appeal is from this holding.\n[14] As for the respondents, the Federal Court also refused to give them the declaration of ownership they sought, again on the state of the evidence. But that refusal is not before us because the respondents have not cross-appealed against it.\n[15] In my view, the main appeal must be dismissed. In substance, the appellants ask us to reweigh the evidence before the Federal Court and re-do the Federal Court\u2019s findings on factually suffused questions of mixed fact and law. This we cannot do: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at para. 22.\n[16] The appellants raise questions about the Federal Court\u2019s choice of wording at some portions of its reasons, alleging that the Federal Court erred in law by slipping into the task of assessing validity of the patents, not ownership. I agree that issue can be taken with the word choice and phrasing of certain portions in the Federal Court\u2019s reasons. But appellate review is not an exercise in literary criticism. Indeed, \u201cthe craft of writing reasons\u201d is \u201can imprecise art suffused by difficult judgment calls that cannot be easily second-guessed\u201d: Mahjoub v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FCA 157, [2018] 2 F.C.R. 344, at para. 69. Instead, we must look at the real essence and true substance of what the Federal Court did, reading its reasons holistically and practically, in light of the record before it, without fastening onto matters of form. Once we do this, it can be seen that the Federal Court did not commit legal error or palpable and overriding error in its decision that is the subject of the main appeal.\n[17] The appellants also submit that the Federal Court\u2019s decision in the main appeal has created an absurd result: neither the appellants nor the respondents obtained a declaration that they own the patents and so, as a result, no one owns them. They raise the spectre that we now have patents that cannot be defended.\n[18] The result is not absurd. Courts do not declare that someone owns property unless they are satisfied they have the factual and legal bases to make that declaration. Here, after weighing the evidence before it, the Federal Court found that both sets of parties fell short of the mark. The Federal Court was entitled to so find, given the state of the evidence before it.\n[19] Further, the Federal Court\u2019s decision in the main appeal does not leave the parties without a remedy for an infringement of the patents in appropriate circumstances. The decision binds these two parties as against each other but does not bind them against third parties. Absent an abuse of process (see, e.g., Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79, 2003 SCC 63, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77), either remains free to contest an infringement of the patents by third parties and to succeed if, among other things, their ownership of the patents is contested and they are able to offer sufficient evidence proving ownership.\n[20] Now to the companion appeal. In this appeal, the appellants target some of the Federal Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings concerning some paragraphs in the affidavit of Mr. Wu, the named inventor. The companion appeal matters: if the appellants establish an error of law or palpable and overriding error in the Federal Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, the Federal Court\u2019s overall ruling in the main appeal might fall.\n[21] Some background to the companion appeal is needed.\n[22] In the Federal Court, the appellants chose not to tender expert evidence in the summary trial. Instead, the appellants sought to rely solely on the lay affidavit evidence of Mr. Wu. The Federal Court found that Mr. Wu\u2019s affidavit included expert evidence, untranslated foreign language evidence (contrary to Rule 68(1) of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106), hearsay evidence, irrelevant evidence, and matters covered by settlement privilege. It excluded from evidence the affected portions.\n[23] Some of the Federal Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are open to doubt. For example, I query the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that some of Mr. Wu\u2019s evidence was covered by settlement privilege. There may not have been a litigious dispute in contemplation between the parties at all material times. I also query the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that some of Mr. Wu\u2019s evidence was inadmissible as hearsay and opinion evidence. Many of the paragraphs do not appear to constitute hearsay because they do not appear to have been tendered for the truth of their contents. A number of paragraphs also do not contain opinion evidence offered by a lay person and should not have been excluded on that ground.\n[24] If we find that the Federal Court erred in law in these respects, we do not stop there. An appellate court\u2019s finding that a first-instance court committed reversible error is one thing. But whether it should grant a remedy for that error and, if so, what sort of remedy, is quite another. A number of remedies are available to address errors of law, including sending the matter back to the Federal Court for redetermination: Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, s. 52(b).\n[25] And sometimes no remedy should be given at all. An appellate court will send the matter back for redetermination only if, among other things, there is some possibility that the error might have changed the outcome. Sending a case back to a first-instance court for redetermination, when the outcome would have remained the same despite the error, makes no sense.\n[26] In assessing this, the appellate court must follow the appellate standard of review. It must take as given all of the first-instance court\u2019s factual findings, weighings, and credibility assessments that are unsullied by legal error or palpable and overriding error and then assess whether the outcome might be different when the correct law is applied to the case. A finding of some sort of reversible error on the part of the first-instance court does not give the appellate court a licence to act de novo, i.e., to re-do or rerun the case, reassess the evidence, and replace the first-instance court\u2019s unsullied factual findings with its own.\n[27] Under subparagraph 52(b)(i) of the Federal Courts Act, this Court can also give the judgment the first-instance court should have given. The need for the appellate court to follow the appellate standard of review applies here again. This Court must take as given all of the first-instance court\u2019s factual findings, weighings, and credibility assessments that are unsullied by legal error or palpable and overriding error. It cannot override them.\n[28] These limits on appellate courts matter especially in this context, a summary trial. A summary trial is meant to be a single litigation event that, if possible on the facts and the law, will end the proceedings or one or more issues: quickly, one way or the other, once and for all. An unwarranted, improper and pointless re-do and rerun of a summary trial runs against its purpose\u2014to determine disputes quickly and finally.\n[29] In this case, sending the summary trial back to the Federal Court for redetermination makes no sense. The outcome would have been the same.\n[30] The all-important contest between Mr. Wu and Dr. Rivard was a mismatch. Even if the Federal Court erred in certain evidentiary rulings, it still would have been a mismatch. Taking the unsullied evidentiary and credibility findings of the Federal Court at face value, Mr. Wu\u2019s evidence counted for very little:\nThe Federal Court found Mr. Wu not to be credible. This was not a marginal or difficult call. The Federal Court found that Mr. Wu \u201coften evaded questions or provided answers unrelated to the questions\u201d in cross-examination and, overall, had \u201cserious credibility issues\u201d. He did not \u201ccome across as a direct, sincere and candid fact witness\u201d. In the end, the Federal Court \u201cgranted very little weight\u201d to his testimony (at paras. 94 and 97).\nBy a wide margin, the Federal Court simply could not find a basis for the appellants owning the patents as a result of Mr. Wu\u2019s work. Mr. Wu \u201cdid not exhibit the facility of understanding of an inventor\u201d, \u201ccould not articulate his own [alleged] invention\u201d, \u201ccould not establish that the drilling fluids he worked on while at Marquis\u2026were completely different than the ones covered by the [patents in issue]\u201d that he supposedly invented later, did not \u201cexplain the work that [led] him to the filing of [the patents in issue]\u201d, was not present for some experiments, and \u201cwas not able to provide lab book or documentation supporting the experiments\u201d, and \u201cMr. Wu provided no evidence relating to actual work he did to develop the invention disclosed in the 969 [p]rovisional application\u201d (at paras. 95-96, 103-104).\nAs well, Mr. Wu\u2019s testimony was \u201cproblematic\u201d. He was \u201cunprepared, acknowledged that he had not reviewed the patents at issue in ten (10) years, had not carefully read [the patents] even when they were filed, did not understand portions of his own patents and likewise, did not understand portions of his own affidavit\u201d (at paras. 94 and 101).\nIn an important finding of fact, the Federal Court held that even if it erred on the issue of opinion evidence\u2014even if the portions of Mr. Wu\u2019s affidavit concerning the patents in question and a technical primer were admissible as expert opinion\u2014it would have given those portions absolutely no weight (para. 94).\nOverall, the appellants provided a \u201cdearth of evidence\u201d and \u201cextremely limited evidence\u201d to establish that Mr. Wu invented what was disclosed in the patents in question (at paras. 98 and 105). In the view of the Federal Court, the appellants failed to fill key gaps in their position (at para. 93). The evidence said to have been wrongly excluded would not have filled those gaps.\n[31] In his testimony, Dr. Rivard strongly favoured the respondents\u2019 position and rejected the appellants\u2019 position. The Federal Court found Dr. Rivard \u201cknowledgeable, independent, credible and thorough, and was solid and frank\u2026under cross-examination\u201d, and \u201cstraightforward, frank, clear and engaging\u201d. It gave Dr. Rivard\u2019s opinion \u201cmuch weight\u201d (at para. 99).\n[32] In the view of the Federal Court, the appellants fell substantially short of the threshold for a declaration of ownership in their favour. This was so even taking into account possible legal errors on some evidentiary issues. Had this been a closer contest between Mr. Wu and Dr. Rivard, the evidence the Federal Court excluded might have made a difference. But this case was far from close. Sending it back to the Federal Court for redetermination would be an exercise in futility.\n[33] Two further issues need to be addressed.\n[34] First, in the companion appeal, the appellants challenge the Federal Court\u2019s order because it was \u201cbrief\u2026without reasons\u201d. In particular, the appellants submit that the Federal Court did not set out the legal test for settlement privilege and so its reasons are legally insufficient.\n[35] I disagree. In three-and-a-half pages of single spaced reasons set out in its order, the Federal Court met the legal standard for sufficiency of reasons: see R. v. Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869 at para. 55. The non-mention of some evidence in the reasons does not mean that the court ignored that evidence; to the contrary, there is a presumption that in reaching its decision the first-instance court considered all of the evidence before it: Housen at para. 46; Manitoba v. Canada, 2015 FCA 57, 470 N.R. 187 at para. 26.\n[36] It is true that the Federal Court did not explicitly set out the test for settlement privilege. However, it did state that it drew upon the respondents\u2019 written submissions. In their written submissions, the respondents cited a leading Supreme Court authority on point, Sable Offshore Energy Inc. v. Ameron International Corp., 2013 SCC 37, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 623, that sets out the relevant principles on settlement privilege. Reasons are to be read not literally with a dictionary in our hand, but holistically in light of the record before the Court, including the submissions and authorities put to the Court: Housen and Manitoba, above. This Court can discern the basis upon which the Federal Court decided the settlement privilege issue. The Federal Court\u2019s reasons were adequate.\n[37] Second, in the main appeal, the parties offer submissions on the unsettled legal issue of who bears the burden of proof in summary trials. In this Court, this issue is open. It has never been decided explicitly in considered reasons for judgment. In particular, I do not consider that ViiV Healthcare Company v. Gilead Sciences Canada, Inc., 2021 FCA 122, 460 D.L.R. (4th) 272 decided it.\n[38] Given the state of the evidentiary record as found by the Federal Court\u2014one that fell well short of establishing the appellants\u2019 ownership of the patents\u2014it is unnecessary in this case to say anything further about this issue. As the respondents put it, \u201c[based] upon the [Federal Court\u2019s] balancing of evidence, it is immaterial where the legal burden of proving inventorship lies\u201d: respondents\u2019 memorandum of fact and law at para. 76. In my view, the issue of who bears the legal burden of proof in summary trials should await full submissions and thorough consideration in a case that calls for it.\n[39] My colleague, while substantially agreeing with much of the above, suggests that the Federal Court erred in dismissing the appellants\u2019 infringement claim. I disagree.\n[40] In this Court, the appellants did not offer independent grounds, such as those offered by my colleague, for not dismissing the infringement claim. The entire record before us, including the notice of appeal and the appellants\u2019 memorandum of fact of law shows us this. Throughout, the appellants have implicitly accepted that if the appellants did not establish ownership in the summary trial and no error of law or palpable and overriding error were present in the evidentiary rulings, the appellants\u2019 infringement claim should be dismissed. As well, in the Federal Court, no party took the view that the granting of judgment, one way or the other, would be unjust under Rule 216(6).\n[41] This makes sense. As explained in paragraph 28 above, the whole point of a summary trial is to achieve a once-and-for-all, final determination of one or more issues in dispute. Thus, in the summary trial, the appellants had to put their best foot forward and adduce all the evidence they had on the issue of ownership: see also Rule 216(1). Having put their best foot forward, they lost on the ownership issue.\n[42] That is the end of the matter. Absent a finding of ownership by the appellants, they cannot maintain an action for infringement. The Federal Court was right to dismiss the action. The dismissal was warranted by the poor state of the appellants\u2019 evidence before it. We cannot interfere with the Federal Court\u2019s dismissal of the action unless there is an error of law or palpable and overriding error. There is none here.\n[43] The consequences of viewing summary trials in a different way are startling. If parties such as the appellants can fail on the ownership issue at the summary trial but then can rerun the ownership issue at a full trial in order to have standing to bring an infringement action, what value is a summary trial in the litigation process? It would be nothing more than a consequence-free dress rehearsal for a later trial.\n[44] And it would be one-sided too. A party wins at a summary trial? The case is over. The party loses at a summary trial? It need not worry. It can proceed to trial and try again.\n[45] If summary trials work that way, why should a party bother to adduce all possible evidence, i.e., put one\u2019s best foot forward, at the summary trial? If unsuccessful, the party can rerun the case before a different judge, even with exactly the same evidence. Or despite the obligation to put one\u2019s best foot forward in the summary trial and having lost, the party could try harder, come up with more evidence, and try its luck before a different judge.\n[46] My colleague suggests that the infringement action should not have been dismissed because the appellants benefit from the statutory presumption of ownership. But the Federal Court found that the presumption was easily rebutted on the state of the evidence before it\u2014a finding that no party challenged in this Court. On this record, we have no business restoring the presumption of ownership in order to keep this proceeding alive and permit the appellants a rerun of the issues in the summary trial.\n[47] Allowing a rerun in these circumstances would subvert the purpose of summary trials: Hryniak v. Mauldin, 2014 SCC 7, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 87. Summary trials, if granted, are meant to end issues or end the entire litigation summarily and once and for all, not protract them.\n[48] No longer having the benefit of the statutory presumption and not having established their ownership of the disputed patents in the summary trial, the appellants could no longer maintain their claim against the respondents for infringement. The Federal Court was right to dismiss the claim.\n[49] Therefore, I would dismiss both appeals. The respondents ask for costs in the amount of $15,000 in the main appeal and $10,000 in the companion appeal. The appellants agree with that quantum if the respondents are successful. Therefore, I would grant the respondents their costs in those amounts.\n\u201cDavid Stratas\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nJ.B. Laskin J.A.\u201d MONAGHAN J.A. (Dissenting Reasons)\n[50] In my view, the Federal Court erred in concluding that the appellants bore the onus of establishing that Mud Engineering Inc. (Mud) owns the patents in issue in order to succeed on their motion for summary trial. This led the Federal Court to err in dismissing the appellants\u2019 action for infringement. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal from the Federal Court\u2019s judgment on the motion for summary trial. Before I explain my reasons for this conclusion, I will briefly address three other matters.\n[51] First, I agree entirely with my colleague\u2019s comments on the evidentiary rulings concerning Mr. Wu\u2019s affidavit, and his conclusion that any errors in those rulings would not change the outcome of this appeal. Thus, I concur in the dismissal of the companion appeal.\n[52] Second, I agree that this Court did not decide who bears the burden of proof in a summary trial in ViiV Healthcare Company v. Gilead Sciences Canada, Inc., 2021 FCA 122, 460 D.L.R. (4th) 272 [ViiV].\n[53] Finally, I take no issue with my colleague\u2019s conclusion that the Federal Court did not err in declining to grant the appellants a declaration that Mud owns the patents in dispute.\n[54] However, in my view, the appellants did not need that declaration to succeed on the summary trial. In my view, the Federal Court erred in dismissing the appellants\u2019 infringement action because they did not prove Mud was the owner and Mr. Wu was the inventor.\nI. Background [55] To place my analysis in context, some additional background may be helpful.\n[56] The motion for a summary trial arose in the context of the appellants\u2019 action against the respondents for infringement of two patents. In their statement of claim, the appellants stated as a fact that Mud owns those patents. This can hardly be surprising given that the patentee and those persons claiming through it are the persons able to bring an infringement action: Patent Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, s. 55. Mud is the owner and An-Ming (Victor) Wu is a named inventor in the patents in dispute. Among other relief, in their statement of claim the appellants sought a declaration that the patents were valid and have been owned by Mud at all relevant times.\n[57] The respondents issued a statement of defence and counterclaim (SDC) advancing a number of defences to the appellants\u2019 infringement action, including non-infringement, implied licence to use, and invalidity on the basis of anticipation, obviousness, overbreadth, inutility, and insufficient disclosure. However, the motion for summary trial arose from the respondents\u2019 claim that one of them, Secure Energy (Drilling Services) Inc. (Secure Drilling), rather than Mud, is the owner of the subject matter of the disputed patents. This claim was advanced in the SDC both as a defence to the infringement action and as a basis for Secure Drilling\u2019s counterclaim.\n[58] In particular, the respondents denied \u201cthat Mud Engineering and\/or Mr. Wu are the owner or inventor\u201d of the disputed patents and plead \u201cthat the subject matter disclosed in and claimed by the [disputed patents] is owned by Secure Drilling\u201d such that Mud held legal title as trustee for Secure Drilling (SDC at paras. 28, 43, 89-90). The respondents\u2019 reasons for these assertions are set out in the immediately following paragraphs of the SDC (at paras. 29-44) and are repeated as part of their counterclaim. Their reasons may be summarized as follows:\ni)Mr. Wu worked on or made the inventions while he was employed by Marquis Fluids Inc. (Marquis), a predecessor of Secure Drilling, and thus owed a duty to assign the inventions to Marquis\u2014now Secure Drilling: see SDC at paras. 31, 37, 40 and 79;\nii)Mr. Wu did not make the inventions, because they overlap with other patents owned by the respondents, and Jay Brockhoff (a Secure Drilling employee formerly employed by Marquis) was the inventor or co-inventor: see SDC at paras. 12(a), 17, 20, 32-36 and 41; and\niii)Mr. Wu misappropriated confidential and proprietary information belonging to Marquis and used it to make the inventions after he left the employ of Marquis: see SDC at paras. 12(b), 38, 40 and 80-82.\n[59] Among other relief, in their SDC the respondents sought a declaration that the subject matter of the disputed patents is rightfully owned by Secure Drilling and an order pursuant to section 52 of the Patent Act directing that the records in the patent office be amended to reflect that ownership: see SDC at para. 62(c).\n[60] Importantly, the respondents did not allege that anyone else was the inventor or owner. Simply put, their position was Secure Drilling\u2014not Mud\u2014was the owner and Mr. Brockhoff\u2014not Mr. Wu\u2014was the inventor.\nII. Motion for summary trial [61] Given these competing claims to ownership of the subject matter of the patents, the appellants brought a motion for \u201cthe adjudication of the title\u201d to the patents by summary trial. The notice of motion sought an order declaring that Mud is the owner of the disputed patents, dismissing Secure Drilling\u2019s counterclaim of ownership in the subject matter of those patents, the related relief, and costs of the motion.\n[62] The parties and the Federal Court agreed that the onus of establishing the appropriateness of a summary trial rests with the moving party. The Federal Court was satisfied that the appellants met that onus. The dispute centred on what came next\u2014which party bore the onus on the issue to be determined on the summary trial. Each party approached the motion with a different view as to where the burden lay.\n[63] The appellants argued that the onus lies with the party that would bear it on the issue in the underlying action. Here, said the appellants, the respondents bore the onus of proving that Secure Drilling is the rightful owner or co-owner because they raised the ownership issue in their defence and counterclaim. Accordingly, the appellants explained, the facts in their notice of motion focused on responding to the three bases on which the respondents alleged Secure Drilling is the owner, not Mud: reasons at paras. 20, 31.\n[64] The respondents argued that the legal burden lies with the party raising the issue in the summary trial. The Federal Court described their position as \u201cthe burden of proof on the summary trial pertains to what is raised in the motion, not to what is raised in the underlying action\u201d: reasons at para. 21. Accordingly, said the respondents, the appellants \u201cbore the burden to prove the ownership allegation that they raised on their Motion for summary trial\u201d and the onus of \u201c[proving] on a balance of probabilities, that Mud\u2026 is the rightful owner\u2026 to be entitled to the ownership declaration they seek\u201d: reasons at paras. 21, 76.\n[65] The Federal Court agreed with the respondents, relying largely on ViiV, and rejecting the appellants\u2019 assertion that ViiV did not consider where onus lies. The Federal Court concluded:\n[29] ...[T]he relative burden can be shifted in a motion for summary trial scenario because it is the party who is asserting a particular fact or legal conclusion in the motion for summary trial that bears the burden to prove it on a balance of probabilities. ...\n[30] Here, [the appellants] are the moving party and seek a declaration that [Mud] owns the Disputed Patents, based on a particular set of allegations.\n[31] [The appellants] submit that, in the present Motion, they only put into issue the facts pertaining to [the respondents\u2019] assertion that [Secure Drilling] is the \u201ctrue owner\u201d of the Disputed Patents. As I mentioned earlier, they add that all the facts referenced in their Notice of Motion are in response to the three (3) bases of ownership that were alleged by [the respondents] in their Defence and Counterclaim. However, [the appellants are] the moving party and based on [ViiV], [the appellants] bear the burden to prove the allegations they raised in their Motion for summary trial by relevant evidence and the application of appropriate law.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[66] However, the Federal Court also said the respondents had a burden to establish that Secure Drilling owns the disputed patents: reasons at para. 34.\n[67] Neither the appellants nor the respondents met the burden the Federal Court said they had to meet. Because the appellants did not establish that Mr. Wu is the inventor and Mud owns the patents, the Federal Court declined to grant the appellants the declaration of ownership they sought. But it went further. It concluded that \u201csince they have not established that [Mud] owns the Disputed Patents, the underlying action must be dismissed as well\u201d: reasons at paras. 105-106.\n[68] On the other hand, because the respondents did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, the allegations they raised in the motion or that Secure Drilling owns or co-owns the disputed patents, the Federal Court did not grant them a declaration of ownership, but dismissed their counterclaim: reasons at paras. 6, 147.\nIII. The appeal [69] The appellants submit the Federal Court erred in law by finding the burden of proof applicable on the issue to be decided on a summary trial rests with the party making an assertion without regard to who would carry that burden at trial. They submit the Federal Court should have placed the persuasive burden on the party challenging ownership of the patents\u2014here the respondents\u2014who would bear that burden at trial. They say the Federal Court erred because it determined the ownership issue twice, rather than determining which party had the persuasive burden to prove that Mud was not the owner and Mr. Wu was not the inventor\u2014a burden the appellants say the respondents bore but did not meet.\n[70] I agree the Federal Court erred.\nA. What was the consequence of the focus on burden of proof? [71] There is no doubt that the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion on the burden of proof was determinative of the motion. This is evident in its framing of the issues, the lengthy discussion of burden (reasons at paras. 17-35), the number of times it states that the burden rests with the appellants (reasons at paras. 6, 40, 76, 90, 93, 105, 110) and its express statement that \u201cthe determination of where the burden lies on a motion for summary trial is dispositive in these proceedings\u201d: reasons at para. 35.\n[72] However, an assertion that Mud is not the rightful owner is an attack on the validity of the patent: Eli Lilly Canada v. Apotex Inc., 2015 FC 875, 132 C.P.R. (4th) 319 at para. 189, aff\u2019d on other grounds 2016 FCA 267, 142 C.P.R. (4th) 171, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 23868 (27 April 2017); A. Pellerin et Fils Lt\u00e9e. v. Enterprises Denis Darveau Inc., (1994), 59 C.P.R. (3d) 511, 92 F.T.R. 137; Trojan Technologies Inc. v. Suntec Environmental Inc., 2003 FC 825, 26 C.P.R. 417; Patent Act, s. 43.\n[73] The burden to establish invalidity rests with the party making that claim. Here, the respondents attacked Mud\u2019s ownership (and so the validity) of the patent. They based their attack solely on their assertion that Secure Drilling was the owner of the subject matter of the claims and Mr. Brockhoff was the inventor or co-inventor.\n[74] The Federal Court held that the onus to establish those facts rested with the respondents. I agree, but principally because the respondents advanced those facts to challenge Mud\u2019s ownership (and so validity) of the patents in support of the relief the respondents sought\u2014dismissal of the infringement action, a change to the records in the patent office, and a right to pursue their counterclaim\u2014and, yes, a declaration of ownership.\n[75] However, it is equally clear that the Federal Court concluded, based on its view of what ViiV decided concerning onus in a summary trial, the appellants had to prove Mud\u2019s ownership. It focused on Mud\u2019s request for a declaration of ownership, rather than on the substance of the issue before it.\nB. What was the issue on the summary trial? [76] The substance of the issue on summary trial was the respondents\u2019 challenge to the appellants\u2019 ownership of the patent. In my view, the Federal Court misunderstood the nature of the motion before it. It did not approach the motion for adjudication of title as one brought in the context of the respondents\u2019 challenge to validity of the patents in defence of an infringement claim.\n[77] Rather, it viewed the motion as requiring it to answer two independent questions: (i) Did the appellants establish that Mud owns the patents so it is entitled to a declaration of ownership? (ii) Did the respondents establish that Secure Drilling owns the patents so it is entitled to a declaration of ownership? The Federal Court appears to have concluded that these questions addressed all of the issues raised on the motion.\n[78] In characterizing the motion, the Federal Court focused only on one aspect of the relief sought\u2014the declarations of ownership\u2014rather than the substance of the motion. This is clear from how the Federal Court framed the issues before it ((C) and (D) in reasons at para. 15), how it analyzed those issues, and what the Federal Court said about the onus:\n[33] In this Motion, [the appellants] bear the burden to prove, on balance of probabilities, the facts they raised to assert ownership of the Disputed Patents and obtain the declaration of ownership they seek.\n[34] On the other hand, [the respondents] assert that Mud cannot own the Disputed Patents and that [Secure Drilling] owns the Disputed Patents. [The respondents] thus raise their own set of allegations to support their ownership claim. [The respondents] bear that burden. In each instance, the burden is the usual burden in civil cases \u2013 a balance of probabilities.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[79] Nowhere does the Federal Court meaningfully engage with an analysis of what is necessary to grant the other relief sought\u2014in the case of the appellants, dismissal of that portion of the respondents\u2019 counterclaim based on Secure Drilling\u2019s ownership and, in the case of the respondents, dismissal of the appellants\u2019 infringement action. And yet, the Federal Court granted both of those remedies, in both cases because the party against whom the remedy was sought did not prove ownership of the patent. Remarkably, despite the Federal Court\u2019s focus on what the parties had to prove to be entitled to declarations of ownership, its judgment says nothing about the declarations.\n[80] In my view, the Federal Court was required to go beyond the manner in which the appellants framed their motion and discern the motion\u2019s \u201creal essence\u201d and \u201cessential character\u201d: Leahy v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FCA 145, 323 A.C.W.S. (3d) 406 at para. 4, citing Canada (National Revenue) v. JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc., 2013 FCA 250, [2014] 2 F.C.R. 557 [JP Morgan] at paras. 49-50. The Federal Court \u201cmust gain \u2018a realistic appreciation\u2019 of the [motion\u2019s] \u2018essential character\u2019 by reading it holistically and practically without fastening onto matters of form\u201d: JP Morgan at para. 50. The context in which the motion arose is relevant to identifying its real essence and essential character.\n[81] The respondents alleged that Mr. Wu is not the inventor because Mr. Brockhoff is. The respondents alleged that Mud is not the owner because Secure Drilling is. Based on those claims in their SDC, the respondents sought dismissal of the infringement action, a declaration Secure Drilling was the owner of the subject matter of the disputed patents, and an order that the records in the patent office be changed. This is the context in which the appellants brought their motion for summary trial. This is the explanation for the appellants \u201c[asserting] that the facts referenced in their Notice of Motion were made in response to the three (3) bases of ownership that were alleged by [the respondents] in their [SDC]\u201d: reasons at para. 20 [emphasis in original].\n[82] The essence of the appellants\u2019 motion was dismissal of the respondents\u2019 counterclaim and defence to the infringement action based on the respondents\u2019 assertion the patents were invalid because Secure Drilling, not Mud, owns the subject matter of the patents. The appellants\u2019 clear objective was to resolve that particular claim to ownership so the trial could proceed on all other matters\u2014including the appellants\u2019 infringement action and the respondents\u2019 other challenges to validity of the patent.\n[83] At the summary trial, the respondents were wholly unsuccessful in establishing their claims that Mr. Brockhoff is an inventor and Secure Drilling is an owner. The Federal Court was \u201cleft searching through [the respondents\u2019] submissions to infer [the respondents\u2019] arguments in support of the claim and allegations of ownership\u2026and for the pieces of evidence that precisely support each of these allegations\u201d: reasons at para. 118. Appropriately, in my view, the Federal Court drew an adverse inference from the respondents\u2019 failure to adduce evidence from Mr. Brockhoff, the alleged inventor\/co-inventor, employed by the respondents when the motion was heard: reasons at para. 141.\n[84] The Federal Court found \u201cno evidence that Mr. Wu \u2026appropriated confidential or proprietary information\u201d: reasons at para. 136. It found that the respondents \u201cfailed to establish that Mr. Brockhoff made the alleged contribution to the Disputed Patents\u201d: reasons at para. 140. The respondents \u201ctendered no evidence from any witness with personal knowledge of the purported facts underlying\u201d their claim that \u201cMr. Wu worked on the subject matter of the Disputed Patents\u201d while an employee at Marquis: reasons at paras. 145-46 [emphasis in original].\n[85] The Federal Court \u201c[could not] conclude that [the respondents] have established, on a balance of probabilities, that [Secure Drilling] owns or co-owns the Disputed Patents\u201d: reasons at para. 147. Because the respondents failed in proving their allegations, they were not entitled to a declaration Secure Drilling is the owner.\n[86] While I take no issue with this conclusion, the Federal Court\u2019s analysis focused on what the respondents needed to establish to obtain the declaration they sought. The Federal Court does not address the essence of the motion\u2014the respondents\u2019 challenge to the validity of the patents through their claim that Secure Drilling, not Mud, is the owner. In my view, the respondents needed to prove their ownership not only to pursue their counterclaim based on ownership, but critically to have the appellants\u2019 infringement action dismissed because, they said, Secure Drilling is the owner. The Federal Court is clear\u2014the respondents\u2019 did not establish any of their allegations.\n[87] Indeed, it is significant that the Federal Court did not find that Mr. Wu is not the inventor, nor that Mud is not the owner\u2014only that the appellants were not entitled to a declaration of ownership based on the evidence they led. The Federal Court did not order any change to the records at the patent office.\n[88] Thus, until a court determines otherwise, as against the world, Mr. Wu is the inventor and Mud is the owner of the disputed patents. As against the world, the patents in dispute are presumed to be valid: Patent Act, s. 43.\n[89] To be clear, there would be no rerun or re-do of the ownership issue at trial. The respondents\u2019 failure to establish Secure Drilling is the owner brings their attack on ownership to an end. That is the value of the summary trial in the litigation process. It is not consequence-free.\nC. Is a declaration of ownership necessary? [90] I take no issue with the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that neither party was entitled to a declaration of ownership. Declaratory relief is a discretionary remedy: Solosky v. Her Majesty the Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 821, 105 D.L.R. (3d) 745 at 832-33 (S.C.R.). Thus, even if one of the parties had met the onus the Federal Court said they had to meet, the Federal Court was not required to grant a declaration.\n[91] But, in these circumstances, a declaration in favour of the appellants would add nothing. Mud, as named patentee in the patent office records, is the owner and does not need a declaration to that effect: Computalog Ltd. v. Comtech Logging Ltd. (1992), 44 C.P.R. (3d) 77, 34 A.C.W.S. (3d) 830 at 92 (C.P.R.) (F.C.A.).\n[92] In other words, a declaration of ownership is superfluous to the appellants\u2019 right to pursue an infringement action.\n[93] The respondents point to Milliken & Co. v. Interface Flooring Systems (Canada) Inc., [1998] 3 FC 103, aff\u2019d 5 C.P.R. (4th) 209 (FCA) [Milliken]; Consolboard Inc. v. MacMillan Bloedel (Saskatchewan) Ltd., [1978] 2 A.C.W.S. 215, 39 C.P.R. (2d) 191 (F.C.T.D), rev\u2019d on appeal but reaffirmed Consolboard Inc. v. MacMillan Bloedel (Saskatchewan) Ltd., [1981] 1 S.C.R. 504, 122 D.L.R. (3d) 203 [Consolboard]; Milano Pizza Ltd. v. 6034799 Canada Inc., 2018 FC 1112, 159 C.P.R. (4th) 275 [Milano Pizza]; and 671905 Alberta Inc. v. Q'Max Solutions Inc., 2003 FCA 241, 27 C.P.R. (4th) 385, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 29926 (29 April 2004) [Q\u2019Max]; and Laboratoires Servier, Adir, Oril Industries, Servier Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2008 FC 825, 67 C.P.R. (4th) 241, aff\u2019d 2009 FCA 222, 75 C.P.R. (4th) 443, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 33357 (25 March 2010) [Laboratoires]. The respondents say these cases support the proposition that it was incumbent on Mud to prove Mr. Wu was the inventor so Mud could establish its standing to bring the infringement action.\n[94] I disagree.\n[95] While none of these cases expressly considered who bore the onus of proving ownership in a context similar to this case, there are other distinctions. Consolboard and Q\u2019Max dealt with alleged flaws in a chain of title because of failures in the assignments of the patents. Milliken and Milano Pizza also addressed a chain of title issue, albeit in the context of copyright. They turned on subsection 13(4) of the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-42. It provides that no assignment of copyright is valid unless in writing signed by the owner or its duly authorized agent.\n[96] This is not a case about flaws in a chain of title and it is not a case governed by the Copyright Act. Here, the alleged flaw in title\u2014that Secure Drilling is the owner, not Mud, and that Mr. Brockhoff is the inventor not Mr. Wu\u2014is not grounded in a failed assignment of the patent.\n[97] But critically, in each of these cases the evidence established the correct owner\/inventor\/copyright holder. Here the only offered alternative inventor and owner, Mr. Brockhoff and Secure Drilling, respectively, were not satisfactorily proven. The Federal Court expressly said the respondents had not established either allegation: reasons at para. 47.\n[98] Laboratoires dealt with standing to bring an infringement claim as a person claiming under the named patentee. Again, that is not the issue here. I see nothing in the record suggesting the respondents took issue with the appellants\u2019 standing to advance an infringement claim if Secure Drilling is not the true owner.\n[99] No doubt the declarations the parties sought on the motion and their onus submissions confused matters. Had the appellants sought only dismissal of the respondents\u2019 defence and counterclaim based on Secure Drilling\u2019s asserted ownership, the Federal Court may have come to a different conclusion, although I confess some uncertainty on this given its comments on onus. However, that is the essence of what they sought. The respondents bore the onus on any challenge to validity\u2014including ownership.\nD. Did the appellants have to prove other facts they asserted? [100] The respondents suggested that the Federal Court could \u201cgive [the respondents] the choice about whether they want title to the Disputed Patents or that the Disputed Patents be declared invalid.\u201d: reasons at para. 109. The Federal Court said it would not entertain that remedy because validity was not an issue in the motion for summary trial. A challenge to ownership is a challenge to validity. However, I take the Federal Court here to be speaking of the other challenges to validity the respondents raised\u2014anticipation, obviousness, overbreadth, lack of utility and insufficient disclosure.\n[101] Notwithstanding its recognition that validity in those senses was not in issue, the Federal Court said it was \u201cnecessary for [the appellants] to establish, on balance of probabilities, the facts they raised hence, notably, that the various drilling fluids that Mr. Wu worked on while at Marquis were of a completely different type than the Disputed Patents\u201d: reasons at paras. 93, 96, 101.\n[102] I cannot agree.\n[103] While the appellants asserted that the drilling fluids were different from those Mr. Wu worked on while at Marquis, they did so in response to the respondents\u2019 claim that Mr. Wu worked on the subject matter of the patents while at Marquis. The respondents made this claim in support of their allegation Secure Drilling owns the subject matter of the patents. But the respondents\u2019 failed to establish that Secure Drilling was the owner. To then ask the appellants to prove that the fluids are \u201cof a completely different type\u201d did more than put aspects of validity not raised on the motion in issue. It required the appellants to prove validity simply because, to defend against the respondents\u2019 challenge to one aspect of validity\u2014ownership\u2014they asserted a fact. Once the Federal Court concluded the respondents\u2019 challenge failed, facts alleged by the appellants to further support that conclusion had no relevance.\nE. Why did the Federal Court dismiss the infringement action? [104] It is clear that the Federal Court granted the appellants the essence of what they sought on the motion for summary trial\u2014dismissal of the counterclaim\u2014because the respondents failed to prove their allegations that Mr. Brockhoff is the inventor and Secure Drilling is the owner. In other words, the respondents did not establish that the patent is invalid.\n[105] In contrast, the Federal Court did not find that Mud is not the owner or that Mr. Wu is not the inventor\u2014only that they had not proven they are. The patent records continue to reflect Mr. Wu as the inventor and Mud as the owner.\n[106] Therefore, on what basis did the Federal Court dismiss the appellants\u2019 infringement action?\n[107] The Federal Court tells us: because they did not establish that Mud is the owner of the subject matter of the patents, notwithstanding that it is named owner in the patent record. This amounts to asking the appellants to prove an aspect of validity of the disputed patents in order to pursue an infringement claim. In my view, this is the reviewable error.\nF. What about the Federal Court\u2019s credibility findings? [108] I take no issue with my colleague\u2019s discussion of the Federal Court\u2019s credibility findings regarding Mr. Wu and Dr. Rivard. There is no dispute that this Court\u2019s role is not to reweigh the evidence. However, I find myself questioning the relevance of Dr. Rivard\u2019s evidence to dismissal of the infringement action.\n[109] Dr. Rivard was asked \u201cto provide his opinion on a series of issues related to the [patents in dispute and the respondents\u2019 patents], essentially to identify the invention of each patent, compare them to one another and examine if each of their invention [sic] overlap with one another\u201d and \u201cto describe the subject matter of the work of Mr. Wu at Marquis from 2001-2006 and how it relates to the invention of the Disputed Patents\u201d and \u201cto provide his opinion on when the invention of the [patents in dispute] crystallized, namely whether it was during Mr. Wu\u2019s employment with Marquis\u201d: reasons at paras. 85-86. Credible though he was, the Federal Court concluded Dr. Rivard\u2019s evidence did not establish the respondents\u2019 claims to ownership: reasons at paras. 138, 139, 144, 145. And that, in my view, was the determinative question on motion.\n[110] The Federal Court relied on Dr. Rivard\u2019s evidence in two respects. First, it concluded that his evidence rebutted the presumption that the named inventor, Mr. Wu, is the inventor and so that Mud is the owner: reasons at para. 89. That may be true, such that the ownership issue was put in play. But, in my view rebutting the presumption is not enough to dismiss the infringement action because, having rebutted it, the respondents failed to persuade the Federal Court that any one else was the inventor or owner. Critically, the Federal Court did not conclude Mr. Wu was not the inventor nor Mud not the owner. In my view, the appellants did not have to establish they were in order to pursue an infringement action. They remain inventor and owner of record in the patent office and subsection 43(2) of the Patent Act applies.\n[111] Second, the Federal Court contrasts Dr. Rivard\u2019s \u201c[opinion] that the similarities between [one of the respondents\u2019 patents], of which Mr. Wu is a co-inventor, and the Disputed Patents are striking\u201d with the appellants\u2019 failure to \u201cestablish that the Disputed Patents\u2019 drilling fluids are completely different from the ones Mr. Wu worked on while at Marquis\u201d: reasons at paras. 100\u2011101. For reasons I have explained, while possibly relevant to other claims of invalidity, I do not see this as relevant to the motion before the Federal Court.\n[112] Mr. Wu\u2019s evidence did not convince the Federal Court he was the inventor and so it was not prepared to give Mud the declaration it sought. However, in my view, the appellants were not obliged to prove Mr. Wu was the inventor to pursue their infringement action. Put another way, if the appellants led no evidence whatsoever, given the Federal Court\u2019s findings about the respondents\u2019 claim to ownership as described in paragraphs 83-85 above, on what basis could the Federal Court dismiss the infringement action?\nIV. Conclusion [113] I would dismiss the appeal of the Federal Court\u2019s decision in the companion appeal (motion to strike) and award costs of that appeal to the respondents in the agreed amount of $10,000.\n[114] In their notice of appeal, the appellants seek a dismissal of particular aspects of the counterclaim, replicating the relief sought on the motion for summary trial before the Federal Court. However, in paragraph 2 of its judgment, the Federal Court dismissed the counterclaim entirely. That aspect of the judgment has not been appealed and is not before us. In these circumstances, an order dismissing particular aspects of the counterclaim would be superfluous.\n[115] I would allow the appeal of the Federal Court\u2019s decision on the motion for summary trial. Like my colleague, I would not send the matter back to the Federal Court for the reasons he expresses. Rather, I would amend the Federal Court\u2019s order to read as follows:\nThe motion for summary trial is granted.\nSecure Drilling\u2019s counterclaim is dismissed.\nNeither Mud nor Secure Drilling is entitled to the declaration of ownership that they sought.\nCosts in the Federal Court are awarded to Mud and Mr. Wu.\n[116] I would also award the appellants costs of this appeal in the agreed amount of $15,000.\n\u201cK.A.

Overview [1] Agracity Crop & Nutrition Ltd. (Agracity) appeals from two decisions of the Federal Court. In the first (2022 FC 1422, per Justice Mandy Aylen, hereinafter the Liability Decision), the Federal Court ruled that various claims of Canadian Patent No. 2,346,021 (the 021 Patent) were not invalid for obviousness, anticipation, insufficiency or overbreadth, and were infringed by Agracity. The Liability Decision also ordered disgorgement of Agracity\u2019s profits. The second decision under appeal (2023 FC 163, per Justice Mandy Aylen, hereinafter the Costs Decision) awarded costs to the respondents.\n[2] Agracity limits its arguments on appeal to the issues of anticipation and obviousness of the 021 Patent. Agracity does not take issue before this Court with the Federal Court\u2019s findings concerning insufficiency, overbreadth and infringement. Agracity also does not take issue with the Costs Decision, except to argue that it should be set aside if its appeal on either of the issues raised in respect of the Liability Decision is successful.\n[3] For the reasons set out below, I would dismiss both appeals.\nII. The 021 Patent [4] The 021 Patent concerns a selective herbicide known as flucarbazone sodium. A herbicide is selective if it kills or reduces weeds with minimal injury to the surrounding crop. Different compounds may be more or less effective as selective herbicides depending on the crop and the targeted weeds.\n[5] The disclosure of the 021 Patent acknowledges that flucarbazone sodium was known at the time of filing as a herbicide, having been disclosed in prior publications including U.S. Patent No. 5,534,486 (the 486 Patent) and corresponding Canadian Patent No. 2,064,636 (the 636 Patent). However, the 021 Patent indicates that its properties as a selective herbicide were not known at that time, and were surprising.\n[6] The 021 Patent expired in 2019, but the respondents alleged that Agracity jumped the gun by entering the market with its own flucarbazone sodium herbicide product a few months prior to the patent\u2019s expiration. The Liability Decision concerns the allegations of infringement during this period.\nIII. Issues and Standard of Review [7] As indicated above, the only issues that remain in dispute concern whether the claims in question of the 021 Patent are invalid for either anticipation or obviousness.\n[8] The parties do not disagree on the applicable standard of review. The Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, directs that, on appeal, questions of law are reviewed on a standard of correctness, and questions of fact as well as of mixed fact and law, in which no question of law is extricable, are reviewed on a standard of palpable and overriding error. Accordingly, except on questions of law, this Court will not intervene in a decision of the Federal Court unless we find an error that is both palpable (obvious) and overriding (going to the very core of the outcome of the case).\n[9] Agracity acknowledges that, with one exception, the standard of review applicable to its arguments in this appeal is that of palpable and overriding error. The exception applies to its argument that the Federal Court made a legal error by misapplying part of the legal test for anticipation.\nIV. Anticipation [10] Agracity does not take issue with the summary of the law concerning patent invalidity for anticipation as set out in paragraphs 214 and following of the Liability Decision. Rather, as noted above, Agracity argues that the Federal Court failed to follow the legal test that it set out.\n[11] Paragraph 28.2(1)(a) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, provides that a patent claim is not valid if the subject matter defined thereby has been publicly disclosed before a certain date. The parties agree, and I concur, that the date for assessment of anticipation of the 021 Patent is September 21, 1998. There is no dispute that the 636 and 486 Patents (which were published on October 5, 1992 and July 9, 1996, respectively) are citable on the issue of anticipation. The issue concerns whether those patents disclose subject matter that meets the criteria for anticipation.\n[12] The Liability Decision correctly notes that there are two requirements for anticipation: disclosure and enablement: Apotex Inc. v. Sanofi-Synthelabo Canada Inc., 2008 SCC 61, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 265 (Sanofi-Synthelabo); Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research, 2020 FCA 30, [2020] F.C.J. No. 179 at para. 66 (Hospira). The Liability Decision also correctly cites Free World Trust v. \u00c9lectro Sant\u00e9 Inc., 2000 SCC 66, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1024 at paras. 25-26 (Free World Trust), to the effect that anticipation by publication is a difficult defence to establish. One must, in effect, be able to look at a prior, single publication and find in it all the information that, for practical purposes, is needed to produce the claimed invention without the exercise of any inventive skill. The prior publication must contain so clear a direction that a skilled person reading and following it would in every case and without possibility of error be led to the claimed invention. A signpost, however clear, upon the road to the patentee's invention will not suffice. The prior inventor must be clearly shown to have planted their flag at the precise destination before the patentee. As indicated in Free World Trust at paragraph 26, another characterization of the question is whether the information given in the prior publication is, for the purpose of practical utility, equal to that given in the patent in suit.\n[13] To meet the disclosure requirement, the prior publication must disclose subject matter which, if performed, would necessarily result in infringement of the patent whose validity is in issue: Sanofi-Synthelabo at para. 25. However, it is not enough for a prior publication to merely \u201cinclude\u201d or \u201cencompass\u201d the claimed invention \u2013 a broad disclosure will not necessarily anticipate a later, more specific claim: Apotex Inc. v. Shire LLC, 2021 FCA 52, [2021] 3 F.C.R. 46 at para. 45 (Shire).\n[14] Agracity attempts to distinguish Shire on the basis that Shire involved a selection patent (in which the invention lies in the selection of one or more species from a broader known genus), whereas the parties have agreed that the 021 Patent is not a selection patent. I see no reason to distinguish the guidance in Shire on that basis. Paragraphs 31 and 32 thereof state that (i) there is no magic in the term \u201cselection patent\u201d, and (ii) the requirements for anticipation and obviousness are the same whether or not the patent in question is a selection patent.\n[15] To meet the enablement requirement, the disclosure in the prior publication must have been sufficient that a person skilled in the art would have been able to perform the claimed invention without the exercise of any inventive ingenuity or undue experimentation: Sanofi-Synthelabo at para. 33.\n[16] Agracity takes issue with the statement in the 021 Patent that the properties of flucarbazone sodium as a selective herbicide were not known at the time of filing. Agracity cites an extract from column 28 of the 486 Patent (also appearing at pages 43 to 45 of the 636 Patent), which was reproduced at paragraph 32 of the Liability Decision, that states that the substances contemplated therein \u201cact as total or selective herbicides depend[ing] essentially on the amount used.\u201d The same extract later states that some of the compounds of the formula (I) (which encompasses flucarbazone sodium) are suitable for the selective control of certain weeds in certain crops. It also identifies Avena (also called wild oats) as a potential target weed. Agracity also notes, as acknowledged at paragraph 38 of the Liability Decision, that flucarbazone sodium is specifically defined in claim 10 of the 486 Patent.\n[17] Agracity argues that the properties described in the 021 Patent of flucarbazone sodium as a selective herbicide were already known. It also notes that Avena is specifically identified as a target weed in several claims of the 021 Patent. Agracity argues that the 486 and 636 Patents meet the disclosure requirement for anticipation because doing what is described therein would necessarily result in infringement of the 021 Patent.\n[18] I do not agree. Though flucarbazone sodium is among the many herbicides contemplated in the 486 and 636 Patents, and though these patents state that some of said herbicides are selective against certain weeds in certain cultures depending essentially on the amount used, this is not sufficient to meet the high bar of the disclosure requirement for anticipation. For one thing, the 486 and 636 Patents do not indicate that flucarbazone sodium is among the herbicides with selective properties. Further, the Federal Court found at paragraph 169 of the Liability Decision that the selective properties of herbicides contemplated in the 021 Patent are due to their chemical structure, rather than the amount used as contemplated in the 486 and 636 Patents. Finally, most of the claims in issue in the 021 Patent are specific as to the crop that is to be treated (cereal or wheat), while the 486 and 636 Patents do not disclose the use of herbicides in such crops.\n[19] I see no reviewable error in the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that a skilled person reading and following the 486 and 636 Patents would not, in every case and without possibility of error, be led to the invention claimed in the 021 Patent. Likewise, I disagree with Agracity\u2019s argument that doing what is described in the 486 and 636 Patents would necessarily result in infringement of the 021 Patent.\n[20] I also disagree with Agracity\u2019s argument that, at paragraph 224 of the Liability Decision, the Federal Court conflated the test for obviousness with that for anticipation. Actually, the Federal Court simply noted there, as was open to it, that its findings in relation to obviousness were fatal to the anticipation argument: that the 486 and 636 Patents \u201cdid not disclose all of the information that would, for practical purposes, be needed to produce the claimed invention of the 021 Patent without the exercise of inventive skill.\u201d Though that threshold is indeed relevant to an obviousness analysis, it is also relevant to the enablement requirement in an anticipation analysis, as indicated in paragraph 15 above.\n[21] Agracity argues that the next sentence in paragraph 224 applies to obviousness only, and not to anticipation: \u201cThe Skilled Person would not know why to select flucarbazone sodium from among the 327 compounds, for which crop and for which weed\u201d (emphasis added). However, I understand this statement as proper support for the conclusion in the next sentence thereafter that the prior art does not provide \u201cclear and unmistakeable directions\u201d such that a skilled person would \u201cin every case and without possibility of error be led to the claimed invention.\u201d\n[22] Because of my conclusion on the disclosure requirement, it is not necessary for me to discuss the Federal Court\u2019s analysis of the enablement requirement. I conclude that the Federal Court made no reviewable error in its anticipation analysis.\nV. Obviousness [23] As with anticipation, Agracity acknowledges that the Federal Court\u2019s summary of the legal principles applicable to obviousness was correct.\n[24] A first argument by Agracity against the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that the 021 Patent was not invalid for obviousness is that the Federal Court\u2019s analysis improperly considered the inventive concept of the patent as a whole, and failed to consider the claims thereof individually.\n[25] This argument is not supported on a fair reading of the Liability Decision. At paragraphs 127 and following, the Federal Court construed each of the claims in issue separately. The Federal Court also clearly understood that obviousness analysis was to be done claim by claim. When summarizing the proper legal test at paragraph 144, the Federal Court noted that one step was to identify \u201cthe inventive concept of the claim in question or if that cannot readily be done, construe it\u201d (emphasis added). The Federal Court repeated this understanding of the legal test at paragraph 149. Moreover, at the end of that paragraph, the Federal Court stated explicitly that \u201c[i]t is the inventive concept(s) of the claim(s) in issue that must be the focus of an obviousness inquiry, not the inventive concept of the patent\u201d. This understanding of the proper determination of the inventive concept is confirmed at paragraph 175, which discusses the difference between the state of the art and the inventive concept on a claim by claim basis.\n[26] The Federal Court may simply not have felt the need to go into detail concerning the inventive concept because, as it stated at paragraph 156 of the Liability Decision, \u201c[t]here is no dispute between the parties that the inventive concept of the Asserted Claims of the 021 Patent accords with the language of the claims themselves.\u201d\n[27] On this issue, it may be helpful to note this Court\u2019s words in Shire at paragraph 86:\nAlthough a claim by claim analysis of each claim\u2019s inventive concept is to be conducted, it is important to remember that a single, overarching inventive concept connects every claim of a patent, with its genesis usually in the independent claim(s). As seen in AstraZeneca Canada Inc. [v. Apotex Inc., 2017 SCC 36, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 943], the \u201csubject matter\u201d of an invention can be multi-faceted (at para. 49). There, Rowe J., quoting David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law 2nd ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2011), at 275, noted:\nFor simplicity's sake, the rule is \u201cone invention, one application, one patent.\u201d But inventions are like a many-faceted prism: multiple claims (sometimes running into the hundreds) covering all facets are allowed in the same patent if a \u201csingle general inventive concept\u201d links them.\n[28] Agracity also argues that the Federal Court improperly imported requirements for anticipation into its obviousness analysis at paragraph 164 of the Liability Decision. I disagree. It was open to the Federal Court to find that, though flucarbazone sodium was known as a herbicide, this knowledge was not such that a skilled person would be led directly and without difficulty to use it is as a selective herbicide as defined in the claims in issue. These claims concern (i) selectivity based on chemical structure rather than amount used, and (ii) selectivity against certain defined weeds in certain defined crops. The fact that the Federal Court cited similar factual findings in its analysis on anticipation and on obviousness does not mean, as Agracity argues, that the Federal Court comingled those concepts.\n[29] Agracity\u2019s other arguments on obviousness take issue with conclusions by the Federal Court that are factually suffused, but do not establish a palpable and overriding error by the Federal Court, in my view. Nor do I see an error here on an extricable question of law. I conclude that the Federal Court made no reviewable error in its obviousness analysis.\nVI. Conclusion [30] It follows from the foregoing that I would dismiss the appeal of the Liability Decision. Because Agracity\u2019s appeal of the Costs Decision is based exclusively on alleged errors in the Liability Decision, I would likewise dismiss the appeal of the Costs Decision.

Overview [1] President\u2019s Choice Bank (PC Bank) offers financial services. Together with related corporations, PC Bank also participates in a loyalty program whose main purpose is to drive retail traffic to the Loblaws stores. The program involves PC Bank issuing credit card points, which cardholders obtain whenever they use their cards. Cardholders can only use these points at Loblaws stores to get discounts on their purchases. PC Bank reimburses Loblaws for the discount that customers receive when they redeem their points at Loblaws stores (Redemption Payment).\n[2] The issue in this appeal is whether PC Bank can claim notional input tax credits (NITCs) for the Redemption Payment. The Minister of National Revenue concedes that the Redemption Payment fulfills all but one of the criteria for NITCs: that the payment be made \u201cin the course of a commercial activity\u201d. The Tax Court held in favour of the Minister (2022 TCC 84), concluding that the Redemption Payment is made in the course of a financial services activity. PC Bank appeals.\n[3] For the following reasons, I would allow the appeal. The Redemption Payment meets the criteria for NITCs under subsection 181(5) of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15 (Act). Unless otherwise indicated, all legislative references are to the Act.\nII. Background A. Legislative Background [4] Part IX of the Act imposes a tax on most supplies of goods and services (GST): subsections 123(1) definition of \u201ctaxable supply\u201d, 165(1). The GST is a tax on consumption: it is paid by the end consumer. It is also a value-added tax because each business in the supply chain pays GST on the value it adds to the property or service. The mechanism for ensuring the GST operates in this way is the input tax credit (ITC): City of Calgary v. Canada, 2012 SCC 20 at para. 16; Bank of Montreal v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FC 1014 at para. 10.\n[5] This mechanism is illustrated by the following example, which assumes a 15% combined federal provincial rate of GST and Harmonised Sales Tax (HST). A supplier sells a bottle of shampoo to a retailer for $6.00, and the retailer pays $0.90 GST\/HST. The retailer then sells the shampoo for $10.00 to a customer in Canada, adding $4.00 of value and charging $1.50 GST\/HST to the customer. To the extent that the retailer supplies the shampoo in the course of its commercial activities, it is entitled to an ITC of $0.90, corresponding to the GST\/HST it paid the supplier: subsection 169(1). Thus, the retailer only remits $0.60 GST\/HST to the government, corresponding to the tax on the $4.00 value it added to the shampoo.\n[6] When the retailer accepts that the customer pays a portion of the $10.00 price for the shampoo using a $1.00 coupon or $1.00 of redeemable points (equivalent to a coupon for purposes of the Act), and expects that a particular person will reimburse it (the retailer) the $1.00, the rules in section 181 apply.\n[7] Paragraphs 181(2)(a) and (b) deem the tax collectible and collected by the retailer to be the tax that would have been collected without the coupon. In the example above, and as explained at paragraph 17 of the Tax Court\u2019s reasons, the retailer is deemed to have collected and must remit $1.50:\nPrice of the shampoo\n$10.00\nGST\/HST at 15%\n$1.50\nSubtotal\n$11.50\nLess coupon\n($1.00)\nCustomer pays\n$10.50\n[8] Paragraphs 181(2)(a) and (b) create an overpayment of tax: the government collects $1.50, whereas normally, a $9.00 purchase would yield $1.35 of GST\/HST.\n[9] Paragraph 181(2)(c) and subsection 181(5) relieve this overpayment.\n[10] First, paragraph 181(2)(c) deems the tax payable by the recipient (the purchaser of the goods\/services) to be the tax collectible less the tax fraction of the coupon value. Subsection 181(1) defines the tax fraction of the coupon value as the fraction A\/B where:\nA is the total rate set out in subsection 165(1) (5%) and the tax rate for that participating province (10% in this example) (5% + 10% = 15%), and\nB is the total of 100% and the amount determined for A (100% + 15% = 115%).\nThus, the tax fraction of the $1.00 coupon in the example above is 15\/115 = 0.13 (13%), and the tax deemed payable by the recipient is $1.37, that is, $1.50 minus $0.13.\n[11] Second, subsection 181(5) relieves the overpayment of tax \u201c[b]y allowing the [person redeeming the coupon] an input tax credit [and ensuring] that the correct overall net amount of tax is remitted to the government in respect of the supply by the vendor\u201d: Canada, Department of Finance, Draft Legislation to Amend the Excise Tax Act (GST) and Related Statutes, Explanatory Notes (September 1992) at 106 [1992 Explanatory Notes]. Paragraph 181(5)(c) achieves this result by granting the person redeeming the coupon an NITC equal to the tax fraction of the coupon value. In the example discussed above, the person paying for the $1.00 of points would be entitled to claim an NITC of $0.13.\n[12] Crucial to this appeal is the fact that subsection 181(5) only applies where the person redeeming the coupon does so in the course of its commercial activity: Canada, Department of Finance, Technical Notes re s. 181(5), (February 1993). More precisely, subsection 181(5) provides that a particular person may claim an ITC when it \u201cpays, in the course of a commercial activity of the particular person, an amount to the supplier for the redemption of the coupon.\u201d\nB. Factual Background [13] The Tax Court\u2019s reasons set out the facts in some detail. The following summary is sufficient for the purposes of this appeal.\n[14] PC Bank, Loblaws Inc. (Loblaws), and President\u2019s Choice Services Inc. (PCSI) are directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries of Loblaw Companies Limited.\n[15] PC Bank is a financial institution for the purposes of the Act. It is also registered for the purposes of Part IX of the Act.\n[16] PC Bank issues President\u2019s Choice branded MasterCard credit cards (PC MasterCards) to its customers (cardholders). Cardholders can use their PC MasterCard to make purchases at stores that accept PC MasterCards and obtain credit card points (PCB Points). Every time a PC MasterCard is used, PC Bank receives interchange fees.\n[17] PC Bank is also a party to three agreements, rectified by order of the Ontario Superior Court: (1) a Licence Agreement with PCSI, (2) a Loyalty Services Agreement, also with PCSI, and (3) a Loyalty Expense Agreement with PCSI and Loblaws. These agreements form the Loyalty Program. For the Loblaws corporate group, a key purpose of the Loyalty Program is to drive retail traffic to Loblaws, whose revenue far exceeds PC Bank\u2019s MasterCard revenue.\n[18] Pursuant to the Loyalty Program,\na) PC Bank has a royalty-free license to issue PCB Points to its PC MasterCard cardholders. PC Bank issues PCB Points to cardholders whenever they use their PC MasterCard. However, cardholders earn more PCB Points for purchases made at a Loblaws store, and they can only use their points at stores owned or controlled by Loblaws;\nb) Loblaws pays to PC Bank:\n0.75\u00a2 for every $1.00 of purchases cardholders make at Loblaws stores using their PC MasterCard where PC Bank issues PCB Points to the cardholder; and\n$0.35 for every $1.00 of PCB Points cardholders use at Loblaws stores; and\nc) PC Bank reimburses\/pays Loblaws $1.00 for every $1.00 worth of PCB Points cardholders use at Loblaws stores (the Redemption Payment).\n[19] As mentioned, the parties agree on all but one of the criteria for NITCs. Their disagreement turns on whether PC Bank makes the Redemption Payment \u201cin the course of a commercial activity\u201d.\nIII. Tax Court Decision [20] The Tax Court stated that it needed to determine whether the \u201cRedemption Payment [is] linked to the making of exempt or taxable supplies by PC Bank\u201d: TCC Reasons at para. 66. The Tax Court concluded that PC Bank makes the Redemption Payment \u201cin the course of [its] MasterCard activity, which involves the provision of exempt supplies of financial services to [c]ardholders\u201d: TCC Reasons at paras. 65, 67, 75. The Tax Court reached this conclusion because:\na)PC Bank\u2019s core business is the provision of financial services to its customers: TCC Reasons at paras. 70\u201371;\nb)PC Bank\u2019s revenue earned from Loblaws pales in comparison to the substantial revenue it earns from interchange fees: TCC Reasons at paras. 67, 73;\nc)It is inconceivable and irreconcilable with normal commercial and business practices that PC Bank would accept to make a Redemption Payment of $1.00 to earn $0.35 and lose money: TCC Reasons at paras. 67, 73, 77; and\nd)PC Bank makes the Redemption Payment for the PCB Points as consideration for having issued the PCB Points: TCC Reasons at para. 82.\nIV. Issue and Standard of Review [21] In their memoranda of fact and law, both parties acknowledge that the issue relates to the phrase \u201cin the course of a commercial activity\u201d in subsection 181(5). The appellant says the issue is whether the Tax Court made an error of law in interpreting that phrase. The respondent says the issue is whether the Tax Court made a palpable and overriding error in concluding that PC Bank does not make the Redemption Payment \u201cin the course of a commercial activity.\u201d\n[22] Ultimately, the appellate standard of review applies: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 at paras. 8, 37. Questions of law are subject to correctness review, and questions of fact are only reviewable for palpable and overriding error. Findings of mixed fact and law are reviewable for palpable and overriding error unless they contain an extricable error of law. Extricable errors of law are reviewable on a correctness standard.\n[23] The issue of whether PC Bank makes the Redemption Payment in the course of its commercial activity is a question of mixed fact and law. Thus, correctness review applies insofar as the Tax Court committed any extricable error of law in deciding this issue.\nV. Analysis [24] In my opinion, the Tax Court committed two extricable errors of law. First, it considered that the phrase \u201cin the course of a commercial activity\u201d entails an either\/or test. Second, it considered profitability in determining the existence of a commercial activity. If one extricates these two legal errors, one finds that the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings lead to the conclusion that PC Bank makes the Redemption Payment in the course of its commercial activity of driving customers to Loblaws. The following analysis demonstrates the Tax Court\u2019s legal errors, then illustrates how extricating those errors impact this case\u2019s outcome.\nA. There Is No Either\/Or Test [25] The Tax Court based its analysis on the premise that it needed to determine whether PC Bank makes the Redemption Payment in the course of a financial services activity or in the course of a commercial activity. The Tax Court adopted this premise in saying that it needed to examine the evidence to determine whether the \u201cRedemption Payment [is] linked to the making of exempt or taxable supplies\u201d: TCC Reasons at para. 66 [emphasis added]. Yet analyzing the text, context, and purpose of subsection 181(5) reveals that it is not an either\/or test: it allows a person to pay an amount in the course of a commercial activity and in the course of an activity that is not commercial.\n(1) Text [26] Subsection 181(5) provides that a particular person may claim an ITC when it \u201cpays, in the course of a commercial activity of the particular person, an amount to the supplier for the redemption of the coupon.\u201d The text of subsection 181(5) does not require that the amount be paid \u201cexclusively\u201d in the course of a commercial activity, nor does it require that the amount be paid \u201cprimarily\u201d in the course of such an activity. Unlike the words exclusively and primarily, the phrase \u201cin the course of\u201d has a broad meaning; it means \u201cincidental to\u201d or \u201cconnected to\u201d directly or indirectly: Attorney General of Canada v. Metropolitan Toronto Hockey League, [1995] F.C.J. No. 944 at para. 14, n 1; The Queen v. Blanchard, 1995 CanLII 18940 (FCA); M.N.R. v. Yonge Eglinton Building Ltd., 1974 CanLII 2476 (FCA), [1974] 1 F.C. 637 at 644\u2013645.\n[27] Reading subsection 181(5) as stating that a person can only pay an amount in the course of one activity would add words to the Act. Similarly, it would add words to the Act to read subsection 181(5) as requiring that an amount have a primary connection with a commercial activity.\n(2) Context [28] The context of subsection 181(5) supports the above textual interpretation.\n(a) A payment can be made in the course of more than one activity [29] Subsections 169(1), 141(2) and (4), 202(2), as well as paragraphs 199(2)(a), 217.1(6)(c), and 217.1(7)(c) show that the Act contemplates that a payment can be made in the course of doing one thing and in the course of doing another. More specifically, the Act contemplates that a payment can be made in the course of a commercial activity and in the course of an activity that is not commercial.\n(i) Subsection 169(1) [30] Subsection 169(1) provides the general rule for ITCs. It contains a formula, which grants an ITC for tax paid in respect of a property or service to the extent that the registrant acquires the property or service for use in the course of its commercial activities. This formula results in the registrant being entitled to an ITC according to the percentage of use of the property or service in the course of commercial activities. The inclusion of the formula presupposes that a property or service can be acquired for use in the course of more than one activity. This was the case in Midland Hutterian Brethren v. Canada, 2000 CanLII 16725 (FCA) [Midland] where a colony purchased cloth for its members. The members could use the cloth to make two types of clothing: working clothes for the colony\u2019s commercial activity (farming) and clothes for their personal activities. Our Court rejected the Minister\u2019s argument that any personal use of clothing disqualified the work cloth from any ITC, and concluded that the colony was entitled to an ITC pursuant to the formula in subsection 169(1).\n[31] Midland does not address whether the colony paid for the cloth in the course its commercial activity or in the course of its non-commercial activity of providing cloth to its members for personal use. Nevertheless, from the moment that the cloth was acquired for use in the course of more than one activity, it stands to reason that the colony paid for the cloth in the course of two activities.\n(ii) Subsections 141(2) and (4) [32] Subsection 141(2) provides that, where \u201csubstantially all\u201d the consumption or use for which a person acquires a property or service is in the course of the person\u2019s commercial activities, all of the use or consumption is deemed to be in the course of those commercial activities. Similarly, subsection 141(4) provides that, where substantially all the consumption or use for which a person acquires a property or service is in the course of activities that are not commercial, all of the use or consumption is deemed to be in the course of those non-commercial activities. This wording demonstrates that Parliament considers that an acquisition can be made substantially\u2014but not totally\u2014in the course of one activity and, to a smaller extent, in the course of another activity. Again, this entails that the payment for the property or service is made in the course of more than one activity.\n(iii) Subsection 202(2) [33] Subsection 202(2) provides that a registrant is not entitled to an ITC in respect of a vehicle or aircraft unless the vehicle or aircraft \u201cwas acquired [\u2026] for use exclusively in commercial activities of the registrant\u201d [emphasis added]. The fact that Parliament requires that the vehicle or aircraft be acquired for exclusive use in commercial activities presupposes that a vehicle or aircraft can be acquired\u2014and hence the payment made for that vehicle or aircraft\u2014in the course of both commercial and non-commercial activities.\n(iv) Paragraph 199(2)(a) [34] Similarly, paragraph 199(2)(a) provides that a registrant is not entitled to an ITC in respect of capital property \u201cunless the property was acquired (\u2026) for use primarily in commercial activities of the registrant\u201d [emphasis added]. Again, the requirement that the capital property be acquired for use primarily in commercial activities presupposes that the property can be acquired, and its payment made, in the course of more than one activity.\n(v) Paragraphs 217.1(6)(c) and 217.1(7)(c) [35] Paragraphs 217.1(6)(c) and 217.1(7)(c) provide rules for computing ITCs and rebates that financial institutions can claim in the context of the Division IV Tax on Imported Taxable Supplies. These paragraphs call for a determination of the extent to which an outlay or expense was made or incurred \u201cin the course of commercial activities\u201d of the financial institutions. If one talks about the \u201cextent to which\u201d an expense is incurred in the course of a commercial activity, then there must be an extent to which the expense was incurred in the course of a non-commercial activity. Therefore, Parliament presupposes that the payment of a single expense can be simultaneously in the course of a commercial activity and in the course of a non-commercial activity. This reinforces the interpretation that Parliament, in drafting subsection 181(5), presupposed that the payment redeeming a coupon could be simultaneously in the course of a commercial activity and in the course of a non-commercial activity.\n[36] In drafting subsection 181(5), Parliament did not include explicit language that the credit be allocated only \u201cto the extent\u201d that the person made the payment in the course of a commercial activity. The absence of this allocative language indicates that Parliament intended to grant an NITC on the entire amount of a coupon redemption payment from the moment the payment was made in the course of a commercial activity.\n(vi) The specific context of subsection 181(5) [37] Many of the provisions discussed above refer to tax paid in the context of an acquisition of property or service. This makes sense because an acquisition of property or service, or an equivalent transaction (e.g. importation), is ordinarily the triggering event for GST to become payable. In the case of a coupon, the particular person who pays for the coupon or makes the redemption payment does not acquire a property or service\u2014the customer does. In the example discussed above, the customer acquires the shampoo, and the particular person pays for the coupon. Accordingly, subsection 181(5) could not use the same language as that used in ss. 169(1), 141(2) and (4), 202(2), 199(2)(a), 217.1(6)(c), and 217.1(7)(c). That said, from the moment that the Act contemplates that a payment for property or service can be made in the course of more than one activity, there is no reason why a redemption payment cannot be made in the course of more than one activity.\n(b) There is no requirement for a special connection between the payment for the redemption of the coupon and the commercial activity [38] Subsections 169(1), 202(2) as well paragraphs 199(2)(a), 217.1(6)(c), and 217.1(7)(c) also show that when Parliament wants a property or service acquired to have a special connection with a commercial activity, its states so expressly.\n[39] For example, ss. 169(1), 217.1(6)(c), and 217.1(7)(c) provide that an ITC will only be allowed to \u201cthe extent\u201d that the property or service is acquired or the outlay or expense is made or incurred for use in the course of commercial activities. Subsection 202(2) requires that a vehicle or aircraft be acquired for \u201cuse exclusively in the course of commercial activities of the registrant\u201d. As for paragraph 199(2)(a), it requires that a capital property be acquired for \u201cuse primarily in the commercial activities of the registrant\u201d. The absence of a similar constraint in subsection 181(5) indicates that Parliament did not intend to require a higher degree of connection between the amount paid for the redemption of the coupon and the registrant\u2019s commercial activity.\n(c) The Act\u2019s structure indicates that one cannot extrapolate subsection 169(1)\u2019s apportionment methodology to subsection 181(5) [40] It may be tempting to interpret subsection 181(5) in light of the general rule for ITCs in subsection 169(1), which provides a formula that only awards ITCs to the extent that a good or service was used in the course of a commercial activity. More specifically, one may be tempted to infer from subsection 169(1)\u2019s apportionment methodology that Parliament did not contemplate that the whole redemption payment in subsection 181(5) could be made in the course of a commercial activity and in the course of a financial services activity. Yet the structure of the Act suggests that one cannot extrapolate subsection 169(1)\u2019s apportionment methodology to subsection 181(5).\n[41] Subsection 169(1) is in Subdivision B of Division II of Part IX. Subdivision B is entitled \u201cIncome Tax Credits\u201d and contains general rules about ITCs. Subdivision C, which contains section 181, is entitled \u201cSpecial Cases\u201d. Subdivision C comprises a plethora of rules to address \u201cspecial\u201d cases where applying the general rules in Subdivision B would lead to incongruous results undesirable to Parliament: CWAY Logistics Ltd. v. The Queen, 2017 TCC 225 at para. 24. This structural distinction suggests that Parliament intended to give separate or \u201cspecial\u201d treatment to input tax credits for the redemption of coupons. Consequently, one should be wary of extrapolating subsection 169(1)\u2019s apportionment methodology to subsection 181(5) and concluding that a redemption payment can only be made in the course of either a commercial activity or in the course of a non-commercial activity.\n(3) Purpose [42] The purpose of subsection 181(5) is to ensure that the \u201ccorrect overall net amount of [tax] is remitted to the government in respect of the supply to the vendor\u201d: 1992 Explanatory Notes at 106 [emphasis added].\n[43] In the example of the bottle of shampoo discussed above, the retailer is deemed to have collected, and must report and remit GST\/HST of $1.50\u2014that is, 15% of $10.00 (price of the shampoo before applying the coupon). Yet the customer did not pay the full price of the shampoo; it only paid $9.00. If the person redeeming the coupon paid the other portion of the price of the shampoo\u2014the remaining $1.00\u2014in the course of a commercial activity, then that person is entitled to claim an NITC equal to the tax fraction of the portion it paid. Without the NITC, the government would over-collect tax.\n[44] There is an overpayment, and the purpose of subsection 181(5) is to relieve that overpayment. This purpose concords with Parliament\u2019s choice of a broad phrase like \u201cin the course of\u201d, which merely requires a payment to be \u201cconnected to\u201d or \u201cincidental to\u201d a commercial activity. Insofar as imposing an either\/or test would restrict NITCs for payments connected to commercial activities, such an imposition would contravene Parliament\u2019s purpose.\n[45] Additionally, the fact that the person redeeming the coupon is a financial institution is of no consequence if its redemption payment is in the course of a commercial activity. When Parliament intends to exclude financial institution from claiming an ITC, it does so expressly: see ss. 141, 199(1), 200(1). Subsection 181(5) contains no such exclusion.\n(4) Conclusion: First extricable error of law [46] The above textual, contextual, and purposive analysis reveals that subsection 181(5) is not an either\/or test: a payment can be made in the course of a commercial activity and in the course of a non-commercial activity. Subsection 181(5) does not require a court to determine in the course of which of two activities an amount for the redemption of a coupon is paid. Moreover, subsection 181(5) does not require that the amount paid have a \u201cprimary\u201d or \u201cexclusive\u201d connection with a commercial activity. Accordingly, the Tax Court erred in law by basing its analysis on the premise that it needed to determine whether the Redemption Payment is made in the course of a financial services activity or in the course of a commercial activity.\n[47] In fairness to the Tax Court, the case was seemingly presented to it as an either\/or test: \u201cAppellant\u2019s written submissions to the Tax Court in respect of the NITC Issue\u201d, Supplemental Appeal Book, Vol. 8, Tab 16, at 2529 at para. 90; see also \u201cTranscript of Opening Statements, dated January 31, 2022\u201d, Supplemental Appeal Book, Vol. 8, Tab 14 at 2480\u201381. However, given that 1) this new argument relates to an issue of statutory interpretation, 2) the appellant\u2019s new argument does not prejudice the respondent who had the opportunity to adduce evidence that could defeat this argument, and 3) the respondent does not take issue with this new argument being raised, I am of the view that the interests of justice require that this new argument be considered: Koch v. Borgatti Estate, 2022 FCA 201 at para. 67; Quan v. Cusson, 2009 SCC 62 at paras. 36\u201337; Eli Lilly Canada Inc. v. Teva Canada Limited, 2018 FCA 53 at para. 45, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 38077 (8 November 2018). This is why I proceeded with a statutory analysis of subsection 181(5).\n[48] I will now examine the Tax Court\u2019s second error of law.\nB. The Existence of a Commercial Activity Does Not Depend on Profitability [49] The Tax Court said that PC Bank did not establish the nature of the alleged commercial activity for which it claims NITCs: TCC Reasons at paras. 72\u201377. PC Bank alleged that the commercial activity was driving customer traffic to Loblaws in connection with its participation in the Loyalty Program: TCC Reasons at para. 72; \u201cAppellant\u2019s written submissions to the Tax Court in respect of the NITC Issue\u201d, Supplemental Appeal Book, Vol. 8, Tab 16, 2505, 2508\u201310, 2529 at paras. 2, 15\u201321, 32, 89. The Tax Court refused to find that this constituted a commercial activity: it found such a proposition irreconcilable with \u201cnormal commercial and business practices\u201d because it was \u201cunimaginable\u201d that \u201cthe [a]ppellant would accept to pay $1.00 to earn $0.35\u201d: TCC Reasons at para. 77. By contrast, PC Bank\u2019s credit card business is profitable: TCC Reasons at paras. 73\u201376. At first glance, the Tax Court\u2019s reasoning appears satisfactory. But on closer inspection, it contains an extricable error of law. In sales tax, unlike in income tax, profitability is extraneous to determining whether a corporation has a commercial activity. Relying on factors extraneous to a legal test is an error of law: Smith v. Canada, 2019 FCA 173 at para. 30.\n[50] The definitions of \u201cbusiness\u201d and \u201ccommercial activity\u201d in subsection 123(1) make clear that a corporation\u2019s activity need not be profitable to qualify as a \u201ccommercial activity\u201d:\nbusiness includes [\u2026] [an] undertaking of any kind whatever, whether the activity or undertaking is engaged in for profit [\u2026]\ncommercial activity of a person means [\u2026] a business carried on by the person (other than a business carried on without a reasonable expectation of profit by an individual, a personal trust or a partnership, all of the members of which are individuals) except to the extent to which the adventure or concern involves the making of exempt supplies by the person [\u2026]\n[51] In the definition of commercial activity in subsection 123(1), corporations are conspicuously absent from the list of entities that must have a reasonable expectation of profit. The Canada Revenue Agency and the Tax Court have acknowledged that, in sales tax, for corporations, a commercial activity does not require a reasonable expectation of profit: Traitement de d\u00e9chets JRG Inc. v. The Queen, 2009 TCC 67 at para. 82; Canada Revenue Agency, Policy Statement P-176R, \u201cApplication of Profit Test to Carrying on a Business\u201d (30 September 1998).\n[52] Thus, the Tax Court erred in law by finding that PC Bank\u2019s participation in the Loyalty Program could not be a commercial activity simply because that participation did not provide PC Bank any reasonable expectation of profit.\nC. PC Bank Makes the Redemption Payment in the Course of a Commercial Activity [53] If one extricates the two legal errors identified above, one finds that the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings lead to the conclusion that PC Bank makes the Redemption Payment in the course of a commercial activity of driving customers to Loblaws.\n[54] The Act\u2019s definition of \u201cbusiness\u201d, reproduced in paragraph [50], refers to an \u201cundertaking of any kind whatever, whether the activity or undertaking is engaged in for profit\u201d.\n[55] No one disputes that PC Bank\u2019s activity of providing financial services is a business.\n[56] The Tax Court\u2019s factual findings concerning the agreements that form the Loyalty Program reveal that PC Bank has another business. By virtue of being a party to the agreements that form the Loyalty Program, PC Bank participates in a program that aims to drive retail traffic to Loblaws: TCC Reasons at paras. 7 (citing paragraphs 7\u201318 of the partial agreed statement of facts), 78\u201380, 84. The Licence Agreement grants PC Bank a licence to issue PCB Points to its cardholders: TCC Reasons at para. 43. The Licence Agreement also says that PC Bank \u201cacknowledges that by virtue of being a Licensee, it will be liable for the [Redemption Payment]\u201d: TCC Reasons at para. 7, citing paragraph 16b of the partial agreed statement of facts. The Tax Court found that PC Bank earns revenue from participating in the Loyalty Program: TCC Reasons at para. 67. It earns 0.75\u00a2 for PCB Points it issues when cardholders make $1.00 of purchases at Loblaws, and $0.35 for every $1.00 of PCB Points cardholders use at Loblaws stores: TCC Reasons at para. 7, citing paragraphs 18a\u2013b of the partial agreed statement of facts. In this context, I can only conclude that by virtue of being party to the agreements that form the Loyalty Program, PC Bank has a business of participating in driving customers to Loblaws (the driving customers business).\n[57] This conclusion is further supported by the Tax Court\u2019s comparison of the revenue PC Bank earns from its financial activities with the revenue it earns from the Loyalty Program. This comparison indicates the Tax Court\u2019s recognition PC Bank has two businesses.\n[58] There is no denying that PC Bank makes the Redemption Payment in the course of its financial services activity.\n[59] That said, and as discussed above, subsection 181(5) does not require that redemption payments be made \u201cexclusively\u201d or \u201cprimarily\u201d in the course of a commercial activity. PC Bank also makes the Redemption Payment in the course of its commercial activity\u2014namely, its business of driving customers to Loblaws. Indeed, the Loyalty Expense Agreement provides that PC Bank must make the Redemption Payment to Loblaws for every $1.00 worth of PCB Points cardholders use. It follows that, when PC Bank makes the Redemption Payment, it does so pursuant to its driving customers business, and consequently, in the course of a commercial activity as required by subsection 181(5). To that effect, our Court has previously held that promotional or marketing services that drive more customers to a business constitute a taxable supply\u2014i.e., services that drive increased customers to a business are in the course of a commercial activity: Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Canada, 2021 FCA 96 at paras. 15, 30, 67.\n[60] Because PC Bank makes the Redemption Payment in the course of its commercial activity, it is entitled to claim NITCs. This outcome is concordant with Parliament\u2019s purpose of correcting over-collection of tax where redemption payments are made in the course of a commercial activity.\nVI. Conclusion [61] In light of the above, I would allow the appeal with costs in this Court and the Court below, and set aside the judgment of the Tax Court. Rendering the judgment that the Tax Court should have rendered, I would allow PC Bank\u2019s appeal from the notices of reassessment dated March 26, 2014 (for the annual reporting period commencing December 31, 2008 and ending December 30, 2009) and June 23, 2015 (for the annual reporting periods ending December 30, 2010, December 30, 2011 and December 30, 2012) and refer the reassessments back to the Minister for reassessment on the basis that PC Bank is entitled to claim the notional input tax credits in respect of the Redemption Payment that it makes.\n\u201cNathalie Goyette\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nJ.B. Laskin J.A.\u201d\nWEBB J.A. (Dissenting Reasons)\n[62] The issue in this appeal is whether President\u2019s Choice Bank (PC Bank) was entitled to the notional input tax credit (NITC) as provided in subsection 181(5) of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15 (ETA) when it reimbursed Loblaws Inc. (Loblaws) as a result of PC Bank\u2019s credit card customers redeeming the points awarded to them by PC Bank, as payment towards a taxable supply (that is not a zero-rated supply) made by Loblaws.\n[63] In order to qualify for the NITC, PC Bank must have paid the reimbursement payment referred to above in the course of a commercial activity of PC Bank. The Tax Court found that PC Bank did not make the payment as contemplated by subsection 181(5) of the ETA in the course of a commercial activity of PC Bank and, therefore, PC Bank was not entitled to this NITC (2022 TCC 84, per Hogan J.).\n[64] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss this appeal.\nVII. Background [65] The Tax Court decision includes several excerpts from the partial agreed statement of facts submitted by the parties at the Tax Court hearing. Although there were a number of issues raised before the Tax Court, the only issue raised in this appeal relates to the NITC as provided in subsection 181(5) of the ETA. Therefore, only the facts relevant to this issue will be recited.\n[66] PC Bank is indirectly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Loblaws. PC Bank is listed in Schedule I to the Bank Act, S.C. 1991, c. 46 and is a listed financial institution for the purposes of the ETA. PC Bank is also registered for the purposes of Part IX of the ETA.\n[67] PC Bank issues President\u2019s Choice branded MasterCard credit cards to its customers (Cardholders). The Cardholders use these credit cards to make purchases and to obtain cash advances.\n[68] President\u2019s Choice Services Inc. (PCSI), an indirect subsidiary of Loblaws, acquired the points program from PC Bank, effective March 1, 2008. PCSI granted PC Bank, under the rectified Licence Agreement, a non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to issue points to PC Bank\u2019s customers (PCB Points). PC Bank acknowledged that it would be liable for the redemption of PCB Points. Under the points program, PC Bank\u2019s Cardholders are awarded PCB Points whenever they use their PC Bank MasterCard \u2014 20 PCB points for every $1 spent at a Loblaw-banner store where President\u2019s Choice products are sold and 10 PCB points for every $1 spent at other places (paragraph 15 of the partial agreed statement of facts as set out in paragraph 7 of the reasons of the Tax Court Judge).\n[69] The PCB Points can be redeemed as payments towards purchases made at Loblaws stores (including certain stores owned by a subsidiary of Loblaws and certain franchises operating under a trademark owned or controlled by Loblaws).\n[70] The Loyalty Expense Agreement entered into by PC Bank, PCSI and Loblaws, as rectified, provided for the following payments, as set out in paragraph 18 of the partial agreed statement of facts:\na. for every $1.00 of purchases made by Cardholders using their PC MasterCard at Loblaw Stores where PC Bank issues PCB Points to the Cardholder, Loblaws will pay $0.0075 to PC Bank;\nb. for every $1.00 of notional value of PCB Points accumulated by a Cardholder using a PC MasterCard and redeemed by such Cardholder, Loblaws will pay $0.35 to PC Bank; and\nc. for every $1.00 of notional value of PCB Points accumulated by a Cardholder using a PC MasterCard and redeemed by such Cardholder, PC Bank will reimburse\/pay [Loblaws] $1.00 (the \u201cRedemption Payment\u201d).\n[71] The NITC in issue in this appeal arises as a result of the redemption payments (Redemption Payments) as set out in paragraph c. above.\nVIII. Subsections 181(1), (2) and (5) of the ETA [72] Subsection 181(1) of the ETA sets out definitions for certain terms used in section 181. Subsection 181(2) of the ETA sets out the rules for determining the tax when a coupon is used. The NITC that is available to a person who reimburses a retailer for accepting a coupon is payable under subsection 181(5) of the ETA. The full text of these provisions is set out in the Appendix to these reasons.\n[73] At paragraph 17, the Tax Court Judge recited the following example, provided by the Crown and also adopted by PC Bank, to illustrate the operation of subsection 181(2) of the ETA:\n38. Consider, for example, a customer who uses a reimbursable coupon for $1.00 off of a $10 bottle of shampoo, before HST of 15%, at a retailer:\nPrice of the shampoo $10.00\nHST at 15% $1.50\nSubtotal $11.50\nLess coupon (1.00)\nCustomer pays $10.50\n39. In this example, the registrant (retailer) is deemed to have collected HST of $1.50 pursuant to subsection 181(2). It must report and remit $1.50 of HST.\n40. Pursuant to paragraph 181(2)(c), however, the recipient (customer) cannot claim an ITC of $1.50. The recipient\u2019s tax payable is deemed to be the tax collectible by the registrant (in this case, $1.50) less the tax fraction of the coupon value (in this case, $1.00\/ 1.15 = $0.13). Therefore, the recipient may claim an [input tax credit], if the purchase satisfies subsection 169(1) of the Act, in the amount of $1.37.\n[74] Although the example produces the correct result for the monetary amount for the tax fraction of the coupon value ($0.13), this result is not obtained by dividing $1.00 by 1.15 (which would be $0.87). Rather, the tax fraction, as determined in accordance with the definition of tax fraction as set out in subsection 181(1) of the ETA, is determined by dividing\n(a)the total of the rate set out in subsection 165(1) (currently 5%) and the tax rate for the participating province (10% in this example)\nby\n(b)the total of 100% and the amount determined under paragraph (a):\n(5% + 10%) \/ (115%) = 15\/115 = 0.13 (or 13%)\n[75] The result of the calculation of the tax fraction, as set out in the definition of tax fraction, is a fraction, not a monetary amount. Since the coupon in the above example is a $1 coupon, the monetary amount of the tax fraction of the coupon value would be 13% of $1 or $0.13.\n[76] Subsection 181(5) of the ETA allows the person who reimburses the retailer for the amount of the coupon to recover the monetary amount of the tax fraction of the coupon value ($0.13 in the example provided above) as a NITC, provided that the conditions imposed by subsection 181(5) of the ETA are satisfied.\n[77] The only dispute in this appeal relates to the entitlement of PC Bank to the NITCs. The calculation of the total amount of NITCs is not in dispute.\nIX. The Tax Court Decision [78] The only condition imposed by subsection 181(5) of the ETA that was in issue in the appeal to the Tax Court was whether PC Bank made the Redemption Payments to Loblaws in the course of a commercial activity of PC Bank (paragraph 9 of the reasons of the Tax Court Judge). The Tax Court Judge also noted, in paragraph 9:\nIf PC Bank made the Redemption Payment in the course of an exempt \u201cfinancial service\u201d, then the Redemption Payment could not have been made \u201cin the course of a commercial activity\u201d because the \u201ccommercial activity\u201d definition specifically excludes exempt supplies. PC Bank is only entitled to claim an NITC pursuant to subsection 181(5) if the Redemption Payment was made in the course of a \u201ccommercial activity\u201d of PC Bank.\n[79] The Tax Court Judge noted, in paragraph 10 of his reasons, that PC Bank\u2019s position at the Tax Court hearing was \u201cthat it made the Redemption Payments in the course of its operation of the Loyalty Program, which it states is a commercial activity\u201d. The Tax Court also noted that \u201c[f]or PC Bank, there is no basis to conclude that the Redemption Payment was made in the course of a different activity (i.e. the PC Bank MasterCard business)\u201d.\n[80] The Tax Court Judge reviewed the definitions of \u201ccommercial activity\u201d, \u201cexempt supply\u201d and \u201cfinancial service\u201d. There is no dispute that PC Bank\u2019s MasterCard credit card business is a financial service, and, therefore, that PC Bank is making exempt supplies in carrying on this business.\n[81] The Tax Court Judge found that the previous court decisions addressing subsection 181(5) of the ETA did not provide significant guidance in relation to the relevant issue in this appeal. Neither party is disputing this finding in the appeal to this Court.\n[82] In considering the meaning of the phrase \u201cin the course of\u201d, the Tax Court Judge found that this expression has a wide meaning. In paragraph 29 of his reasons, the Tax Court Judge quoted the following excerpts from Midland Hutterian Brethren v. Canada, [2000] G.S.T.C. 109, 195 D.L.R. (4th) 450 (FCA) (Midland Hutterian Brethren):\nThis Court has already interpreted these words to mean that, when a registrant incurs a GST expense in connection with its commercial activities, it is entitled to an ITC. As Stone J.A. explained in Metropolitan Toronto Hockey League [[1995] F.C.J. No. 944, [1995] G.S.T.C 31 (FCA)] decision:\nThe scheme of the Act allows a business to claim refund or credit of any tax paid on the purchase or services connected to its sale of taxable supplies. In this way the tax is ultimately paid only by the final non commercial purchaser of a taxable supply.\nWhen the phrase \u201cconnected to\u201d was used by Justice Stone to explain the words in the statute, the meaning it conveyed was that the supplies must contribute to the production of articles or the provision of services that are taxable. It would not be enough to qualify as being connected to the business activity if something, like a cigarette, were merely consumed while engaged in the business activity, for that would not contribute to the commercial activity that will ultimately produce taxable supplies.\nThere is no language in subsection 169(1) that requires the use in question to be exclusively commercial or that distinguishes between property acquired and used directly and property acquired and altered before its use in commercial activities. Once an item is found to be acquired and used in connection with the commercial activities of a GST registrant and that item directly or indirectly contributes to the production of articles or the provision of services that are taxable, then an ITC is available using the formula in that subsection. Any possible abuse is to be combatted by requiring evidence of intended use and an adjustment in the percentage of ITC allowed by the Minister.\n[Emphasis added by the FCA.]\n[83] The Tax Court Judge also noted, at paragraph 32, that when a person carries on a business of making taxable supplies and also carries on a business of making exempt supplies, the business that consists of making exempt supplies is notionally severed from the other business, as stated by this Court in Canada v. 398722 Alberta Ltd., [2000] G.S.T.C. 32, [2000] F.C.J. No. 644:\n[22] Any business may consist of a number of components, each of which is integral to the business as a whole. The definition of \u201ccommercial activity\u201d recognizes that possibility but requires, for GST purposes, that any part of the business that consists of making exempt supplies be notionally severed. The statutory definition dictates that the business of the respondent is not a \u201ccommercial activity\u201d in so far as it consists of the rental of the units of the four-plex. On that basis I agree with the Crown that the respondent is not entitled to an input tax credit to offset the GST payable on the self-supply of the four-plex.\n[84] The Tax Court Judge considered the historical overview of the points program (which was also referred to as the loyalty program) and he reviewed the relevant agreements: the Licence Agreement, the rectified Loyalty Services Agreement, and the rectified Loyalty Expense Agreement. He also considered the testimony of the witnesses.\n[85] His key findings include the following:\n[65] \u2026 I endorse the Respondent\u2019s theory, which is that PC Bank became liable to make the Redemption Payments to Loblaws in the course of its MasterCard business. PC Bank issued the PCB Points to Cardholders to reward them for making purchases using their PC MasterCard.\n[66] The question in dispute must be answered from the perspective of PC Bank, a distinct legal entity subject to the GST consequence with respect to its inputs, redemption expenses and supplies. This is clear from the part of subsection 181(5) that provides that \u201ca particular person [PC Bank] at any time pays, in the course of a commercial activity of the particular person [PC Bank]\u201d. The evidence must be examined to determine the reason or cause for the Redemption Payment. Stated differently, is the Redemption Payment linked to the making of exempt or taxable supplies by PC Bank?\n[67] In my opinion, the Redemption Payments were made in the course of PC Bank\u2019s MasterCard activity, which involves the provision of exempt supplies of financial services to Cardholders. PC Bank issued the PCB Points to generate revenue from its PC MasterCard portfolio. PC Bank earned significant revenue from interchange fees that pales in comparison [sic] to the minimal revenue it received from Loblaws. PC Bank is a highly regarded legal entity licensed to carry on certain banking operations for profit. It is inconceivable to me that PC Bank made the Redemption Payments to lose money.\n\u2026\n[73] PC Bank\u2019s business consists of earning money from a profitable credit card business. Even from the consolidated reporting perspective (i.e. LCL [Loblaw Companies Limited]), the reporting on the financial services segment (i.e. PC Bank) looks at how profitable the PC Bank credit card business was. It earns substantially all of its net income from that activity. It is my view that PC Bank obtained the right to issue PCB Points to Cardholders for the purpose of enticing them to acquire the PC MasterCard in the first place and thereafter for the purpose of encouraging Cardholders to use their PC MasterCards.\n\u2026\n[82] As noted earlier, the focus of subsection 181(5) is squarely on PC Bank. What caused PC Bank to make the Redemption Payment? After considering the testimonial evidence, my opinion remains the same. PC Bank issued the PCB Points to attract clients to subscribe for and, more importantly, thereafter use their PC MasterCards. This was done to grow PC Bank\u2019s MasterCard operations. PC Bank made the Redemption Payment for the redeemed PCB Points as consideration for having issued the PCB Points in the first place.\n[86] The Tax Court Judge found, at paragraph 85, that PC Bank made the Redemption Payments in carrying on its financial services business and, therefore, it was not entitled to the NITC as provided in subsection 181(5) of the ETA.\nX. Issue and Standard of Review [87] In its memorandum, PC Bank stated:\n29. The issue on this appeal is whether the TCC Judge erred in interpreting the phrase \u201cin the course of a commercial activity\u201d in subsection 181(5) of the ETA.\n30. The TCC Judge failed to conduct a textual, contextual, and purposive interpretation and erred in his interpretation of the provision in three respects:\n(a) He misinterpreted the text of the provision, which does not require that PC Bank make the Redemption Payment \u201cexclusively\u201d or \u201cprimarily\u201d in the course of a commercial activity;\n(b) He relied on the fact that PC Bank\u2019s primary business is the credit card business, even though the taxpayer\u2019s primary business is not a relevant consideration under subsection 181(5); and\n(c) He relied on the fact that PC Bank earns profits from the credit card business but not its commercial activities with Loblaws, which is also not a relevant consideration under subsection 181(5).\n[88] At the hearing of this appeal, PC Bank reframed the issues as:\n(a)\u201cin the course of\u201d is not an \u201ceither\/or\u201d test;\n(b)\u201ccommercial activity\u201d does not require an expectation of profit for corporations; and\n(c)the \u201ccore business\u201d of PC Bank does not determine its entitlement to the NITCs under subsection 181(5) of the ETA.\n[89] Although PC Bank also submitted that it was entitled to the NITC based on its view of the proper interpretation of subsection 181(5) of the ETA, the conclusion that PC Bank is entitled to the NITCs will only need to be addressed if PC Bank is successful in its arguments concerning the correct interpretation of subsection 181(5) of the ETA.\n[90] PC Bank is not challenging any of the factual findings made by the Tax Court Judge. The only issue relates to the interpretation of subsection 181(5) of the ETA, which is a question of law. The standard of review is therefore correctness (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33).\nXI. Analysis [91] Statutory provisions are to be interpretated based on a textual, contextual and purposive analysis (Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, at para. 10). The interpretation issue is focused on the following phrase in subsection 181(5) of the ETA:\n\u2026 a particular person at any time pays, in the course of a commercial activity of the particular person, an amount to the supplier for the redemption of the coupon \u2026\n[92] This text, which focuses on the payment of an amount in the course of a commercial activity, is unique to subsection 181(5) of the ETA. PC Bank stated that it could not find any other provision of the ETA that used this language.\n[93] PC Bank does not dispute the finding of the Tax Court Judge that the Redemption Payments were made by PC Bank in carrying on its credit card business and therefore were made in carrying on a financial services business. Rather, PC Bank argues that the Tax Court erred in law by failing to consider that the same Redemption Payments were also made in the course of a commercial activity.\n[94] PC Bank framed this issue as whether \u201cin the course of\u201d is an \u201ceither\/or\u201d test. PC Bank submits that, in addition to carrying on a financial services business, it is also carrying on a commercial activity: \u201cits service of driving retail traffic to Loblaws\u201d (paragraph 62 of PC Bank\u2019s memorandum). The Tax Court Judge, in paragraph 10 of his reasons, stated that PC Bank had identified its commercial activity as follows: \u201cPC Bank\u2019s position is that it made the Redemption Payments in the course of its operation of the Loyalty Program, which it states is a commercial activity\u201d. The Tax Court Judge also acknowledged at paragraph 78 that Ms. Davis, the Chief Financial Officer of Loblaw Companies Limited at the relevant time for this appeal, \u201cemphasized that the main purpose of the Loyalty Program was to \u2018drive more retail traffic\u2019 to Loblaws\u201d.\n[95] As noted in paragraph 79 above, the Tax Court Judge stated at paragraph 10 of his reasons that \u201c[f]or PC Bank, there is no basis to conclude that the Redemption Payment was made in the course of a different activity (i.e. the PC Bank MasterCard business)\u201d. Since PC Bank was arguing that the Redemption Payments were only made in the course of a commercial activity, it would appear that PC Bank\u2019s argument that the Redemption Payments could be found to have been made both in carrying on a financial services business and in the course of a commercial activity was not made at the Tax Court hearing.\n[96] PC Bank\u2019s argument concerning its commercial activity \u2014 \u201cits service of driving retail traffic to Loblaws\u201d \u2014 is based on the Minister of National Revenue assessing tax under the ETA on the payments as described in paragraphs 18 a. and b. of the partial agreed statement of facts as set out in paragraph 70 above:\na. for every $1.00 of purchases made by Cardholders using their PC MasterCard at Loblaw Stores where PC Bank issues PCB Points to the Cardholder, Loblaws will pay $0.0075 to PC Bank;\nb. for every $1.00 of notional value of PCB Points accumulated by a Cardholder using a PC MasterCard and redeemed by such Cardholder, Loblaws will pay $0.35 to PC Bank; \u2026\n[97] The Crown disputes that these payments were made in the course of a commercial activity. However, tax under the ETA is only imposed on taxable supplies (subsection 165(1) of the ETA) and taxable supplies are supplies made in the course of a commercial activity (definition of taxable supply in subsection 123(1) of the ETA). Whether tax should have been imposed on these payments is not in issue in this appeal. For the purposes of this appeal, since tax was imposed it will be assumed that the tax was properly imposed and, therefore, that PC Bank was carrying on a commercial activity, in addition to its financial services business. Whether the Redemption Payments were made in the course of this commercial activity is a separate question of fact or mixed fact and law.\n[98] The question is whether PC Bank paid the Redemption Payments to Loblaws in the course of its commercial activity, not whether PC Bank acquired any particular property or service for consumption, use or supply in the course of a commercial activity (as would be the case for the determination under subsection 169(1) of the ETA of an input tax credit when a person acquires a particular property or service). PC Bank confirmed during the hearing of this appeal that no property or service was acquired by PC Bank for the Redemption Payments. Although PC Bank submitted that its commercial activity was \u201cits service of driving retail traffic to Loblaws\u201d, PC Bank submitted that it did not make the Redemption Payments to Loblaws for the purpose of driving retail traffic to Loblaws, but rather that the Redemption Payments were made to pay a liability of PC Bank.\n[99] Whether the Redemption Payments were made in the course of a commercial activity of PC Bank is a question of fact or mixed fact and law as the interpretation of certain contracts is relevant. As noted by the majority of this Court in Midland Hutterian Brethren:\nWhen the phrase \u201cconnected to\u201d was used by Justice Stone to explain the words in the statute, the meaning it conveyed was that the supplies must contribute to the production of articles or the provision of services that are taxable. It would not be enough to qualify as being connected to the business activity if something, like a cigarette, were merely consumed while engaged in the business activity, for that would not contribute to the commercial activity that will ultimately produce taxable supplies.\n[100] In Midland Hutterian Brethren, this Court confirmed that a particular property or service is acquired for consumption or use in the course of a commercial activity if the property or service contributed to the commercial activity. In applying this principle to determine if a person pays an amount in the course of a commercial activity, paying such amount must contribute to the commercial activity. In this case, the question is whether making the Redemption Payments contributed to the commercial activity of PC Bank, which PC Bank is now describing as a \u201cservice of driving retail traffic to Loblaws\u201d.\n[101] Whether the Redemption Payments made to Loblaws contributed to the commercial activity of PC Bank\u2019s \u201cservice of driving retail traffic to Loblaws\u201d, is a question of fact or mixed fact and law. There was no finding of fact made by the Tax Court Judge that the Redemption Payments were made in the course of a commercial activity of PC Bank. Rather, the Tax Court Judge found, in paragraph 72 of his reasons, that \u201cPC Bank has not identified the commercial activity for which it claims entitlement to NITCs\u201d and at paragraph 76, \u201cPC Bank issues the points and pays their redemption price \u2026 to earn income from the supply of financial services\u201d.\n[102] In this appeal, PC Bank has not challenged any factual findings made by the Tax Court Judge, including the finding that \u201cPC Bank has not identified the commercial activity for which it claims entitlement to NITCs\u201d. The only issue raised in this appeal is the question of law, which PC Bank identified as the \u201ceither\/or\u201d question. PC Bank\u2019s argument is that the Tax Court Judge, having found that the Redemption Payments were paid in carrying on a financial services business, erred by not considering whether PC Bank also paid the same amounts in the course of a commercial activity. However, since PC Bank has not appealed any findings of fact, the Tax Court Judge\u2019s factual finding that \u201cPC Bank has not identified the commercial activity for which it claims entitlement to NITCs\u201d stands.\n[103] In my view, in order to address the legal question of whether the Redemption Payments could have been made both in carrying on a financial services business and in the course of a commercial activity, PC Bank would first have had to establish, at the Tax Court, in the course of what commercial activity PC Bank is alleging that the payments were made. Since the factual finding that PC Bank has not identified the particular commercial activity has not been challenged in this appeal, it is not open to PC Bank, in this appeal, to now attempt to establish a finding of fact that PC Bank failed to establish at the Tax Court hearing.\n[104] However, since, in my view as noted above in paragraph 97, the Crown cannot argue that no commercial activity was being carried on by PC Bank, the legal question of whether the Redemption Payments could be made in carrying on a financial services business and also in the course of a commercial activity will be addressed.\n[105] PC Bank linked this legal question to the interpretation of \u201cin the course of\u201d. In my view, however, this is not the relevant question. The question is not whether \u201cin the course of\u201d has a broad meaning and whether a particular good or service that has been acquired could be found to have been acquired for use in a commercial activity and also in a financial services business. Rather, the relevant question is whether the particular payment of money, as contemplated by subsection 181(5) of the ETA, could be made in carrying on a financial services business and the same payment of money could also be made in the course of a commercial activity.\n[106] Subsection 181(5) of the ETA contemplates a payment of money, not an acquisition of any good or service:\n\u2026 a particular person at any time pays, in the course of a commercial activity of the particular person, an amount to the supplier for the redemption of the coupon \u2026\n[Emphasis added.]\n[107] To illustrate PC Bank\u2019s legal argument related to whether the payment contemplated by subsection 181(5) of the ETA could be made in the course of a commercial activity and also in carrying on a financial services business, assume that a particular Redemption Payment made as a result of a customer redeeming PCB Points is $10. PC Bank\u2019s argument is that this $10 can be found to have been paid in the course of a commercial activity and this same $10 can also be found to be paid in carrying on its financial services business. As more fully discussed below, I do not agree that this is the correct interpretation of subsection 181(5) of the ETA.\n[108] PC Bank referred to Midland Hutterian Brethren, Canada v. General Motors of Canada Limited, 2009 FCA 114 (General Motors), and Glencore Canada Corporation v. Canada, 2024 FCA 3, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 41149 (8 August 2024) (Glencore Canada) in support of its interpretation that a single payment could be made in the course of a commercial activity and in carrying on a financial services business.\n[109] Midland Hutterian Brethren and General Motors both relate to the entitlement to input tax credits under subsection 169(1) of the ETA. The full text of this provision is set out in the Appendix attached to these reasons. This subsection provides that a person is entitled to an input tax credit for a property or a service that is acquired for consumption, use or supply in the course of a commercial activity and prescribes the amount of such input tax credit that may be claimed.\n[110] In particular, subsection 169(1) of the ETA limits the entitlement to input tax credits to the extent that the particular property or service is acquired for consumption, use or supply in the course of a commercial activity of the person. This limitation is reflected in the formula (A x B) set out in subsection 169(1) of the ETA. The scheme of the ETA is that a particular property or service cannot be considered to be used 100% in carrying on a business of making exempt supplies and 100% in the course of a commercial activity. Given this context, in my view, Parliament would not have intended that the entire payment of a particular amount could be considered to be made both in carrying on a financial services business and in the course of a commercial activity.\n[111] Neither Midland Hutterian Brethren nor General Motors address the issue of whether a single payment can be made in the course of a commercial activity and also made in carrying on a financial services business. In my view, it does not necessarily follow that because the ETA contemplates that a particular property or service may be acquired for use in more than one activity, Parliament contemplated that the person paid the full amount for the property in the course of each activity.\n[112] To illustrate, assume that a person pays $100 to acquire a particular property. Assume the property is used 60% in the course of a commercial activity and 40% in carrying on a financial services business. By recognizing that the property is used 60% in the course of a commercial activity and 40% in carrying on a financial services business, in my view, it does not necessarily follow that Parliament contemplated that the $100 was paid in the course of a commercial activity and the same $100 was also paid in carrying on a financial services business.\n[113] In Glencore Canada the relevant issue was whether a particular amount was \u201creceived in the course of earning income from a business or property\u201d for the purposes of paragraph 12(1)(x) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (ITA). Since Glencore Canada related to a different statute (the ITA versus the ETA) and the inclusion of an amount in income for the purposes of the ITA, it is also of no assistance in determining whether a single payment can be made in the course of a commercial activity and also in carrying on a financial services business for the purposes of subsection 181(5) of the ETA.\n[114] The text of subsection 181(5) of the ETA indicates that the payment of the amount in the course of a commercial activity is a condition that must be satisfied and that this condition is either satisfied or it is not:\n\u2026 a particular person at any time pays, in the course of a commercial activity of the particular person, an amount to the supplier for the redemption of the coupon \u2026\n[115] The section contemplates \u201ca particular person at any time\u201d paying \u201can amount\u201d and is seeking a response of either:\nyes, the particular person paid that amount in the course of a commercial activity; or\nno, the person did not pay that amount in the course of a commercial activity.\n[116] The relevant condition in subsection 181(5) of the ETA is focused on making a payment. A person only pays a particular amount once. The person does not pay the same amount twice. Having found that PC Bank paid the entire amount of the Redemption Payments in carrying on a financial services business, there was no amount, in relation to the Redemption Payments, that could be found to be paid in another activity.\n[117] In my view, Parliament intended to focus on the single payment transaction and whether, on a balance of probabilities, the person pays the particular amount in the course of a commercial activity. If, on a balance of probabilities, the person pays the particular amount in carrying on a financial services business, the person is not entitled to the NITC. If there are two possible activities (e.g. a commercial activity and a financial services business), the issue for the Court to determine is whether, on a balance of probabilities, the person pays the particular amount in the course of a commercial activity.\n[118] A single payment could be considered to be, in part, made in the course of a commercial activity and, in part, made in carrying on a financial services business. For example, a payment of $10 could be allocated between the two activities \u2014 $6 to the commercial activity and $4 to the financial services business. However, this is not PC Bank\u2019s argument. PC Bank is not disputing that, for a Redemption Payment of $10, the $10 was paid in carrying on its financial services business. PC Bank\u2019s argument is that the entire payment of $10 (in this example) would be considered to be paid both in the course of a commercial activity and in carrying on a financial services business.\n[119] The definition of commercial activity in subsection 123(1) of the ETA is also relevant. The full text of this definition is set out in the Appendix attached to these reasons. Paragraph (a) of the definition of commercial activity provides that to the extent that a business involves the making of exempt supplies, it is not a commercial activity:\n\u2026 a business carried on by the person \u2026 except to the extent to which the business involves the making of exempt supplies by the person \u2026\n[120] An activity cannot be both a business of making exempt supplies and a commercial activity. Since an activity cannot be both a business of making exempt supplies and a commercial activity, it would seem logical that Parliament would not have intended that a single payment could, at the same time, be considered to be made both in the course of a commercial activity and in carrying on a business of making exempt supplies, such as a financial services business.\n[121] In paragraph 48 of its memorandum, PC Bank referred to several provisions of the ETA that refer to the acquisition of property or a service exclusively or primarily in the course of a commercial activity:\n48. Where Parliament intended to limit the recovery of ITCs to taxpayers who make a supply or payment \u201cexclusively\u201d or \u201cprimarily\u201d in the course of a commercial activity, it did so expressly. For instance, subsection 202(2), which governs the recovery of ITCs on the acquisition of a passenger vehicle or aircraft, requires that a passenger vehicle or aircraft acquired by an individual or partnership be used \u201cexclusively\u201d in the course of commercial activities. Paragraph 199(2)(a), which governs the recovery of ITCs on the acquisition of capital personal property, permits ITCs on supplies acquired for use \u201cprimarily\u201d in a commercial activity. Section 141.02 refers to inputs that are used \u201cdirectly and exclusively\u201d for the purpose of making taxable supplies.\n[Emphasis added by PC Bank.]\n[122] These provisions all refer to the use of the particular property or service that is acquired, not to the payment of a single amount.\n[123] In my view, there is a distinction to be drawn between acquiring a particular property or service for use in a commercial or other activity and the paying of an amount. A particular property may be used multiple times in different activities and a service may be rendered in part to one activity and in part to a different activity. Therefore, a property or service could be used primarily or exclusively in a particular activity. In my view, these provisions do not assist PC Bank.\n[124] PC Bank argues that because subsection 181(5) of the ETA does not require that \u201ca person pays an amount exclusively or primarily\u201d, the same payment can be found to have been made in carrying on a financial services business and in the course of a commercial activity. However, in my view, the text \u201ca particular person at any time pays, in the course of a commercial activity of the particular person, an amount\u201d, requires a focus on the particular payment that is made and requires a determination of whether it was made in the course of a commercial activity or otherwise. This language, in my view, does not support the proposition that a single payment (which is only made once) can be considered to be paid twice \u2014 once in carrying on, in this case, a financial services business and again in the course of a commercial activity.\n[125] A person only pays a single payment once. Just as the scheme of the ETA does not contemplate that 100% of a particular property or service that is acquired can be considered to be used in both a commercial activity and a business of making exempt supplies, Parliament did not intend that 100% of a single payment that is made could be considered to be made in both the course of a commercial activity and in the making of exempt supplies.\n[126] In Nestl\u00e9 Canada Inc. v. The Queen, 2017 TCC 33, Lamarre A.C.J. described the policy underlying the treatment of coupons under the ETA:\n[39] Subsection 181(2) thus requires the customer to overpay GST\/HST on the Nestl\u00e9 products and then deems the customer to have paid only the GST\/HST attributable to the post-discount price. The reason for implementing this practice was explained by counsel for the Respondent in his oral submissions, in which he referred the Court to the policy underlying the treatment of discount coupons. The object of the practice was to simplify the treatment of coupons for small grocers, who, in the 1990s, did not have easy access to cash registers that, for the purpose of the application of the GST\/HST, could distinguish between coupons for taxable supplies and coupons for non-taxable (or zero-rated) supplies.\n[40] This excess GST\/HST does not go to the government however. Instead, subsection 181(5) allows the provider of the coupon, here Nestl\u00e9, to obtain an input tax credit for the excess GST\/HST paid by the Costco customer.\n[127] The rules related to the tax treatment of coupons were implemented to simplify the process for retailers, as not all retailers had access to cash registers that could properly process coupons for taxable supplies and for non-taxable supplies. The available NITC under subsection 181(5) of the ETA was also simplified by not requiring any proration of the reimbursement payment made to the retailer. All of the NITC would be paid to the person who pays the redemption amount of the coupon in the course of a commercial activity.\n[128] The general rule for input tax credits provides that such credits are only available to the extent that a particular property or service is acquired for consumption, use or supply in the course of a commercial activity. If a particular property or service is acquired only for consumption, use or supply in a carrying on a business of making exempt supplies, the person is not entitled to any input tax credit. Although no property or service is acquired as a result of making the reimbursement payment to a retailer as contemplated by subsection 181(5) of the ETA, the general principle that there is a link between the entitlement to an input tax credit and the extent of a connection to a commercial activity, should be maintained. In my view, Parliament would not have intended that the entire NITC would be made to a person who, on a balance of probabilities, does not pay the amount contemplated by subsection 181(5) of the ETA in the course of a commercial activity.\n[129] Rather, Parliament would have intended that the NITC would be paid to a person who, on a balance of probabilities, paid the amount in the course of a commercial activity. The question of whether a particular amount was paid in the course of a commercial activity is a question of fact (or mixed fact and law to the extent that the interpretation of any contracts is relevant).\n[130] In my view, based on the text, context and purpose of subsection 181(5) of the ETA, the correct interpretation is that when a person is carrying on a commercial activity and also a financial services business, the person pays the amount as contemplated by this subsection either in the course of a commercial activity or in carrying on a financial services business. A person only pays a particular amount once and therefore the person, for the purposes of subsection 181(5) of the ETA, either pays the particular amount in the course of carrying on a commercial activity or in carrying on some other activity. The full amount of a single payment cannot be considered to be made both in the course of a commercial activity and also, at the same time, made in carrying on a financial services business.\n[131] Since, as acknowledged by PC Bank, the Redemption Payments were made to satisfy a liability of PC Bank, the appropriate question to ask is the question as framed by the Tax Court Judge in paragraph 66 of his reasons:\nThe evidence must be examined to determine the reason or cause for the Redemption Payment. Stated differently, is the Redemption Payment linked to the making of exempt or taxable supplies by PC Bank?\n[132] Having framed the appropriate question, the Tax Court Judge did not commit any legal errors. His findings of fact have not been challenged in this appeal. In particular his key finding in paragraph 82 of his reasons is dispositive:\nPC Bank issued the PCB Points to attract clients to subscribe for and, more importantly, thereafter use their PC MasterCards. This was done to grow PC Bank\u2019s MasterCard operations. PC Bank made the Redemption Payment for the redeemed PCB Points as consideration for having issued the PCB Points in the first place.\n[133] As a result, the Redemption Payments made by PC Bank to Loblaws were made by PC Bank in carrying on its financial services business and not in the course of a commercial activity. Therefore, PC Bank is not entitled to the NITCs under subsection 181(5) of the ETA in relation to the Redemption Payments.\n[134] Although PC Bank argued that the Tax Court Judge erred by relying on financial data and the primary business of PC Bank, the financial data and the primary business of PC Bank are part of the factual matrix that the Tax Court Judge considered in determining whether the Redemption Payments were made in the course of a commercial activity or in carrying on a financial services business. The Tax Court Judge did not make any finding that the definition of \u201ccommercial activity\u201d required a corporation to carry on a business with a reasonable expectation of profit or that subsection 181(5) of the ETA required the payment in issue to be made as part of the core business of PC Bank.\nXII. Conclusion [135] As a result, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\u201cWyman W. Webb\u201d\nJ.A.\nAPPENDIX\nProvisions of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.

The Federal Court agreed and found CP in contempt for some, but not all, of the asserted violations (Teamsters Canada Rail Conference v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company, 2023 FC 796, 2023 CarswellNat 2187). CP appeals the decision.\n[2] I would allow the appeal. The Federal Court misdirected itself as to the law of civil contempt. It is sufficient at this point to say that the Court erred in finding contempt in the absence of intent, effectively treating contempt as a strict or absolute liability offence. The Court erred in jettisoning the directing mind principle, which guides the inquiry into the guilt or responsibility of a corporation facing quasi-criminal or criminal charges, and in excluding due diligence or reasonable efforts defences from the contempt analysis. This conflicts with established case law, including that of the Supreme Court.\n[3] None of the facts as found by the Federal Court judge are in dispute, and for reasons which I will explain, it is impossible to rationalize a finding of contempt with the facts as found. In light of these findings of fact there is only one outcome possible, which is to set aside the finding of contempt and substitute a decision dismissing the motion for contempt.\nFactual Background [4] Provisions in the collective agreement between CP and Teamsters address the circumstances under which CP is required to relieve a train crew from duty (the rest provisions). With some exceptions, a train crew must be relieved within 10 or 12 hours, depending on whether rest is in fact requested by the crew.\n[5] Train movement between terminals is managed by CP through its Crew Management Centre. The Crew Management Centre manages the train\u2019s trip, ensures compliance with regulatory requirements, orders relief crews and arranges for transportation if a crew is pulled off the train in order to comply with the rest provisions. Each train terminal also has a local management team that assists in managing train crews. CP has approximately 250,000 train crew starts each year.\n[6] In March 2018, a labour arbitrator found that CP violated the rest provisions (the Award). The Award explained that \u201c[b]eyond [certain] negotiated situations, and subject perhaps to arguments of force majeure [as distinct from unforeseen circumstances]\u2026 [the parties] have agreed that employees may exercise a right to be off duty within 10 hours\u201d and that \u201cthe parties have included no wording in the collective agreement that employees lose their right to be off within 10 hours whenever something unexpected comes up during their tour of duty\u201d (Federal Court decision at paras. 20-26 and 101, citing the Award at paras. 105 and 220).\n[7] CP did not seek judicial review of the Award. The Award was filed with the Federal Court later that month, making it an order of the Federal Court pursuant to subsection 66(2) of the Canada Labour Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. L-2.\n[8] In June 2019, Teamsters filed a show cause motion pursuant to the contempt rules of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106 (rules 466-472), alleging that there had been 38 violations of the Award.\nDecision Below [9] The Federal Court found CP guilty of contempt with respect to 22 of the 38 incidents.\n[10] The Court first reviewed the evidence, including the testimony of the witnesses for the parties, but noted that it preferred the documentary evidence before it. The Court concluded that \u201cCP took significant and meaningful steps to comply with the [] Award\u201d, including reporting multiple times a week on its performance and holding bi-weekly calls with Teamsters to discuss any deviations from the rest provisions (Federal Court decision at paras. 34-58).\n[11] The Court then turned to the test for civil contempt, citing Carey v. Laiken, 2015 SCC 17, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 79 at paras. 32-35 [Carey]. The party alleging contempt must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: the order or judgment at issue clearly and unequivocally states what should be done or should not be done; the alleged contemnor had actual knowledge of the order or judgment; and the alleged contemnor intentionally did or omitted to do the act compelled by the order or judgment.\n[12] CP conceded that the first two elements of the test were met, and the Court agreed based on the evidence before it (Federal Court decision at paras. 62-63).\n[13] Turning to the third criterion of Carey, the Court rejected CP\u2019s argument that reasonable efforts to comply with the Award constituted evidence that CP lacked the necessary intention to be found in contempt (Federal Court decision at paras. 65-67 and 71 and following). The Court concluded that there was not \u201ca distinctive category\u201d of contempt for corporate defendants, holding that CP\u2019s arguments were but \u201cnuances\u201d in the Carey test (Federal Court decision at para. 71). The cases relied on by CP, which pointed to a requirement of intention and a defence of reasonable efforts, were all distinguishable, according to the judge.\n[14] The Court distinguished Envacon Inc v. 829693 Alberta Ltd., 2018 ABCA 313, 426 D.L.R. (4th) 472 [Envacon] as it was decided under specific language in the Alberta Rules of Court, Alta. Reg. 124\/2010. Doucette v. Morin, 2015 SKQB 259, [2016] 2 W.W.R. 709 [Doucette] was distinguishable as individual third parties frustrated the compliance efforts of the party subject to the order. The Court noted that the third-party relationships in the cases relied upon by CP were \u201cfundamentally different from an employer-employee relationship where the employer is a party to the order\u201d (Federal Court decision at paras. 72-77).\n[15] I will return to these cases later in these reasons and explain why the decisions in Envacon and Doucette, of the Alberta Court of Appeal and Saskatchewan Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, together with Carey, were directly on point and provided clear guidance on the questions before the Federal Court.\n[16] The Court also rejected CP\u2019s argument that the Court should consider whether CP\u2019s directing minds intended for there to be a breach of the Award, as there is \u201cno such \u2018exemption\u2019 in the relevant case law.\u201d The Court cited Tele-Direct (Publications) Inc. v. Canadian Business Online Inc., 1998 CanLII 8528 (FC), 151 F.T.R. 271 [Tele-Direct], and Baxter Travenol Laboratories v. Cutter (Canada) Ltd., 1984 CanLII 5316 (FC), [1986] 1 F.C. 497 [Baxter], which held that the vicarious liability principle applies in corporate civil contempt cases (Federal Court decision at paras. 78-80).\n[17] In declining to find contempt for 16 of the 38 incidents, the Court pointed to various factors: for some incidents external factors caused the violation (such as issues with the taxis hired to transport train crews, a lack of control over foreign territory, and unexpected mechanical failures); for other incidents there was a lack of evidence. Specifically, four alleged yarding (parking and securing a train) breaches suffered from a lack of evidence, as yarding practices were subject to specific requirements under the Award (Federal Court decision at paras. 7 and 85-89). However, two other yarding incidents\u2014incidents 31 and 33\u2014were found to be contemptuous, without explanation (Federal Court decision at para. 90; Agreed Statement of Facts, Appeal Book at pp. 862 and 864).\n[18] The Court found that the evidence for the remaining 22 incidents established that the violations were within CP\u2019s control, and thus found CP in contempt for those incidents. Eleven of those violations occurred on a single day, \u201cdue to a series of bad decisions by inexperienced managers\u201d who did not follow established protocol (Federal Court decision at paras. 90-96). The other 11 incidents also resulted from poor operations management or errors of judgment by CP employees responsible for managing train crews (Federal Court decision at paras. 98-100).\n[19] The Court acknowledged that full compliance with the Award was a \u201ccomplex undertaking\u201d. However, as the parties negotiated and agreed upon the rules in the collective agreements, CP could not claim that compliance was impossible as this would undercut the collective agreement. Additionally, the evidence demonstrated that compliance with the Award was possible, even if difficult; compliance with the Award was at one point as high as 99% (Federal Court decision at paras. 101-106).\n[20] The Court did not exercise its discretion to not make a finding of contempt. Later in these reasons I will return to the adequacy of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons given for this decision. The Court left the questions of penalty and costs for a later day. In a subsequent proceeding (Teamsters Canada Rail Conference v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company, 2024 FC 125, 2024 W.C.B. 124, or the Federal Court sentencing decision), the Court directed CP to pay $200,000 to a registered charity.\nIssues and the Parties\u2019 Positions [21] The questions raised by this appeal engage several interrelated concepts: the requirement of intent in civil contempt, how intent is established in respect of corporations, the concept of strict or vicarious liability on the part of contemptuous corporations, defences to charges of contempt, and the use of discretion not to make a finding of contempt.\n[22] I note at the outset that the sanctions for contempt, whether arising in the civil or criminal context, are potentially significant: they include public opprobrium, imprisonment, and fines. This has both substantive and procedural implications, including the requirement for proof beyond a reasonable doubt to make out the offence (see rules 469 and 472 of the Federal Courts Rules). The onus, which never shifts, is on the moving party to establish all three elements of the offence. The Supreme Court has cautioned against finding contempt too quickly: \u201c[i]t is an enforcement power of last rather than first resort\u201d (Carey at para. 36).\n[23] The essence of the appellant\u2019s argument is that the Federal Court erred by effectively treating civil contempt as a strict liability offence. Even if the actus reus of contempt (the failure to comply with the order in question) had been proven, the mental element\u2014which requires subjective intention\u2014was not made out. To the contrary, the Court found that CP\u2019s subjective intention was the opposite: it intended to comply. CP asserts that while an intention to do the act that breaches the order can be inferred from the fact of non-compliance, this can only be done where that is the only reasonable inference that may be drawn (see Doucette at paras. 37-38; Amalgamated Transit Union, Local No. 569 v. Edmonton (City), 2015 ABQB 620, [2016] 5 W.W.R. 767 at para. 31 [Amalgamated Transit Union]; and Grain Workers' Union (ILWU, Local 333) v. Viterra Inc. 2022 FC 796 at paras. 138-139 [Viterra]).\n[24] More specifically, the appellant asserts that the Federal Court erred by not examining whether CP\u2019s directing minds had a subjective intention to commit the violations. Canadian Dredge & Dock Co. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 662, 1985 CanLII 32 (SCC) [Canadian Dredge] requires that quasi-criminal intent must be found in the directing minds of the corporation. The obiter in Tele-Direct, relied on by the Federal Court for the proposition that vicarious liability applies in corporate contempt, is distinguishable as it pre-dates Carey.\n[25] The respondent submits that the Federal Court explicitly acknowledged that contempt is not a strict liability offence and only found contempt established for certain violations of the Award. Knowing disobedience or commission of the act of non-compliance alone on the part of a corporate defendant can ground a finding of subjective intention. The Court explicitly noted at paragraph 70 of its decision that simply establishing a violation of the rest provisions is insufficient to prove contempt, and from that the respondent argues that it can be inferred the judge necessarily imposed a requirement of intent and also made a finding of subjective intent.\n[26] The respondent also argues that the Federal Court did not err in holding that intent is not determined on the basis of directing mind principle. The mental element in contempt is distinct from the directing mind doctrine where the actus reus of the offence provides the necessary evidentiary foundation to find intention.\nStandard of review [27] The standards from Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, 2 S.C.R. 235 govern this appeal. The facts in this appeal are not at issue. With the exception of the finding of contempt for the two yarding incidents noted, the appeal raises discrete questions of law.\nAnalysis Strict liability, absolute liability, and mens rea offences\n[28] The point of departure for the analysis begins with an understanding of the differences between mens rea offences (or \u201ctrue criminal offences\u201d), strict liability offences, and absolute liability offences. The guiding authority on this remains: R. v. Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, 1978 CanLII 11 (SCC) at 1325-1326 [Sault Ste. Marie]:\n(i)true criminal offences, \u201cin which mens rea, consisting of some positive state of mind such as intent, knowledge, or recklessness, must be proved by the prosecution\u201d;\n(ii)strict liability offences, \u201cin which there is no necessity for the prosecution to prove the existence of mens rea; the doing of the prohibited act prima facie imports the offence, leaving it open to the accused to avoid liability by proving that he took all reasonable care\u201d;\n(iii)absolute liability offences, in which \u201cit is not open to the accused to exculpate himself by showing that he was free of fault\u201d.\n[29] It is readily apparent that the analysis of the Federal Court cannot be rationalized with Sault Ste. Marie or any orthodox understanding of civil contempt. Contempt is not a strict liability offence. Contempt is not an absolute liability offence. As Carey makes clear, the mental element in civil contempt is \u201crequired\u201d (at para. 43). The reason for this lies in the penalties and consequences of a finding of contempt.\n[30] While the Federal Court stated that contempt was not a strict liability offence, it simultaneously discarded the directing mind inquiry and rejected reasonable excuse or due diligence as defences. In effect, the Federal Court treated contempt as an offence of absolute liability. This error is sufficient to warrant the granting of the appeal: an alleged contemnor\u2019s reasonable efforts (or due diligence, understood broadly) forms part of the evidentiary inquiry into intent. Here, the reasons and factual findings of the Federal Court do not reveal any evidentiary pathway which leads to a conclusion of intent. In fact, the Federal Court\u2019s findings lead to the opposite conclusion\u2014that CP had no intent.\n[31] I note, parenthetically, that absolute liability offences cannot include imprisonment as a potential consequence, as this would offend section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, 1985 CanLII 81 (SCC) at 515). Therefore, as noted by the Federal Court in Canadian Private Copying Collective v. Fuzion Technology Corp., 2009 FC 800, 349 F.T.R. 303 [Fuzion Technology], civil contempt under the Federal Courts Rules, when brought against individuals, cannot constitutionally create an absolute liability offence (at para. 57). This reasoning applies to the offence at large, but not to a corporate defendant, since a corporation cannot be imprisoned; see, e.g., Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, 1989 CanLII 87 (SCC) at 1002. The directing minds, can, however.\nThe mental element of civil contempt\n[32] In criminal contempt, the mens rea rests on the \u201celement of public defiance\u201d, such as flaunting disobedience or disrespect for the authority of the courts (Carey at para. 31). In civil contempt, on the other hand, the alleged contemnor must only have intentionally done the act that breached the order at issue; no element of public defiance is required (Carey at para. 35). In short, criminal contempt requires certain attributes of contumacious intent; civil contempt does not. I note, parenthetically, that the words \u201cmens rea\u201d were not used by Cromwell J. in Carey, likely so as to not confuse the mental elements in civil and criminal contempt.\n[33] In Carey, Cromwell J. was also careful to note that there are two discrete types of intentional acts that can ground a finding of civil contempt; one where the alleged contemnor has \u201cintentionally done the act that the order prohibits\u201d, the other where the alleged contemnor \u201cintentionally failed to do the act that the order compels\u201d (Carey at para. 35, emphasis added). As will be discussed below, the distinction between the two types of actions or orders (whether the action or order is prohibitory or mandatory) is reflected in the jurisprudence of civil contempt and guides its application. (For a further discussion of the difference between the two types of orders see R. v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., 2018 SCC 5, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 196.)\n[34] To summarize, the fact that an order has been breached does not establish the offence. The mental element of intent must still be made out. However, as I will explain, and as the case law demonstrates, depending on the nature of the order and the act that breaches it, the breach of the order itself may provide an evidentiary springboard to support a conclusion on intent.\n[35] Intent in civil contempt, like in many criminal offences, can sometimes be inferred from the contemnor\u2019s conduct, without direct evidence of the contemnor\u2019s state of mind (Viterra at paras. 132-133). Intent in civil contempt can also be satisfied by evidence of deliberateness, recklessness, or wilful blindness (Doucette at para. 30; Fuzion Technology at para. 63; see also Sakab Saudi Holding Company et al. v. Al Jabri et al., 2024 ONSC 1347, 2024 CarswellOnt 3027 at para. 93). I note, parenthetically, that the Federal Court judge found no such conduct on the part of CP and in fact made findings to the contrary. I will return to this point later in these reasons.\n[36] As Carey indicates, the intention analysis may take different shape when dealing with a mandatory order as compared to a prohibitory order.\n[37] Since a prohibitory order requires the person or party to refrain from doing something, when the prohibited act is committed, a compelling inference arises that the person intended to commit the act. Put another way, the nature of the breach or the act itself provides an evidentiary foundation for a finding of intention. This was the type of order at issue in Carey. The contemnor in Carey was subject to an order enjoining him from returning money held in trust to a client. The contemnor nevertheless returned the money. The prohibitory nature of this order allowed the Court to find that he \u201cdecid[ed] to give the money back\u201d and therefore intended the act, without much analysis on the point (Carey at para. 60).\n[38] Similar inferences were drawn in other cases dealing with contempt of prohibitory orders: Bell Canada v. Red Rhino Entertainment Inc., 2019 FC 1460, 161 W.C.B. (2d) 507 at para. 18 [Red Rhino]; Boutin v. Boutin, 2022 ONSC 3229, 2022 W.C.B. 639 at paras. 122-124; XY, LLC v. Canadian Topsires Selection Inc., 2014 BCSC 2629, 124 W.C.B. (2d) 246 at para. 20; Alston v. the Municipal District of Foothills No. 31, 2021 ABQB 951, [2022] A.W.L.D. 3262 at para. 12; and Slater Vecchio LLP v. Arvanitis, 2021 BCSC 428, 172 W.C.B. (2d) 103 at para. 33. In all of these cases, the requirement of intent was satisfied as a logical, evidentiary inference from the commission of the prohibited act. While the onus is on the moving party to establish all three elements of the offence, in cases of prohibitory orders, proof of the actus reus may cause a tactical burden to arise on the part of the defendant.\n[39] Therefore, a finding that the actus reus has been made out for contempt of prohibitory orders will often allow the court to find that the mental element for the offence has also been made out. However, this is not an automatic finding of liability: it is an evidentiary inference that arises from the nature of the order and conduct in question. Intent remains a requirement, but the requirement can be discharged as a matter of evidence. Here, the Federal Court conflated proof of the actus reus with proof of the necessary intent. This was in error. The offence of civil contempt is not, and cannot be, an offence of strict or absolute liability.\n[40] Mandatory orders are different in kind: there are myriad circumstances that might preclude or limit compliance with a mandatory order. The actus reus alone does not, generally, give rise to the same evidentiary inference. The point was made clearly in Doucette at paragraphs 36-37:\nTo use analogies from criminal law, contempt is not an absolute, or even a strict liability offence. [\u2026]\nWhere the contempt alleged is failure to comply with a court order, it is not enough to prove that the respondents were aware of an order and failed to comply. The law is clear that where the complainant is unable to prove the requisite intent beyond a reasonable doubt, the offence is not made out. Where the contempt in question relates to the more common prohibitory order, proof of knowledge and breach of the order may well be sufficient to permit the Court to draw the inference or conclusion that the breach was deliberate or reckless. That same inference is not so easily drawn when the contempt alleged is of a mandatory order. Where an individual or organization is ordered to perform a specific duty or act, a myriad of circumstances might prevent a person or organization from doing what they have been ordered to do. I have concluded above that evidence of frustration of efforts to comply or impossibility of compliance is properly to be considered when deciding whether the alleged contemnor(s) intentionally or deliberately failed to do as ordered.\n[41] In Envacon the Alberta Court of Appeal agreed with the reasoning in Doucette and wrote at paragraphs 36-39:\nWe do not read Carey as changing the law that requires courts to look at reasonable excuse as an aspect of the test for finding contempt. [\u2026] We also reject the suggestion that Carey changed this approach and that reasonable excuse is only to be considered with respect to the penalty after a finding of contempt.\n[\u2026]\nIndeed, Cromwell J, writing for the Court in Carey at para 37, acknowledged that in some cases, an alleged contemnor who tries diligently to obey an order but fails may avoid a finding of contempt (citations omitted and emphasis added):\n[W]here an alleged contemnor acted in good faith in taking reasonable steps to comply with the order, the judge entertaining a contempt motion generally retains some discretion to decline to make a finding of contempt .... While I prefer not to delineate the full scope of this discretion, given that the issue was not argued before us, I wish to leave open the possibility that a judge may properly exercise his or her discretion to decline to impose a contempt finding where it would work an injustice in the circumstances of the case.\nIn such cases, the alleged contemnor in effect has a reasonable excuse for failing to comply. That excuse goes to the finding of contempt, and not to the remedy or penalty.\n[42] Envacon and Doucette articulate the correct analytical pathway to finding the requisite intent in civil contempt. In those cases, the Courts acknowledge that for prohibitory orders, the inference of intent may be readily drawn where proof of knowledge and breach of the order have been made out. For mandatory orders, the analysis includes consideration of factors that may have prevented an alleged contemnor from doing what they had been ordered to do.\n[43] The Federal Court did not distinguish between the types of orders and the implications for how the requirement of intent is fulfilled. To the contrary, the Federal Court took pains to distinguish the cases. The judge found that Envacon did not apply because it was decided under the Alberta Rules of Court, which allow a court to make a finding of contempt where the alleged contemnor has failed to comply with an order \u201cwithout reasonable excuse\u201d. Since no such language appears in the Federal Courts Rules, the judge considered Envacon irrelevant. However, Carey was decided under Ontario law, which also lacks express \u201cwithout reasonable excuse\u201d language, and the Court in Envacon concluded that the words \u201cwithout reasonable excuse\u201d did not create a different test than that described in Carey or efface the requirement for intent.\n[44] It is of no consequence whether an alleged contemnor\u2019s reasonable efforts to comply are considered as tactical \u201cdefences\u201d that can negate a prima facie finding of intent, or as factors to consider in assessing whether or not there is sufficient evidence to find intent beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, reasonable efforts to comply are factors that may allow a court to exercise its discretion to decline to find contempt, despite all factors being made out (as highlighted in Carey at paras. 36-37). I agree with the Alberta Court of Appeal in Envacon that efforts to comply bear on the finding of guilt and are not discretionary factors speaking only to remedy.\n[45] To conclude, the distinction between prohibitory and mandatory orders is important. The distinction guides the analysis of the evidence and how a finding of intent is to be established. However, the point in this appeal is that intent must, in all cases, be found. Here the judge found none, but still entered a conviction for contempt.\nThe findings of the Federal Court\n[46] The burden to prove contempt is always on the party alleging contempt, even where that party attempts to make out its case based on the alleged contemnor\u2019s recklessness or insufficient discipline in implementing a mandatory order. The alleged contemnor is never obliged to put forward any evidence. However, if sufficient evidence is put forward that the order was intentionally or recklessly breached, then the alleged contemnor may tactically wish to bring evidence forward of its diligence or reasonable efforts to avoid the breach (Envacon at paras. 44-45 and 48-50). Teamsters led no evidence of deliberateness, wilful blindness, recklessness or serious indifference on the part of CP, and there is no suggestion in the reasons of the Federal Court that this was the case.\n[47] The Court found the opposite: it noted CP\u2019s \u201csignificant and meaningful steps\u201d towards compliance and noted that the breaches mainly resulted from \u201cerror[s] of judgment\u201d and \u201cbad decisions\u201d (Federal Court decision at paras. 58, 92 and 99). In its sentencing decision, the Federal Court stated that there was \u201cno evidence of deliberate conduct on the part of CP management or employees\u201d and that the breaches of the Award \u201carose as a result of CP operational failures\u201d (Federal Court sentencing decision at para. 25).\n[48] The \u201csignificant and meaningful steps\u201d taken by CP to ensure compliance with the Award included issuing clear communications to the organization regarding its obligations, adopting compliance reporting requirements, generating performance reports, and holding calls with relevant parties to discuss compliance (Federal Court decision at paras. 51 and 58). Additionally, the judge found that many breaches of the Award were occasioned by \u201cbad decisions by inexperienced managers\u201d or \u201cerrors in judgment\u201d. There was no evidence of deliberate conduct, but rather the breaches arose only by reason of operational failures. (Federal Court decision at paras. 92 and 95; Federal Court sentencing decision at para. 25). The Federal Court therefore found no intention on the part of CP\u2019s high-level management, nor on the part of CP\u2019s on-the-ground managers and decision-makers.\n[49] The judge also noted that while CP initially achieved over 99 percent compliance with the Award, CP\u2019s obligation was to continuously manage ongoing compliance (Federal Court decision at paras. 104-106). In other words, any drop in compliance without excuse would be contempt, even in the absence of intent, recklessness or wilful blindness. The judge effectively treated contempt as a strict or absolute liability offence.\n[50] Notwithstanding its findings of fact, the Court nevertheless ruled that CP\u2019s breaches were contemptuous because they were \u201cwithin CP\u2019s control\u201d (Federal Court decision at para. 90). Control does not amount to intent. It is therefore impossible to reconcile the Federal Court\u2019s findings of fact with the legal conclusion reached. While this is sufficient to allow the appeal, I will turn to the second issue, and whether the judge erred in setting aside the directing mind doctrine.\nIntent of corporations in civil contempt\n[51] Ascribing intent to a corporation, especially a large one, is a difficult task. The directing mind doctrine provides a middle ground between vicarious liability (imposing blanket liability on corporations for the criminal acts of their employees acting in the scope of their employment), and criminal liability only attaching to a corporation if its board of directors directs the criminal act (Canadian Dredge at 675 and 692-693).\n[52] The directing mind doctrine has been applied to corporations in the context of civil contempt, usually in the context of closely held corporations: see, for example, Caledon (Town) v. Darzi Holdings Ltd., 2022 ONCA 807, 2022 W.C.B. 1886 at paras. 1-2; College of Optometrists of Ontario v. SHS Optical Ltd., 2006 CanLII 39463 (ONSC), [2006] O.J. No. 4708 at paras. 2 and 19, aff\u2019d 2008 ONCA 685, [2008] O.J. No. 3933; Red Rhino at para. 28; Canadian Standards Association v. P.S. Knight Co. Ltd., 2021 FC 770, 186 C.P.R. (4th) 102 at paras. 58-59 and 66; Roynat Inc. v. 1664092 Ontario Inc., 2014 ONSC 2778, 114 W.C.B. (2d) 286 at paras. 32-33; Peach Films Pty. Ltd. v. Cinemavault Releasing Inc., 2008 CanLII 48815 (ONSC), 79 W.C.B. (2d) 32 at para. 25; and Trans-High Corp. v. Hightimes Smokeshop and Gifts Inc., 2015 FC 919, 134 C.P.R. (4th) 222 at paras. 3 and 6.\n[53] For closely held corporations, intent is simple to establish. The person who committed the act that breached the order will often necessarily be the directing mind of the corporation. In such cases, the intent analysis is typically perfunctory, as a conclusion regarding intention is self-evident from the actions of the senior officers.\n[54] Unsurprisingly, there are few examples of large, publicly held corporations being held in contempt. Nevertheless, the directing mind test still applies, and the judge\u2019s refusal to apply it is unsupported by the jurisprudence.\n[55] The judge relied on Baxter and Tele-Direct to support the contention that there was no directing mind \u201cexemption\u201d available to CP in this case.\n[56] The law of civil contempt itself has evolved significantly since Baxter such that it is no longer good law and ought not to have been followed. Baxter predates Canadian Dredge and predicates its conclusion on liability for contempt on the doctrine of vicarious liability (Baxter at 509). The Court in Baxter also found that \u201cit is no defence [to contempt] for a company to show that its officers were unaware of the terms of a court order\u201d (at 509). However, and to the contrary, Carey holds that knowledge of the order is a mandatory element of contempt (Carey at para. 34).\n[57] The second case relied on by the judge to avoid finding a corporate intent was Tele-Direct. Tele-Direct does not hold that the directing mind doctrine is unavailable to large corporations subject to a contempt allegation. Tele-Direct notes that an injunction enjoins both a corporation and its employees, agents, and all those over whom the corporation exercises control, and that the corporation will be in breach of the injunction if persons acting for it breach the order (at para. 81). However, the simple fact that a corporation is in breach of an order does not speak to whether the corporation can be found in contempt for that breach, given the required mental element in contempt.\n[58] Finally, on a principled basis, failing to recognize the directing mind\u2019s application in the law of civil contempt effectively converts the charge into one of vicarious liability. As the Supreme Court held in Bhatnager v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 217, 1990 CanLII 120 (SCC), \u201cliability in contempt is essentially criminal liability\u201d, and \u201cin general, vicarious liability is unknown to the criminal law\u201d (at 229).\n[59] I close on two cases relied on by Teamsters in support of the judge\u2019s analysis of contempt: Amalgamated Transit Union and Viterra. They are instructive cases, but do not support the argument that a finding of intention was unnecessary. Both involved mandatory orders, but illustrate how evidence of intent can be established in those circumstances.\n[60] In Amalgamated Transit Union, an arbitration award directed that an employee be reinstated. The defendant city had not reinstated the employee, and the Court was able to infer that the non-reinstatement was intentional. Given the simplicity of the order, the length of time that had passed, the city\u2019s control over its implementation and the absence of any intervening factors, the only reasonable inference that could be drawn was that the city did not intend to comply with the order. There was no reasonable possibility that the failure to reinstate the employee was the result of \u201ca slip or a mistake or some sort of oversight\u201d (at para. 31).\n[61] Similarly, in Viterra, Viterra was found in contempt of an order directing that it stop employees from working more than 48 hours per week. The evidence established that employees had been allowed to work, had been paid hours in excess of the proscribed 48 hour maximum and that the corporation had made little or no effort to comply for more than two years. In these circumstances the Court readily inferred that Viterra\u2019s management never intended to comply with the order. To ensure compliance, all Viterra needed to do was tell its employees that they were not permitted to work more than 48 hours and would not be paid for any hours beyond the maximum. Presumably, had that occurred, employees would not have worked more than the maximum hours permitted since they would not be paid. In those circumstances, the breach could not have occurred had Viterra not intended for it to occur.\n[62] Two points arise from these cases; first, in each case, the Court found, as a matter of evidence, that the management of the corporations never intended to comply with the order. Second, the conclusion as to intention arose as a logical evidentiary inference from the factual matrix. The cases bear no resemblance to the facts as found by the judge in this appeal.\n[63] The offence of contempt is an intent-based offence. The Federal Court erred in finding contempt in the absence of a finding of intent on the part of CP. As detailed above, the Federal Court found that CP\u2019s high-level management made significant efforts to comply with the Award (Federal Court decision at paras. 51-58). This ought to have ended the inquiry.\nResidual Issues [64] I conclude by addressing three issues which, while of no consequence in light of my conclusion, nevertheless warrant brief comment.\n[65] The judge made a palpable and overriding error of fact in finding that incidents 31 and 33 were contemptuous. The reasons, read generously and in light of the record, do not allow for the conclusion that incidents 31 and 33 constituted a breach of the Award.\n[66] These incidents were yarding incidents. The judge had acknowledged earlier in her reasons that in order to determine whether a yarding incident was a breach of the Award, it was not sufficient to point to the amount of time on duty: other conditions must be met, including whether CP made arrangements to expedite the yarding of the train, and whether other crews were on duty and available to yard the crew\u2019s train (Federal Court decision at para. 23; Award, Appeal Book at p. 806). The judge declined to find contempt for four other yarding incidents on this basis, noting \u201cinsufficient evidence as to whether the yarding directive outlined in the [] Award was followed\u201d (Federal Court decision at para. 89). The judge does not explain why yarding incidents 31 and 33 were still found to be contemptuous, given this overarching lack of necessary evidence.\n[67] As noted, in light of my conclusion that the appeal should be allowed, this is an error of no consequence.\n[68] The Federal Court\u2019s reasons also do not adequately consider the discretion to find, or not find, contempt.\n[69] Even if all of the criteria in support of a finding of contempt are met, judges retain discretion in finding contempt (Carey at paras. 36-37), and the failure of a court to consider its discretion in exercising its contempt power is an error of law (Chong v. Donnelly, 2019 ONCA 799, [2019] O.J. No. 5048 at para. 12). Here, the Federal Court mentioned its discretion in its reasons (Federal Court decision at paras. 61 and 81-82) but went no further. Reasons cannot simply make note of the correct legal test, then fail to apply it (R v. Chung, 2020 SCC 8, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 405 at para. 13). The judge\u2019s reasoning with respect to discretion was purely conclusory and does not allow this Court to understand why the judge chose to exercise her discretion or not.\n[70] Contempt is a power that must be exercised lightly. It is a remedy of last resort, and it should not be used as a means to enforce judgments (Carey at para. 36). Judges entertaining contempt motions must seriously consider their overriding discretion in light of the purpose of contempt, and all other relevant circumstances, including the behaviour of the contemnor and the nature of the order.\n[71] The third residual issue concerns penalty.\n[72] The Federal Court issued its reasons on the penalty against CP for its contempt in January 2024. The Federal Court imposed a fine of $200,000 on CP and ordered that it be paid to Canada\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital Foundations, on the agreement of the parties (Federal Court sentencing decision at paras. 41-42).\n[73] While the issue was not argued before us, I simply flag my reservation about allowing parties to discharge a contempt violation by making a charitable contribution. While I understand the motivation, the practice arguably effaces both the gravity of the offence and the public opprobrium that is to be reflected by the penalty. To date, the appropriateness of such payments has been discussed in the context of criminal prosecutions and the practice across Canada is not uniform (see the Public Prosecution Service of Canada Deskbook, Part VI, ch. 6.6, \u201cCharitable Donations\u201d, updated November 28, 2017, for a review of the jurisprudence and policy considerations). Nevertheless, even where permitted, a link must exist between the offence and the penalty\u2014a contribution to a conservation organization in consequence of a breach of an environmental regulation, for example. Here, even if it were appropriate to order a payment to a charity, there is no such link between the offence and the penalty.\n[74] Allowing a corporate party to characterize a criminal penalty as a charitable contribution undermines both accountability for the conduct and the principles of general and specific deterrence that underlie sentencing. I make no decision on this, of course, and leave it for another day where the point can be argued in a factual context.\nDisposition\n[75] In light of the judge\u2019s findings of fact there is no basis on which a judge, properly instructed to the law, could find contempt. This Court may make the judgment a trial court should have made based on the evidentiary record as found, or where \u201cthe review required by the grounds of appeal consists of drawing conclusions from facts which are uncontested\u201d (Canada v. Piot, 2019 FCA 53, 437 D.L.R. (4th) 706 at para. 115; Pfizer Canada Inc. v. Teva Canada Limited, 2016 FCA 161, [2016] 4 F.C.R. D-13 at para. 153 [Pfizer]; see also Donald J.M. Brown, Civil Appeals (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, 2009), ch. 6 at 6:19). That is the case here.\n[76] To remit the matter for re-hearing before the Federal Court on the expectation that a different judge might come to a different conclusion on the same evidence would raise concerns ringing of res judicata, issue estoppel and abuse of process. While arising in the context of a criminal appeal, the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in R. Pittiman, 2006 SCC 9, [2006] 1 SCR 381 at para. 14 is apposite:\nWhere a conviction is set aside on the ground that the verdict is unsupported by the evidence, the court of appeal, absent legal errors in respect of the admissibility of evidence, will usually enter an acquittal. As noted by Doherty J.A. in R. v. Harvey (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 52 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 30, \u201c[a]n acquittal is the appropriate order because it would be unfair to order a new trial and give the Crown a second opportunity to present a case on which a reasonable trier of fact could convict.\u201d\n[77] A new trial is often ordered where there has been an error in the admissibility of evidence, such that the jury or judge made a determination on a faulty evidentiary foundation, or where there has been an error in the conduct of the trial itself (Westerhof v. Gee Estate, 2015 ONCA 206, 124 O.R. (3d) 721 at para. 147; see Sopinka, The Conduct of an Appeal, 5th ed., (Toronto: LexisNexis, 2022), at pp. 296-297). A redetermination is often ordered where the case is factually complex, dependent on the testimony of witnesses, and the result is factually suffused and uncertain (Pfizer at para. 157). That is not the case here. The facts are not in issue, and the conduct of the trial is not in issue.\n[78] A new trial or redetermination may also be ordered where there has been a change in the law (Pfizer at para. 160). That is also not the case here. The law did not change; it was misunderstood.\n[79] Intent is a question of fact (Schuldt v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 592, 1985 CanLII 20 (SCC) at 599-600). However, where a trial judge errs as to the legal effect of settled facts, this becomes a question of law and an appellate court can \u201cdisagree with the conclusion reached without trespassing on the fact-finding function of the trial judge\u201d (R. v. Morin, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 286, 1992 CanLII 40 (SCC) at 294). Applying the law to the facts as found by the Federal Court, I would allow the appeal and enter an acquittal. The appellant is entitled to costs in this Court and below.\n\u201cDonald J. Rennie\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nMary J.L. Gleason J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nGeorge R.

ENTERTAINMENT INC.\nRespondents\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\n(Delivered from the Bench at Ottawa, Ontario, on September 3, 2024).\nGOYETTE J.A.\n[1] On a motion to review the execution of an Anton Piller Order [Order], the Federal Court determined that the Order was lawfully executed against the appellants: 2022 FC 1602. The appellants appeal this decision. They also appeal the costs order issued by the Federal Court in the context of the review proceeding: Bell Media Inc. et al. v. Macciacchera (Smoothstreams.tv) et al. (28 December 2022), T-1257-22 (FC) [Costs Decision].\n[2] The appellants do not challenge the lawfulness of the Order. Rather, they argue that the execution of the Order was unlawful because of (a) its duration, (b) the asking of improper questions to the appellants, and (c) the failure to properly explain and abide by health and safety precautions. The Federal Court found that the terms of the Order and the evidence before it do not support these arguments. The appellants acknowledge that these findings are reviewable on a palpable and overriding error standard: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 at paras. 8, 26\u201337. We see no such error.\n[3] In this Court, the appellants further argue that the Federal Court committed an error of law reviewable on correctness. They identify this error as the Federal Court\u2019s failure to take into account the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11 [Charter]) and the Charter values in reviewing the terms of the Order and the manner in which it was executed. In this regard, the appellants say that the execution of the Order violated the rights protected by sections 7, 8, and 9 of the Charter, that is, the right to life, liberty and security, the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.\n[4] This Charter argument fails for two reasons.\n[5] First, the appellants cannot ground their appeal upon a Charter right. This is because the Charter does not apply between private parties, and Charter rights do not exist in the absence of state action: Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto, [1995] 2 SCR 1130 at para. 95 [Hill]; RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 SCR 573 at p. 599; Tremblay v. Daigle, [1989] 2 SCR 530 at p. 571. The execution of an Anton Piller order does not involve state action; the order \u201cis not placed in the hands of a public authority for execution\u201d: Celanese Canada Inc. v. Murray Demolition Corp., 2006 SCC 36 at para. 1 [Celanese]. Rather, as in this case, an Anton Piller order \u201cauthorizes a private party to insist on entrance to the premises of its opponent to conduct a surprise search, the purpose of which is to seize and preserve evidence to further its claim in a private dispute\u201d: Celanese at para. 1 (emphasis added); see also Ontario Realty Corp. v. P. Gabriele & Sons Ltd., 2000 CanLII 22697 (ON SC) at para. 34; Viacom Ha! Holding Co. v. Jane Doe, [2000] F.C.J. No. 498 at paras. 80\u201381.\n[6] Second, in the absence of an explanation as to how the execution of the Order was inconsistent with Charter values, this argument cannot be entertained: Hill at para. 95; Singh Brar v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2024 FCA 114 at para. 66.\n[7] We respect to the Costs Decision, Rule 400(1) of the Federal Court Rules (SOR\/98-106) gives the Federal Court \u201cfull discretionary power over the amount and allocation of costs.\u201d In the absence of a question of law, the standard of review on appeal of a discretionary decision on costs is that of palpable and overriding error: Nova Chemicals Corporation v. Dow Chemical Company, 2017 FCA 25 at para. 6. Again, we find no such error in the Costs Decision.\n[8] Given the foregoing, the appeals will be dismissed with costs.\n\u201c Nathalie Goyette \u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDocket:\nA-262-22 A-2-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMARSHALL MACCIACCHERA dba SMOOTHSTREAMS.TV, ANTONIO MACCIACCHERA dba SMOOTHSTREAMS.TV, ARM HOSTING INC., STAR HOSTING LIMITED (HONG KONG), ROMA WORKS LIMITED (HONG KONG) and ROMA WORKS SA (PANAMA) v.

The Motion Judge found that the appellant\u2019s motion to amend its Amended Statement of Claim in a copyright infringement action was not in the interests of justice. The Judge also dismissed the appellant\u2019s request for an adjournment.\n[2] In this case, the standard of review is that of palpable and overriding error for questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law, and of correctness for questions of law (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at paras. 8, 10 and 36).\n[3] Essentially, the appellant contends that the Motion Judge made multiple errors of law and palpable and overriding errors.\n[4] We disagree.\n[5] The Motion judge identified the correct legal test developed by the jurisprudence to be applied on a motion for leave to amend and to adjourn pursuant to Rules 75 and 76 of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106. The Motion Judge considered the relevant factors in the circumstances of this case, properly weighed the evidence and provided a thorough analysis. We find no basis for the argument that the Motion Judge erred in law or made palpable and overriding errors.\n[6] For these reasons, the appeal will be dismissed with costs.\n\"Richard Boivin\"\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-206-24\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nGE RENEWABLE ENERGY CANADA INC. v.

Canada (Environment and Climate Change), 2023 FC 1511 (per Furlanetto J.). They seek a stay until 60 days following the disposition of their appeal from the Federal Court\u2019s judgment. In the judgment in question, the Federal Court quashed and declared retroactively invalid and unlawful as of April 23, 2021 the Order Adding a Toxic Substance to Schedule 1 to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, registered on April 23, 2021, and published on May 12, 2021, in the Canada Gazette Part II, Vol. 155, Number 10 (the Order).\n[2] The Order added plastic manufactured items (PMI) to the List of Toxic Substances in Schedule 1 to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, S.C. 1999, c. 33 (CEPA).\n[3] Section 90 of CEPA (as it read on April 23, 2021) delegates to the Governor in Council the authority to add substances to Schedule 1 to CEPA. It provided:\nAddition to List of Toxic Substances\nInscription sur la liste des substances toxiques\n\u25cf 90 (1) Subject to subsection (3), the Governor in Council may, if satisfied that a substance is toxic, on the recommendation of the Ministers, make an order adding the substance to the List of Toxic Substances in Schedule 1.\n\u25cf 90 (1) S\u2019il est convaincu qu\u2019une substance est toxique, le gouverneur en conseil peut prendre, sur recommandation des ministres, un d\u00e9cret d\u2019inscription de la substance sur la liste de l\u2019annexe 1.\n\u25cf Priority\n\u25cf Priorit\u00e9\n(1.1) In developing proposed regulations or instruments respecting preventive or control actions in relation to substances specified on the List of Toxic Substances in Schedule 1, the Ministers shall give priority to pollution prevention actions.\n(1.1) Lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00e9tablir des projets de textes \u2014 r\u00e8glements ou autres \u2014 portant sur les mesures de pr\u00e9vention ou de contr\u00f4le relatives \u00e0 des substances inscrites sur la liste de l\u2019annexe 1, les ministres donnent priorit\u00e9 aux mesures de pr\u00e9vention de la pollution.\n\u25cf Deletion from List\n\u25cf Radiation de la liste\n(2) Subject to subsection (3), the Governor in Council may, if satisfied that the inclusion of a substance specified on the List of Toxic Substances in Schedule 1 is no longer necessary, on the recommendation of the Ministers, make an order\n(2) S\u2019il est convaincu qu\u2019une substance n\u2019a plus \u00e0 figurer sur la liste de l\u2019annexe 1, le gouverneur en conseil peut, sur recommandation des ministres et par d\u00e9cret :\n\u25cb (a) deleting the substance from the List and deleting the type of regulations specified in the List as being applicable with respect to the substance; and\n\u25cb a) radier de la liste la substance et la mention du type de r\u00e8glements aff\u00e9rents;\n\u25cb (b) repealing the regulations made under section 93 with respect to the substance.\n\u25cb b) abroger les r\u00e8glements pris en application de l\u2019article 93.\n\u25cf Order subject to conditions\n\u25cf R\u00e9serve\n(3) Where a board of review is established under section 333 in relation to a substance, no order may be made under subsection (1) or (2) in relation to the substance until the board\u2019s report is received by the Ministers.\n(3) La prise des d\u00e9crets vis\u00e9s aux paragraphes (1) ou (2) est toutefois subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception par les ministres du rapport de la commission de r\u00e9vision \u00e9ventuellement constitu\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 333.\n[4] By virtue of this provision, substances may be added to the list in Schedule 1 to CEPA if the Governor in Council is satisfied that they are toxic.\n[5] In the judgment under appeal, the Federal Court held that the Order was both unreasonable and unconstitutional because the Governor in Council \u201ccould not have been satisfied\u201d that all PMIs are toxic (at paras. 116 and 184).\n[6] It is common ground between the parties that the Order enabled the promulgation of a subsequent regulation, the Single-use Plastics Prohibition Regulations, SOR\/2022-138 (the Single-use Regulations).\n[7] As of the date of these Reasons, several provisions in the Single-use Regulations have come into force. These provisions prohibit, in the circumstances detailed in them, the manufacture and import for sale in Canada of a number of single-use plastic items. These include certain types of: single-use plastic ring carriers, single-use plastic straws, plastic checkout bags, single-use plastic cutlery, single-use plastic foodservice ware, and single-use plastic stir sticks. In addition, the Single-use Regulations prohibit the sale in Canada as of December 20, 2023 of certain: plastic checkout bags, single-use plastic cutlery, single-use plastic foodservice ware, single-use plastic stir sticks, and single-use plastic straws.\n[8] The Regulatory Impact Statement (RIAS) that accompanied the Single-use Regulations explains that the prohibited items are the most prevalent items contributing to plastic pollution and that it is estimated that the Single-use Regulations will result in a net decrease of approximately 1.3 million tonnes of plastic waste in Canada over 10 years. This represents approximately 3% of the plastic waste in the country and 5% of the total plastic pollution in Canada.\n[9] It is clear from the materials filed by the appellants, which include the mandate letters issued to two successive Ministers of the Environment and Climate Change, that banning the use of harmful single-use plastics and taking steps toward eliminating plastic pollution in Canada were and are important objectives of the federal government.\n[10] Based on the evidence filed by the appellants in support of their stay motion, it appears that Environment and Climate Change Canada has spent over $1.5 million in the 2022-2023 fiscal year and had planned spending of over $3.3 million in the 2023-2024 fiscal year to implement the Single-use Regulations. Activities undertaken include meeting with businesses and industry associations, publishing news releases, conducting social media campaigns, completing design work for compliance materials, conducting campaigns with regulatees, developing and delivering training to enforcement officers, and responding to enforcement referrals.\n[11] According to the same evidence, as of December 8, 2023 (the date the appellants\u2019 supporting affidavit was sworn), many businesses have switched to alternatives to the single-use plastics that then were or would be prohibited by the Single-use Regulations. It is to be anticipated that many more businesses have made or are in the process of making the switch as several prohibitions came into force on December 20, 2023 or will come into force on June 20, 2024.\n[12] The Single-use Regulations are being challenged in an application that is currently pending before the Federal Court in Court File T-1468-22. While the parties to that application have agreed that it should be stayed, pending the disposition of this appeal, the Federal Court has not issued a stay order. Moreover, as the appellants note in their submissions, another party could commence a similar application in the Federal Court at any point.\n[13] With this background in mind, I turn now to more specifically address the appellants\u2019 stay application.\n[14] The test for the grant of a stay in a case like this is well-known and requires the moving party to establish that: (1) their appeal raises a serious issue; (2) they would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; and (3) the balance of convenience favours granting the stay: RJR-Macdonald Inc v. Canada (Attorney General), 1994 CanLII 117 (SCC), [1994] 1 SCR 311 at 334 (RJR-MacDonald); Canada v. Canadian Council for Refugees, 2008 FCA 40 at para. 18 (Canadian Council for Refugees).\n[15] The threshold for establishing the first criterion of a serious issue is generally a low one. It will be met in a case like the present if the issues raised in the Notice of Appeal are not frivolous: RJR-Macdonald at 348; Canadian Council for Refugees at paras. 18, 22.\n[16] Here, I am satisfied that the Notice of Appeal raises many such issues. This is especially so when one recalls that the applicable standard of review will require this Court to effectively step into the shoes of the Federal Court, to re-conduct the reasonableness analysis, and to decide if it erred in law in its constitutional analysis. Thus, the first criterion for the issuance of the requested stay is met.\n[17] I am also of the view that the second and third criteria are met in this case.\n[18] The case law recognizes that, where the grant or refusal of a stay would suspend legislation, regulations or other promulgations, the public interest is engaged and is considered as part of both the second and third criteria for the issuance of a stay: RJR MacDonald at 348; Canadian Council for Refugees at para. 24.\n[19] The public interest, moreover, is to be widely-construed. As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada at page 346 of RJR MacDonald, in the context of a request to stay the effect of legislation that was alleged to violate the Charter:\n\u2026 the concept of inconvenience should be widely construed in Charter cases. In the case of a public authority, the onus of demonstrating irreparable harm to the public interest is less than that of a private applicant. This is partly a function of the nature of the public authority and partly a function of the action sought to be enjoined. The test will nearly always be satisfied simply upon proof that the authority is charged with the duty of promoting or protecting the public interest and upon some indication that the impugned legislation, regulation, or activity was undertaken pursuant to that responsibility. Once these minimal requirements have been met, the court should in most cases assume that irreparable harm to the public interest would result from the restraint of that action.\nA court should not, as a general rule, attempt to ascertain whether actual harm would result from the restraint sought. To do so would in effect require judicial inquiry into whether the government is governing well, since it implies the possibility that the government action does not have the effect of promoting the public interest and that the restraint of the action would therefore not harm the public interest.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[20] Contrary to what the respondents assert, these principles have been applied to stay cases outside the Charter context. For example, the Quebec Court of Appeal, in a division of powers case, refused a stay where the effect of granting it would have been to suspend legislation in Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2013 QCCA 1263 at para. 50.\n[21] Here, the appellants have established that the promulgation of the Order and enactment of the subsequent Single-use Regulations were undertaken pursuant to the federal government\u2019s responsibility to act in the public interest as that concept has been defined by the case law.\n[22] Moreover, the linkage between the Order and the Single-use Regulations is evident. While the appellants do not concede that the Federal Court\u2019s judgment means that the Single-use Regulations are invalid, they nonetheless recognize that the Order enabled the enactment of the Single-use Regulations.\n[23] Such enablement is evident. Subsection 93(1) of CEPA ties the Governor in Council\u2019s delegated authority to promulgate regulations under CEPA to substances having been listed in Schedule 1 of CEPA. At the relevant time, subsection 93(1) of CEPA provided:\nRegulations\nR\u00e8glements\n\u25cf 93(1) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the Governor in Council may, on the recommendation of the Ministers, make regulations with respect to a substance specified on the List of Toxic Substances in Schedule 1, including regulations providing for, or imposing requirements respecting,\n\u25cf 93(1) Sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (3) et (4), le gouverneur en conseil peut, sur recommandation des ministres, prendre des r\u00e8glements concernant une substance inscrite sur la liste de

the Federal Court on the effect of subsequent legislation that added PMIs to Schedule 1 of CEPA and that this motion consequently should be dismissed.\n[25] Subsequent to the passage of the Single-use Regulations, Parliament adopted legislation that also itself added PMIs to Schedule 1 of CEPA, namely, the Strengthening Environmental Protection for a Healthier Canada Act, S.C. 2023, c. 12 (Bill S-5). The respondents argue that, in seeking the present stay, the appellants take a position that is inconsistent with their assertion before the Federal Court that Bill S-5 rendered the application to strike the Order moot. They say that, for this reason among others, this stay motion should be refused.\n[26] With respect, I disagree. In its Reasons for Judgment issued in this matter, the Federal Court held at paragraph 32 that the adoption of Bill S-5 did not render the respondents\u2019 motion to strike the Order moot because:\n\u2026the logical inference from the transposition of the complete List of Toxic Substances from Schedule 1 under CEPA to Schedule 1 enacted by Bill S-5 is that PMI would not be listed on the new Schedule 1 if it were not listed on [the original] Schedule 1 of the List of Toxic Substances.\n[27] I express no opinion on whether the Federal Court erred in this regard. What is certain, though, is that its decision has cast doubt on the validity of the Single-use Regulations and the effect of Bill S-5 on the validity of those regulations, which may well cause considerable confusion in the country.\n[28] Given the number of parties impacted by the Single-use Regulations, the recent coming into force of many of the prohibitions in them, and the case law that favours the grant of a stay pending appeal in circumstances where legislation, regulations, or other promulgation would be rendered inoperative, I find that the second and third steps of the test for the grant of a stay are met in this case. In short, if the stay were refused, irreparable harm would be done to the orderly roll-out of the Single-use Regulations and considerable confusion would arise for the many businesses that have moved to comply with their provisions. This would not be in the public interest, which has been found by binding case law to exist when there is some indication that the impugned legislation, regulation, or activity was undertaken by a body charged with acting in the public interest. The Governor in Council, who promulgated the Order, is the highest federal executive authority and is charged with so acting.\n[29] Thus, a stay will be granted. However, it will not be for the full duration requested by the appellants.\n[30] The appellants have requested that the stay should run until 60 days following the disposition of their appeal from the Federal Court\u2019s judgment. I believe it is appropriate that this interim stay should instead extend only to the date of such disposition. If the appellants wish a longer stay, they should make a request for it in their memorandum of fact and law and oral argument. It is a matter for the panel hearing the appeal to decide if the stay should be extended past the date on which this Court renders judgment on the appellants\u2019 appeal. I note, parenthetically, that no extension of this stay would be required if the appellants are successful in their appeal.\n[31] The respondents have requested that, if the stay is granted, the appeal be expedited. I agree that this is appropriate.\n[32] The parties shall forthwith confer to see if they can agree to a timeline for the completion of the steps required to perfect this appeal, with a view to its being heard by no later than June 7, 2024. They shall submit to the Court their agreed schedule or, failing agreement, their respective proposed timelines within 7 days. The matter shall thereafter be returned forthwith to the undersigned to make the required order to set the schedule.\n\"Mary J.L.

Deeproot Green Infrastructure, LLC, 2023 FCA 184 (the Judgment), to change the disposition to allow the appeal as opposed to dismissing it.\n[2] For the reasons that follow, this motion will be dismissed, with costs.\n[3] The appellant says that this Court failed to deal with its arguments on overbreadth in its Reasons for Judgment. It claims that, had these arguments been addressed, the appeal would have been allowed due to the lack of an upper limit to the term \u201cat least approximately 85%\u201d soil volume in Claim 1 in Canadian Patents 2,552,348 and 2,829,599 (collectively, the Patents). In its view, this lack of an upper limit renders the claims invalid for overbreadth since they include 100% soil volume, which is impossible.\n[4] There is no merit to the appellant\u2019s assertions in this regard. There are also several reasons why this motion should be dismissed.\n[5] First, the appellant\u2019s motion was brought well outside the applicable ten-day time limit provided in Rule 397(1) of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106 (Federal Courts Rules).\n[6] Although Rule 8 of the Federal Courts Rules allows the Court to extend the time limits provided in the Rules, such an extension is not appropriate here. The case law establishes that extensions may be granted in circumstances where the party seeking the extension shows that granting it is in the interests of justice. The relevant circumstances to establish this include whether: (1) the party had a continuing intention to pursue the matter, which commenced before the relevant time limit expired; (2) there is a reasonable explanation for the delay; (3) there is some merit to the party\u2019s application; and (4) there is no prejudice to the opposite party: Rafique v. Canada (National Revenue) 2023 FCA 112, 2023 A.C.W.S. 2239 at paras. 2-3; Canada (Attorney General) v. Larkman, 2012 FCA 204, [2012] 4 C.N.L.R. 87 at paras. 61 and 62; Canada (Attorney General) v. Hennelly, [1999] F.C.J. No. 846, 224 N.R. 399 at para. 3.\n[7] Here, the appellant says that it delayed in bringing its motion to vary the Judgment because the matter was complex and it wanted to settle the issue before seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. Neither assertion holds weight.\n[8] There is no evidence that the appellant formed an intention to bring this motion within the relevant ten-day time limit or, indeed, at any time before it prepared the motion materials. Thus, it fails to meet the first criterion for the requested extension. While this is a sufficient basis for dismissing this motion, we briefly set out additional reasons why it should be dismissed.\n[9] The appellant also does not meet the second criterion for the extension of time because its explanation for the delay in bringing this motion is not reasonable. The appellant was represented by experienced counsel, who should have easily been able to grasp within the required ten days whether an issue was unaddressed by the Court, had this been the case. Moreover, there is no rational connection between the deadline for seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and the deadline to bring a Rule 397 motion.\n[10] Likewise, the third criterion for the extension is absent because there is no merit to the appellant\u2019s claims.\n[11] The Court did deal with the appellant\u2019s overbreadth arguments that the claims were broader than the invention made, as the appellant eventually conceded in paragraphs 4 to 6 of its reply submissions on this motion. These were the bulk \u2013 if not the totality \u2013 of the appellant\u2019s submissions on the point to this Court.\n[12] The appellant now says that, in addition to asserting that the claims were broader than the invention made (which raises a factual issue), it also alleged that the claims were overbroad because they disclose an error of construction (and thus a question of law).\n[13] This argument is without merit as, reading the Patents with a mind willing to understand, as the Court must do, an upper limit sufficient to allow for the structure of the cell must be understood to be part of Claim 1 in the two Patents. As the respondents rightly note, a patent is not invalid merely because it leaves open to the skilled person to avoid known unsuitable choices: Burton Parsons Chemicals, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard (Canada) Ltd. (1974), [1976] 1 S.C.R. 555 at 565-566, 54 D.L.R. (3d) 711 at 717-718; AFD Petroleum Ltd. v. Frac Shack Inc., 2018 FCA 140, 295 A.C.W.S. (3d) 840 at para. 57.\n[14] This motion will accordingly be dismissed, with costs.\n\"Mary J.L. Gleason\"\nJ.A.\n\"Judith Woods\"\nJ.A.\n\"Anne L.

Overview\n[1] Jessie Waldron, a survivor class member under the Indian Day Schools Settlement Agreement (IDSSA), appeals from an order of the supervising judge (McLean v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FC 987, Phelan J.). In his order, the supervising judge dismissed Ms. Waldron\u2019s motion to require the claims administrator under the IDSSA to consider the further documentation of abuse she submitted following the filing of her original claim for compensation, and to increase the level of compensation to which she is entitled. Her motion also sought a declaration recognizing a similar entitlement on the part of other members of the survivor class.\n[2] The supervising judge determined that the individual relief Ms. Waldron claimed was not available under the IDSSA, and that she was seeking in effect to have the Court amend the agreement\u2014something it had no jurisdiction to do. He also held that Ms. Waldron, as a class member and not a representative plaintiff, had no entitlement to seek relief on behalf of the class.\n[3] I sympathize with Ms. Waldron\u2019s position. However, for the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.\nII. Background A. The IDSSA [4] The underlying action was certified as a class action in 2018, on consent. As certified, the action alleged among other things that in its operation of Indian day schools, Canada breached fiduciary, constitutional, statutory, and common law obligations owed to survivors of the school system, and that it infringed their Aboriginal rights.\n[5] Settlement negotiations took place over 17 days during the period August to December 2018. The parties reached a settlement in principle in November 2018 and a settlement in March 2019. The settlement was documented in the IDSSA. Recital G to the IDSSA states:\nThe parties intend there to be a fair, comprehensive and lasting settlement of claims related to Indian Day Schools, and further desire the promotion of healing, education, commemoration, and reconciliation. They have negotiated this Settlement Agreement with these objectives in mind.\n[6] Among the benefits the IDSSA provides is individual compensation to Indian day school survivors. Further details concerning the compensation payable and the claims process are set out below beginning at paragraph 15.\n[7] In addition to a claims process for survivor class members, the IDSSA provides for the establishment of a $200 million legacy fund, which the parties agreed would support legacy projects contributing to truth, healing, and reconciliation. The IDSSA states that it is intended that both survivor class members and family class members (spouses, former spouses, children, grandchildren, and siblings of survivor class members) benefit from these projects.\n[8] The IDSSA contains (in section 1.12) a release in favour of Canada. It also contains an \u201centire agreement\u201d clause (in section 1.13), and states (in section 14.02) that except as expressly provided, no amendment may be made to the agreement unless agreed to by the parties\u2014that is, the representative plaintiffs and the Attorney General\u2014in writing and approved by the Federal Court.\n[9] In August 2019, after a three-day settlement approval hearing in May 2019 (about which more will be said later in these reasons), the supervising judge approved the IDSSA, including the claims process and a draft claim form. In giving his approval, he described the IDSSA (McLean v. Canada, 2019 FC 1075 at para. 1) as \u201cthe culmination of litigation concerning tragic, scarring events in the lives of those who attended Indian Day Schools. These events include mockery, belittlement, and physical, sexual, cultural and emotional abuse, which are soul damaging.\u201d He recognized that \u201c[h]ealing will be a long-term process at best.\u201d\n[10] The settlement approval order described the settlement as \u201cfair, reasonable and in the best interests of the Plaintiffs and the Class Members\u201d (McLean v. Canada, 2019 FC 1074 at para. 2). In his reasons for granting the settlement approval order (2019 FC 1075 at para. 145), the supervising judge similarly concluded that the settlement agreement was \u201cfair and reasonable and in the best interests of the Class as a whole.\u201d\n[11] The approval order expressly incorporated the IDSSA, and required that it be implemented in accordance with the approval order and further orders of the Court (2019 FC 1074 at para. 3). The order addressed the further role of the Court in the following terms (2019 FC 1074 at para. 9):\nThis Court, without in any way affecting the finality of this Order, reserves exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over this action, the Plaintiffs, all Class Members who have not opted out of the Settlement Agreement, and the Defendant for the limited purposes of implementing the Settlement Agreement and enforcing and administering the Settlement Agreement and this Order.\n[12] No appeal was brought from the approval order by any party entitled to appeal.\n[13] A class member did bring a motion to this Court under rule 334.31(2) of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.98\/106, for leave to exercise the right of appeal of the representative plaintiffs. The motion was heard by Rivoalen J.A. (as she then was) and dismissed: Ottawa v. McLean, 2019 FCA 309.\n[14] In dismissing the motion, she agreed (at paras. 19-21) with the statement of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Bancroft\u2011Snell v. Visa Canada Corporation, 2019 ONCA 822 at para. 22, leave to appeal refused, 2020 CanLII 23634 (SCC) and 2020 CanLII 23637 (SCC), that \u201c[t]here are sound policy reasons why class members should not be entitled to appeal a settlement order where the representative plaintiff declines to do so.\u201d She was also (at para. 22) \u201cnot satisfied that the appeal itself [was] in the best interests of the Class.\u201d\nB. Compensation payable to survivor class members [15] Under the IDSSA, compensation is available to survivor class members who experienced harm associated with attending an Indian day school during the class period (which runs from January 1, 1920 to the date of closure or transfer from Canada of the particular school). The amount of compensation to which a claimant is entitled is based on a grid, or levels of harm, established following an analysis of damage awards in analogous cases.\n[16] There are five levels on the grid, from the lowest, level 1, to the highest, level 5. The higher the level, the more serious is the sexual or physical abuse and resulting harm required to establish a claim, and the greater is the amount of compensation payable if the claim is established\u2014from $10,000 for a level 1 claim to $50,000, $100,000, $150,000, and $200,000 respectively for claims at levels 2, 3, 4, and 5.\nC. The claims process [17] In his reasons for granting settlement approval, the supervising judge described the claims process under the IDSSA (2019 FC 1075 at para. 43) as \u201cbased on a simple claim form on which claimants self identify a single level of compensation.\u201d\n[18] The IDSSA called for the process to be administered by a claims administrator appointed by the Federal Court on the recommendation of the parties. The settlement approval order appointed Deloitte as claims administrator. The order described the claims administrator\u2019s role as follows (2019 FC 1074 at para. 11):\nSubject to the Court\u2019s ongoing supervision and orders, the Claims Administrator will develop, install and implement systems, forms, information, guidelines and procedures for processing and making decisions on Claim Applications in accordance with the Settlement Agreement and will develop, install and implement systems and procedures for making payments of compensation in accordance with the Settlement Agreement.\n[19] Section 9.03 of the IDSSA is entitled \u201cPrinciples Governing Claims Administration\u201d. The principles it enumerates include the following.\nThe Claims Process is intended to be expeditious, cost-effective, user-friendly and culturally sensitive.\nThe intent is to minimize the burden on the Claimants in pursuing their Claims and to mitigate any likelihood of re-traumatization through the Claims Process.\nThe Claims Administrator [\u2026] shall, in the absence of reasonable grounds to the contrary, assume that a Claimant is acting honestly and in good faith.\nIn considering an Application, the Claims Administrator [\u2026] shall draw all reasonable and favourable inferences that can be drawn in favour of the Claimant, as well as resolving any doubt as to whether a Claim has been established in favour of the Claimant.\n[20] According to the partner of Deloitte who manages its engagement as claims administrator, Deloitte designed the claims process on the basis that claimants would submit one claim form for processing and adjudication, and that \u201cprogressive disclosure\u201d\u2014the ability for claimants at the intake stage to change their self-identified level of harm or add narrative or further documents to their claim form once submitted\u2014was not to be part of the process.\n[21] Sections 9 and 10 of the IDSSA, together with Schedule B, set out further particulars of the claims process and the role of the claims administrator. The IDSSA provides two and a half years for Class Members to file their claims. It also provides for both emotional and legal support to class members in the claims process through the office of the claims administrator, class counsel (whose services are free to class members), or counsel of the class member\u2019s choosing.\n[22] The claims administrator\u2019s determination of whether a claimant is entitled to compensation, and if so at what level, is to be based on the information provided in the claim form, the final version of which was also approved by the supervising judge. A decision of the claims administrator is final and binding on the claimant without any recourse or appeal, except as set out in the claims process.\n[23] The claim form sets out descriptions of harm corresponding to each of the five levels. Claimants are to describe their experience at an Indian day school by reference to these descriptions and self-identify the level of compensation they are claiming, corresponding to the most serious harm they claim to have suffered. Claimants are also to provide supporting documentation, the nature of which depends on the level of compensation claimed. Claimants may, in the alternative, submit a declaration that they do not have access to the required documentation.\n[24] According to the approved claims process, the claims administrator, after reviewing a claim form, is to send one of three acknowledgment letters to the claimant: a letter confirming the claimant\u2019s eligibility as a class member; a letter denying the claimant\u2019s eligibility as a class member; or a letter requesting additional information (such as a missing signature or copy of a document) to determine the claimant\u2019s eligibility as a class member.\n[25] As noted above, level 1 is the lowest level of claim. To meet the requirements for a level 1 claim, the claimant need only allege verbal abuse or physical abuse, \u201cincluding but not limited to culturally unreasonable or disproportionate acts of discipline or punishment.\u201d The claim form instructs claimants to select level 1, and place a mark in the corresponding box, if that description \u201crepresents the most serious abuse\/harm that [the claimant] experienced.\u201d It states that if the claimant selects level 1, \u201cno further description is required.\u201d\n[26] Canada is to pay $1.27 billion (and up to $1.4 billion if required) to fund the payment of level 1 claims, and has no right to be informed of or object to claims at that level.\n[27] As the self-identified level of claim increases from level 2 to level 5, claimants must disclose increasingly more serious physical and\/or sexual abuse to establish their claims. These claims can be supported by disclosing physical or mental impairment over time that is linked to abuse.\n[28] The claim form instructs claimants to identify the abuse or harm they suffered by reference to the descriptions of level 2 to 5 abuse or harm set out in the grid. They are then instructed to \u201cSelect [their] Claim Level, by placing a mark in one box below, for the Level of abuse\/harm [they] suffered as identified above [on the form].\u201d Beside four boxes, one for each level from 2 to 5 and the corresponding compensation level, the form then states, \u201cPlace a MARK in ONE box\u201d (emphasis in original). The claim form contains no provision for making multiple claims or for changing the level of a claim once selected.\n[29] Canada has the right to provide the claims administrator with supplemental information regarding eligibility for compensation at levels 2 to 5. It is to transfer funds directly to the claims administrator as necessary to provide for payment of claims at these levels.\n[30] If the claims administrator determines that a claim meets or exceeds the criteria for a class member\u2019s selected level, payment is processed at the level assessed by the claims administrator. If the claims administrator is of the view that the claim does not meet the criteria for the self-identified level, it must notify the class member and provide brief reasons for this conclusion. The class member then has the right to have the claim reconsidered, and may submit a response to the claim administrator\u2019s reasons and provide additional information.\n[31] If, despite the response and the additional information provided, the claims administrator remains of the view that the class member is eligible for compensation only at a level below the self-identified level, the class member has a right of review by a third party assessor. The third party assessor may invite the class member to provide more information, including by means of a video recording of the class member\u2019s evidence.\n[32] The claims process expressly contemplates in only two circumstances the possibility that survivor class members may submit additional documentation in support of their filed claims: (1) in response to an acknowledgment letter from the claims administrator requesting missing information (such as a signature or a copy of personal identification) or (2) in the course of reconsideration or third party review of a claim made at one of levels 2 to 5. According to the claims administrator, it would also consider missing information submitted by a claimant where the claimant identified the omission to provide missing information before the claims administrator requested it. Beyond these limited circumstances, there is nothing in the claims process that could be considered provision for progressive disclosure.\nD. Implementation of the claims process [33] The supervising judge approved the amended claim form on January 7, 2020. Implementation of the claims process began shortly afterwards, on January 13, 2020. The claims deadline, which was specified as two years and six months after settlement implementation, was therefore July 13, 2022. As of May 2021, the claims administrator had received 111,642 claims from an estimated class of 140,000, and had adjudicated and paid some 72,000 claims. Some 90% of the paid claims were at level 1.\n[34] The claims administrator proceeded on the basis that under the court-approved claims process, progressive disclosure was not permitted. However, two sets of difficulties arose in the early stages of implementing the claims process.\n[35] First, the claims administrator observed that claimants were submitting multiple claim forms through different methods of delivery, with additional narratives, additional support documents, and altered claim levels. In the first 78 days of the claims period, from January 13, 2020 to March 31, 2020, the claims administrator received 40% more written submissions than claims\u201441,171 submissions related to 29,199 claims. This required the claims administrator to spend significant time on measures to ensure there were no duplicate claims or double payments.\n[36] In early February 2020, the claims administrator advised the parties of this situation. Following consultation with the parties, the claims administrator provided what it described as a \u201ctemporary allowance or exception\u201d, by which claimants would be permitted to increase the level of their claim as long as the claim had not yet been adjudicated or paid.\n[37] Second, the COVID-19 pandemic created further complications. Because government offices were ordered to be closed, claimants had difficulties in obtaining supporting documents. In addition, employees of the claims administrator could not attend at their offices to process claims, and the claims administrator could not determine the date that claim forms were received. Where claimants had submitted multiple claims, the claims administrator could not determine which version was the first. The temporary allowance also addressed these issues.\n[38] Court approval was not sought for the temporary allowance.\n[39] On May 27, 2020, after further consultation and agreement with the parties, the claims administrator informed the parties that the temporary allowance would end. It set June 15, 2020 as the last day for claimants either to submit additional information or to declare they would be doing so. Public notice of the date was disseminated via Facebook, the Federal Indian Day School Class Action website, and the claims administrator\u2019s website.\nE. Ms. Waldron\u2019s claims [40] Ms. Waldron is a survivor of an Indian day school, the Waterhen Indian Day School in Saskatchewan. She gave evidence that once she learned of the IDSSA, she attempted to obtain information about the process of making a claim, and help in doing so and in disclosing the abuse that she experienced. She stated that she did not think she was just a level 1 claimant, but wanted to be sure.\n[41] However, she stated, her efforts to obtain information and assistance were largely unsuccessful. She therefore filed a level 1 claim, in June 2020. She deposed that she \u201cwas so fed up and just wanted to get it over with,\u201d and that she filed a claim at level 1 \u201cout of confusion and frustration.\u201d\n[42] In September 2020, a law firm representing Ms. Waldron filed another claim on her behalf, outlining abuses at levels 3 and 4. Later that month, the claims administrator advised that it would not accept the new claim form or the new claim level selections.\n[43] In declining to accept Ms. Waldron\u2019s second claim, the claims administrator stated that \u201cthe Claims Process is designed for Claimants to submit their Claim form only once\u201d and that the \u201cJune 15th deadline [on the availability of the temporary allowance] was instituted in line with the Duties of the Claims Administrator ([under section]10.01) to develop, install and implement systems, guidelines and procedures for processing and making decisions on Applications.\u201d\n[44] The claims administrator accordingly accepted Ms. Waldron\u2019s claim only at level 1, and not at level 3 or level 4. She received and cashed a cheque for the $10,000 level 1 amount.\nF. The motions in the Federal Court [45] Ms. Waldron and another similarly situated survivor class member (who has not pursued an appeal to this Court) brought motions in the Federal Court, which were heard together by the supervising judge. They sought orders allowing them to change their claims to level 4 and instructing the claims administrator to consider the further information they had submitted to support their higher claim levels. They also sought a declaration that the IDSSA permits class members to submit further documentation and\/or modify their claim level selection prior to receiving a decision on their claims.\n[46] Before the supervising judge, the moving parties explained that they were frustrated, were panicked, or sought to end quickly the process of filing a claim. As a result, they initially submitted level 1 claims they knew did not reflect the most severe harm they experienced at their day school. They sought to file new, higher level claims at a later date, which they contended the IDSSA permitted them to do.\nG. Potential consequences of granting the motions [47] The claims administrator, which was granted leave to intervene, submitted evidence of the practical and administrative difficulties that would result from granting the motions.\n[48] According to the claims administrator, implementing progressive disclosure would likely result in the suspension of the claims adjudication process until all information for each claim was known. In addition, the claims administrator would have to check the many contacts it received from claimants daily by phone, email, and mail for additional information before adjudicating and paying claims. Level changes from level 1 to higher levels would further delay adjudication to take into account any information provided by Canada.\nH. Dismissal of the motions [49] The supervising judge dismissed the motions (McLean v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FC 987, Phelan J.). He held (at paragraph 49) that while the Federal Court has continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over the implementation of the IDSSA, it is severely limited in its review of the settlement agreement and its administration. It is not, he stated, the role of the Court to impose additional terms that it considers appropriate or to rewrite the agreement. In coming to this conclusion, he relied on statements in J.W. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 20 at paras. 34, 120, in stating that courts may intervene in class action settlements only in very limited circumstances, where relevant negotiated terms of the settlement are not applied or where there is a gap in the settlement agreement.\n[50] Here, the supervising judge reasoned (at paragraph 52), the relief the moving parties were seeking would essentially insert into the IDSSA a term permitting progressive disclosure, or the filing of multiple claims at different compensation levels. However, he stated, the IDSSA does not provide for progressive disclosure or multiple claims, so that to grant the individual relief sought would be inconsistent with the IDSSA and the intent of the parties. Accordingly, he concluded that he could not grant that relief.\n[51] The supervising judge also determined (at paragraphs 55-56) that the moving parties had no authority to seek a declaration on behalf of the class, and thus to supplement the court-approved responsibilities and obligations of the representative plaintiffs and class counsel. He noted that the moving parties had not sought leave under rule 334.31 of the Federal Courts Rules (referred to above at paragraph 13).\n[52] The supervising judge then considered (beginning at paragraph 57) the moving parties\u2019 submission that on a proper reading, the IDSSA provides for progressive disclosure as part of the intake phase of the claims process. In interpreting the IDSSA, he stated, he had considered the text, the context, and the stated or manifested intention of the parties.\n[53] Looking first to the text (at paragraph 59), he found nothing in the IDSSA suggesting that progressive disclosure or the right to file modified claims was a feature of the agreement. He noted that the IDSSA\u2019s use of the singular \u201cclaim\u201d was consistent with the position that it permitted a claimant to file only one claim. He also pointed to the reference in the IDSSA to filing the claim form with \u201call supporting documents\u201d, which he found indicative of finality to the filing of a claim.\n[54] Looking to context (at paragraph 65), the supervising judge observed that \u201ca key factor in the structure of the IDSSA was to avoid many of the problems associated with the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement [IRSSA], including the [Independent Assessment Process (IAP)] and its progressive disclosure feature.\u201d Under the IRSSA, a precursor to the IDSSA entered into in 2006, survivors of residential schools (as opposed to survivors of day schools with entitlements under the IDSSA) could seek compensation through the specially designed IAP. As the Supreme Court observed in Canada (Attorney General) v. Fontaine, 2017 SCC 47 at paras. 2-9, this entailed disclosure by claimants at an in-person hearing of \u201cacutely sensitive particulars\u2014both of the abuse suffered, and of its consequences\u2014for examination by an adjudicator.\u201d\n[55] The supervising judge noted (at paragraph 67) that at the settlement approval hearing, there was considerable evidence and submissions regarding the differences between the IRSSA process and the process then proposed for the IDSSA. Among the concerns expressed about the process under the IDSSA was that it could take time for class members to feel able to disclose the sexual abuse to which they had been subjected. Given the requirement to document claims at levels higher than level 1, class members could as a consequence end up claiming and taking level 1 benefits when they should be entitled to more: appeal book at 882-883, 911, 973-974. (This was in fact the position of Ms. Waldron, according to her evidence on this motion.) The supervising judge stated (at paragraph 69) that he was aware of the desire of some class members to have a process more like that of the IRSSA. On the other hand, he stated, there was also evidence that the simpler, paper-based, non-confrontational approach proposed for the IDSSA would be preferable to the \u201cextremely adversarial, confrontational and difficult\u201d process adopted in the IAP, and would, among other things avoid re-traumatization: appeal book at 1257-1258, 1299.\n[56] As a result, the supervising judge stated (at paragraph 69), he had been aware in approving the settlement of the concerns regarding the lack of provision for progressive disclosure, but nonetheless had found the settlement to be reasonable. He found that although the term \u201cprogressive disclosure\u201d was not used at the settlement approval hearing, in light of what had transpired there he understood that the IDSSA claims process \u201cwas not meant to follow such a feature.\u201d It would, he stated, be \u201cinconsistent to now import or interpret the IDSSA Claims Process in a manner giving effect to that aspect of the IRSSA. It would not be a fair and reasonable interpretation given this context.\u201d\n[57] The supervising judge further found (at paragraph 77), based on the parties\u2019 actions and submissions, that the intention of the parties did not support progressive disclosure as a binding concept in the IDSSA. He described it as \u201ccompelling\u201d, given the contractual nature of the IDSSA, that neither party to the agreement supported the moving parties\u2019 position.\n[58] The supervising judge went on to note (at paragraph 78) that the claims adjudicator, in accordance with its duties and responsibilities, had set up the claims process in conjunction with the parties, in a manner reflective of their understanding of the IDSSA. After reviewing the intake and assessment phases of the IDSSA claims process, he concluded that the intention of the parties was that \u201ca Claimant was to file for a single harm level with all the relevant documentation,\u201d and that the parties\u2019 actions were consistent with that intention.\n[59] The supervising judge stated (at paragraph 85) that he accepted the evidence of the claims administrator as to the practical and administrative difficulties that would result from \u201cunscrambling the egg\u201d, and adopting the moving parties\u2019 view as to the proper interpretation and application of the IDSSA. While these difficulties could not alone justify the position of the parties to the settlement agreement on the intention underlying claims process and their understanding of its terms, they helped to demonstrate that under the claims process, \u201ca single claim was to be filed and dealt with.\u201d\n[60] The supervising judge then addressed the submission that what the claims administrator did in permitting a form of progressive disclosure until June 15, 2020 reflected the proper interpretation and application of the IDSSA. He described this argument (at paragraph 92) as inconsistent with the evidence showing that the \u201ctemporary allowance or exception\u201d was indeed an exception and not the norm, and found that it had been implemented \u201cfor good reasons\u201d. He acknowledged that \u201c[i]n hindsight, it might have been preferable for the Claims Administrator to receive Court approval of the exception\u201d\u2014which, he stated, would likely have been provided. But, he went on, \u201cits absence does not vary the terms of the IDSSA.\u201d While the exception resulted in some claimants obtaining an opportunity to make progressive disclosure, to which they were not entitled under the IDSSA, the moving parties had received the benefits to which they were entitled, according to the parties\u2019 intentions and the text and context of the agreement. There was no \u201cgap\u201d to fill.\n[61] Having also found, as noted above, that the moving parties had no entitlement to claim relief on behalf of the class, the supervising judge dismissed the motions.\nIII. Issues on appeal [62] Based on the written and oral submissions of the parties, I would distill the issues on appeal as follows.\n(1) What standard or standards of review apply?\n(2) Did the supervising judge err in interpreting the IDSSA?\n(3) Did the supervising judge err in determining that he had no jurisdiction to grant Ms. Waldron the individual relief she claimed?\n(4) Did the supervising judge err in determining that Ms. Waldron had no entitlement to seek relief on behalf of the class?\n[63] I will consider each of these issues. As will be seen, they are to a large degree interrelated.\n(1) What standard or standards of review apply? [64] Ms. Waldron acknowledges that, as the Supreme Court stated in respect of the IRSSA in Fontaine at para. 35, the IDSSA \u201cis at root a contract\u201d. Its interpretation, like that of other contracts, is therefore reviewable, absent extricable questions of law, as a question of mixed fact and law, on the deferential standard of palpable and overriding error. However, she submits that the correctness standard applies in this appeal because, and to the extent that, it \u201craises extricable questions of law related to the interpretation of the IDSSA and the supervising judge\u2019s jurisdiction under [the] approval order\u201d (appellant\u2019s memorandum at paragraph 23).\n[65] The Attorney General submits that the substantive issues raised in this appeal are principally concerned with interpretation of the IDSSA, and to that extent are subject to review on the deferential palpable and overriding error standard. However, he recognizes that the supervising judge\u2019s determination of the scope of his jurisdiction to intervene raises a question of law, subject to review for correctness.\n[66] Similarly, class counsel rely on Fontaine in submitting that the supervising judge\u2019s interpretation of the IDSSA is reviewable for palpable and overriding error, absent an extricable error of law. They also accept, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in J.W., that Ms. Waldron\u2019s entitlement to obtain the relief sought and the supervising judge\u2019s entitlement to grant it are subject to review for correctness.\n[67] I accept the parties\u2019 substantial agreement on the issue of standards of review. I will consider the second issue identified above\u2014whether the supervising judge erred in interpreting the IDSSA\u2014on the standard of palpable and overriding error, except to the extent that it involves extricable questions of law, which call for correctness review. I will treat the third and fourth issues as reviewable on the standard of correctness.\n[68] Before I proceed with consideration of the remaining issues, it may be helpful to offer, by way of further legal context, a few reminders about the distinctive nature of class action settlements.\nFirst, class action settlements differ from most other settlements of litigation in requiring the approval of a judge before they can take effect: see rule 334.29(1).\nSecond, negotiating a settlement will invariably entail trade-offs and compromise: Ch\u00e2teauneuf v. Canada, 2006 FC 286 at para. 7. We do not know what trade-offs and compromises were made here. Third, the well-established test for judicial approval is that the settlement be shown to be fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of the class as a whole: Condon v. Canada, 2018 FC 522 at para. 17. As the supervising judge recognized, this standard does not require perfection, only reasonableness: 2019 FC 1075 at para. 76. Fourth, the judge\u2019s assessment of a proposed settlement is \u201ca binary, take-it-or-leave-it proposition. [\u2026] The Court is not permitted to change the settlement terms, impose additional terms or promote the interests of certain class members over those of the whole class\u201d: Toronto Standard Condominium Corporation No. 1654 v. Tri-Can Contract Incorporated, 2022 FC 1796 at para. 17. Fifth, the focus on the interests of the class as a whole may mean that a settlement is approved even if it does not meet the needs or demands of particular class members, or benefits some ahead of others: Condon at para 17; Manuge v. Canada, 2013 FC 341 at para. 24; H\u00e9bert v. Wenham, 2020 FCA 186 at para. 9, leave to appeal refused, 2021 CanLII 49683 (SCC). And sixth, a judicially approved settlement is nonetheless binding on every class member who has not opted out of the proceeding: see rule 334.29(2). Here, Ms. Waldron did not opt out of the class proceeding within the period for doing so.\n[69] I will now proceed to the remaining issues.\n(2) Did the supervising judge err in interpreting the IDSSA? [70] Ms. Waldron submits that the supervising judge committed a series of extricable errors of law in interpreting the IDSSA. She submits that (a) contrary to the law governing the interpretation of contracts, the supervising judge relied on the parties\u2019 subjective intention and on post-contract conduct to support his interpretation; (b) he denied Ms. Waldron the benefit of the basic procedural right to amend a claim; (c) he overlooked the principles set out in section 9.03 of the IDSSA, which she says require an interpretation that favours claimants; (d) he made findings of fact for which there was no supporting evidence (which Ms. Waldron also submits was a palpable and overriding error of fact); and (e) he failed to consider the honour of the Crown and reconciliation in his interpretation.\n[71] The intervener the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) makes further submissions asserting error by the supervising judge in failing to consider the honour of the Crown as a relevant interpretive principle. The FSIN also submits that he erred in failing to consider as an element of his interpretation of the IDSSA whether it conforms to international law and Canada\u2019s international obligations.\n[72] The intervener the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) similarly submits that international law norms are applicable in interpreting the IDSSA. It also recounts its knowledge of and experience with issues that arose under the IRSSA, and in particular with Canada\u2019s interpretation and discharge of its document disclosure obligations, the litigation of entitlement to destroy claimants\u2019 records, privacy issues, and procedural fairness.\n[73] I will discuss in sequence these claims of error. I will then consider what follows from my assessment to determine whether any of these claims are made out.\n(a) Subjective intention and post-contract conduct [74] As a document that \u201cis at root a contract,\u201d construing the IDSSA requires ascertaining \u201cthe objective intentions of the parties\u201d: Fontaine at para. 35. That exercise requires reading the contract as a whole, giving the words used their ordinary and grammatical meaning, and doing so consistently with the surrounding circumstances, or factual matrix: Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp., 2014 SCC 53 at paras. 47, 50, 58.\n[75] The factual matrix comprises \u201cobjective evidence of the background facts at the time of the execution of the contract [\u2026], that is, knowledge that was or reasonably ought to have been within the knowledge of both parties at or before the date of contracting\u201d: Sattva at paras. 50, 58. While the surrounding circumstances will be considered, they \u201cmust never be allowed to overwhelm the words of [the] agreement,\u201d or in effect to create a new agreement: Sattva at para. 57.\n[76] Evidence of subjective intention of the parties \u201chas no independent place\u201d in the determination of contractual meaning: Eli Lilly & Co. v. Novopharm Ltd., 1998 CanLII 791 (SCC), [1998] 2 S.C.R. 129 at paras. 54-59; Sattva at para. 59; ING Bank N.V. v. Canpotex Shipping Services Limited, 2017 FCA 47 at paras. 111-112, 117, 120-121, 125.\n[77] Nor does the factual matrix include subsequent or post-contract conduct. This, it has been held, is a category of conduct that may be considered only when ambiguity remains after the text is construed in light of the factual matrix, and only if the court is mindful of the inherent dangers associated with it: Re Canadian National Railways and Canadian Pacific Ltd. (1978), 95 D.L.R. (3d) 252 at 262 (B.C.C.A.), aff\u2019d 1979 CanLII 229 (SCC), [1979] 2 S.C.R. 668; Shewchuk v. Blackmont Capital Inc., 2016 ONCA 912 at paras. 40-46; and for other recent examples, Wade v. Duck, 2018 BCCA 176 at paras. 28, 31; Magasins Hart Inc. v. 3409 Rue Principale Inc., 2020 NBCA 49 at paras. 50-52.\n[78] Ms. Waldron submits that the supervising judge committed extricable legal errors in interpreting the IDSSA by relying on subjective intentions and post-contract conduct. She puts forward at least five instances of this reliance: appellant\u2019s memorandum at paras. 35-40.\nFirst, she submits, he relied on evidence of the parties\u2019 post-contract conduct in the absence of any finding of ambiguity or acknowledgment of the inherent dangers of doing so.\nSecond, she says, he looked to the subjective intentions of the parties to the IDSSA, and conducted an analysis of those intentions separately from his analysis of the text of the IDSSA and the circumstances surrounding its execution. He was wrong, she says, to consider the parties\u2019 intentions separately and \u201cin addition to\u201d the text and context, when conclusions as to their intentions \u201cflow\u201d from the text and factual background and determining their objective intentions is \u201cthe goal of the exercise\u201d.\nThird, she submits, he was wrong to consider it \u201ccompelling\u201d that neither party to the IDSSA supported the moving parties\u2019 position.\nFourth, he relied on the claims administrator\u2019s subjective understanding of the claims process long after the execution and approval of the IDSSA.\nFifth, he relied on the claims administrator\u2019s account of the difficulties a right to amend would entail.\n[79] The dividing line between pre- and post-contract conduct is not always easy to discern. That may be especially so in this case, where the IDSSA incorporated the claims process and claim form, and was therefore not complete until they were finalized and approved. Moreover, in both Fontaine and J.W., the Supreme Court appears to have relied, in interpreting the IRSSA, on conduct that could be seen as post-contractual, as well as the intentions of the parties in negotiating the agreement.\n[80] The issue in Fontaine was whether the IRSSA should be interpreted as requiring that documents generated in the IAP be destroyed, to preserve confidentiality. Under the heading \u201cThe Surrounding Circumstances\u201d (at paras. 42-45), the Supreme Court considered, among other things, (1) evidence that both claimants and alleged perpetrators had relied on assurances of confidentiality, and that, without those assurances, the IAP could not have functioned; (2) evidence that confidentiality was also crucial to the participation of the church defendants; and (3) evidence that, according to the chief adjudicator, confidentiality was often the \u201ckey factor\u201d in whether a claim proceeded. In addition, the Court relied on the finding of the supervising judge in that case that the negotiators of the IRSSA intended the IAP to be a confidential and private process.\n[81] In J.W., the issue was whether, under the IRSSA, decisions of IAP adjudicators were subject to judicial review. Under the heading \u201cJudicial Recourse Is Available Only Where the Adjudicator Failed to Apply the Terms of the IAP,\u201d a four-judge majority considered among other things (at paras. 134-136, 175), the delays that had resulted from court involvement in the claims process during implementation of the settlement agreement, as well as statistics bearing on timeliness, and stated that further court involvement would result in further delay and \u201cwould surely be contrary to the intentions of the parties [\u2026]\u201d in creating the claims process set out in the agreement.\n[82] I return to the question whether the supervising judge made an extricable legal error in relying on subjective intentions and subsequent conduct. In my view, he did so, largely in the manner submitted by Ms. Waldron. I do not agree that he erred in separating his analysis of the parties\u2019 intentions from his analysis of the text and context\u2014the order and manner in which these factors are considered is not material as long as (if applicable) they are considered. But in providing his analysis he did not advert to or apply either the requirement to focus on the parties\u2019 objective rather than subjective intentions or the limits on consideration of post-contract conduct set out above in paragraph 77. While his analysis resembled in some respects that of the Supreme Court in Fontaine and J.W., in my view it fell short in its identification and application of the rules of contractual interpretation. I consider below, in concluding on the issue of contractual interpretation, the consequences of this error.\n(b) Right to amend [83] Ms. Waldron submits (at paragraphs 41 to 43 of her memorandum) that the supervising judge also committed an extricable error of law in his textual interpretation of the IDSSA in concluding that there was \u201cnothing in the IDSSA suggesting that progressive disclosure or the right to file changed Claims was a feature of the Agreement.\u201d She says that the provision in the IDSSA for filing a claim does not preclude the availability of \u201cbasic procedural rights\u201d such as the right to amend, and invokes case law of this Court stating that the purpose of that right is to determine \u201cthe real question in controversy between the parties.\u201d She submits, in consequence, that the IDSSA should be interpreted as including a right on the part of claimants to amend a claim while a decision on the claim is pending.\n[84] I would not accept this submission. There may be an implicit right to amend in some litigation or administrative proceedings (though I note that in the former context, the Federal Courts Rules are explicit in conferring the right, and also in most cases require leave before amendments may be made: see rules 75-76 and 200-201). But the claims process under the IDSSA is a different kind of proceeding; it is prescribed by contract, so that the rules governing litigation do not apply. To recognize an implicit right to amend the IDSSA would also run counter to the \u201centire agreement\u201d and the \u201cno amendment without consent of the parties\u201d clauses of the IDSSA, and would ignore the binding nature of the Agreement and its judicial approval. It would, in addition, deprive class action settlements of any certainty.\n(c) Principles in section 9.03 [85] Ms. Waldron submits (beginning at paragraph 62 of her memorandum) that in his analysis of the text and context of the IDSSA, the supervising judge \u201coverlooked a crucial feature of the Claim Process favouring Claimants, established in section 9.03, entitled \u2018Principles Governing Claims Administration\u2019.\u201d Section 9.03(2), quoted in part above at paragraph 19, states:\nThe intent is to minimize the burden on the Claimants in pursuing their Claims and to mitigate any likelihood of re-traumatization through the Claims Process. The Claims Administrator, Third Party Assessor, and the Exceptions Committee and its Members, shall, in the absence of reasonable grounds to the contrary, assume that a Claimant is acting honestly and in good faith. In considering an Application, the Claims Administrator, Third Party Assessor, and Exceptions Committee and its Members, shall draw all reasonable and favourable inferences that can be drawn in favour of the Claimant, as well as resolving any doubt as to whether a Claim has been established in favour of the Claimant.\n[86] Ms. Waldron submits that \u201csection 9.03 is key to understanding the Claims Process, its purpose and the intent of the parties.\u201d She says that in accordance with a plain reading, \u201cthe Claims Administrator had an obligation to adopt an interpretation of the IDSSA that would allow Claimants to change the level of self-harm self-identified and to file additional information \u2026.\u201d\n[87] In my view, it cannot be said that the supervising judge \u201coverlooked\u201d section 9.03 in interpreting the IDSSA. As the Attorney General points out (at paragraph 47 of his memorandum), the supervising judge referred to the content of the provision in his reasons granting settlement approval: 2019 FC 1075 at paras. 41, 107, 132. In his reasons on Ms. Waldron\u2019s motion, he quoted section 9.03(2) in full (at paragraph 17).\n[88] Moreover, appellate courts must presume that first-instance courts (like the Federal Court) considered and assessed all of the evidence before them, absent proof to the contrary: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 at para. 46; Mahjoub v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FCA 157 at paras. 66-67. Ms. Waldron has not rebutted this presumption.\n[89] In any event, the requirement in section 9.03(2) that \u201call reasonable and favourable inferences\u201d be drawn in the claimant\u2019s favour appears to refer to the assessment of individual claims, not to the structure of the IDSSA\u2019s claims process. The requirement is directed to \u201cthe Claims Administrator, Third Party Assessor, and the Exceptions Committee and its Members.\u201d Their role (with the partial exception of the claims administrator) relates to the disposition of individual claims. While the claims administrator does play a role in establishing that structure, its terms are unlikely to depend on inferences to be drawn concerning the claims of individual class members.\n[90] Similarly, the requirement in section 9.03(2) that claimants be presumed, \u201cin the absence of reasonable grounds to the contrary\u201d, to be \u201cacting honestly and in good faith\u201d also appears not to apply in interpreting the structure of the IDSSA\u2019s claims process. A claimant\u2019s honesty and good faith are important considerations in assessing specific claims under the IDSSA. However, these considerations do not affect the interpretation of the IDSSA or the claims process it establishes.\n(d) Honour of the Crown and reconciliation [91] Ms. Waldron, supported by the intervener FSIN, submits that the supervising judge erred in law by \u201cfailing to apply the rule that the IDSSA\u2019s interpretation must be informed by the honour of the Crown\u201d (Ms. Waldron\u2019s memorandum at paragraph 49; FSIN\u2019s memorandum at paragraphs 14-17). They derive this \u201crule\u201d from a description of the IRSSA set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Fontaine at para. 14: that \u201cthe IRSSA, while not a treaty, \u2018is at least as important as a treaty\u2019 and its interpretation must be informed by the honour of the Crown.\u201d\n[92] However, the passage of the Supreme Court\u2019s reasons on which Ms. Waldron and the FSIN rely is found in Fontaine under the heading \u201cJudicial History\u201d. It merely recounts the reasons of the supervising judge at first instance; it does not represent a holding on the scope or application of the honour of the Crown. The Supreme Court does not return to this subject in the balance of its reasons.\n[93] In Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14 at para. 68, the Supreme Court observed that \u201cnot all interactions between the Crown and Aboriginal people engage [the honour of the Crown]\u201d and that \u201c[i]n the past, it has been found to be engaged in situations involving reconciliation of Aboriginal rights with Crown sovereignty.\u201d\n[94] That is not the situation here. As the supervising judge noted in granting settlement approval (2019 FC 1075 at para. 129), this Court has recognized that while the statement of claim in this proceeding alleged a breach of Aboriginal rights, the IDSSA represents the settlement of tort-based claims involving only individual rights, and has no impact on any collectively held Aboriginal or treaty rights: Cree Nation of Eeyou Istchee (General Council) v. McLean, 2019 FCA 185 at paras. 8, 11; Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated v. McLean, 2019 FCA 186 at paras. 8, 11; Whapmagoostui First Nation v. McLean, 2019 FCA 187 at para. 11. Nor is this proceeding a contest solely between Indigenous peoples on one hand and the Crown on the other: there are Indigenous individuals\u2014including the representative plaintiffs\u2014on both sides of the issues.\n[95] Where the honour of the Crown is engaged in negotiations, it requires among other things that the Crown\u2019s representatives not engage in, or even appear to engage in, \u201csharp dealing\u201d: Manitoba Metis at para. 73. But here it has not been submitted, as I understand it, that there was any \u201csharp dealing\u201d in the negotiation of a settlement agreement that was judicially approved as fair and reasonable.\n[96] Moreover, as this Court stated in Saskatchewan (Attorney General) v. Witchekan Lake First Nation, 2023 FCA 105 at para. 128, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, 40870 (21 Dec 2023), interpretation of a modern agreement from the perspective of the honour of the Crown \u201cdoes not entitle a court to reopen and rewrite the settled terms of a modern agreement negotiated between sophisticated parties over many years and with independent legal advice.\u201d Nor can the honour of the Crown be \u201cused to read in obligations supplementary to or different from those that have been expressly agreed to by the parties [\u2026]\u201d: Witchekan Lake First Nation at para. 129; George Gordon First Nation v. Saskatchewan, 2022 SKCA 41 at para. 172, leave to appeal refused, 2023 CanLII 19734 (SCC).\n[97] It is also apparent from his reasons that the supervising judge was fully aware of the potential for the IDSSA, and its various provisions and benefits, to contribute to reconciliation. His reasons (at paragraph 23) and his reasons on the motion for settlement approval (2019 FC 1075 at paras. 1, 107) make this clear.\n(e) Supporting evidence [98] Ms. Waldron submits (at paragraph 53 of her memorandum) that the conclusion of the supervising judge that \u201cnothing in the IDSSA\u201d could suggest that \u201cthe right to file changed Claims was a feature of the Agreement\u201d constitutes either an error of law or a palpable and overriding factual error because it is unsupported by the evidence.\n[99] She argues in particular that the supervising judge erred in finding (at paragraphs 65 and 70 of his reasons) that \u201ca key factor in the structure of the IDSSA was to avoid many of the problems associated with the IRSSA, including the IAP process and its progressive disclosure feature,\u201d despite agreeing that the term \u201cprogressive disclosure\u201d was not used at the settlement approval hearing.\n[100] However, it is possible to raise or address concerns associated with progressive disclosure without expressly using the term. That, in my view, is what occurred at the settlement approval hearing. In their submissions in support of settlement approval (appeal book at 775-780, 794), class counsel explained the claim form and how it was designed to work. They wanted, they explained, \u201cto try and create something that would be an apparent break,\u201d and were \u201cmindful of not wishing to be involved in [\u2026] an independent assessment process, as was built into the Residential School process.\u201d One of the ways they sought to address their concerns, they explained, was to create clear designations of the levels from 2 to 5, to guide claimants in their selection of a single applicable level. They stated:\nIt is the heart, if you will, of the compensation model. And so it does require the individual to reflect, to have memory awakened or maybe restored, but what is then required is that one of those levels be then selected. That the individual sitting and reflecting on the worst thing that happened to them, chooses one of the levels.\n[\u2026]\nThe question about the compensation being less, or the structure being less or different than in the Indian Residential School. You know, we learn from circumstances. There were many aspects of the Indian Residential School IAP, that frankly we heard time, and time, and time again how destructive it was to the individuals who had to go through it. And it was very much a part and parcel that we would not repeat the process that was part of the IAP.\n[101] The supervising judge found (at paragraph 15 of his reasons) that an overriding goal of the IDSSA was \u201cto avoid the excesses, complexities, and other negative features of the [IRSSA] and its processes.\u201d Particularly in light of the emphasis on claimants selecting a single level, and the relative simplicity of that approach, it was open to the supervising judge to infer that progressive disclosure was among these excesses, complexities, and other negative features. There was no want of support for or palpable and overriding error in his finding.\n(f) Conformity with international law [102] The interveners the AFN and the FSIN submit that the interpretation of the IDSSA must take into account international law norms and instruments, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, G.A. Res. 295, UNGAOR, 61st Sess., Supp. No. 53, UN Doc A\/61\/53 (13 September 2007). I would disregard these submissions: they go beyond the permitted scope of the interventions.\n[103] The Court expressed its concern about the breadth of these interveners\u2019 submissions at the hearing of the appeal. The order of the Court granting the AFN and the FSIN leave to intervene imposed limits on their participation. These included that they (1) not repeat any of the appellant\u2019s submissions, (2) rely only on evidence that is part of the record in this proceeding, and (3) address only issues raised by the notice of appeal.\n[104] These limits are consistent with the principles governing interventions in this Court. An intervener must take the issues identified by the parties as it finds them, and cannot transform them or add to them: Macciacchera (Smoothstreams.tv) v. Bell Media Inc., 2023 FCA 180 at paras. 19-20. The interveners\u2019 oral submissions were subject to the same limitations, since ordinarily, only arguments included in a party\u2019s (or intervener\u2019s) memorandum may be advanced in oral argument: Kilback v. Canada, 2023 FCA 96 at para. 41.\n[105] Ms. Waldron\u2019s notice of appeal raises no issues relating to international law. Accordingly, submissions on this subject do not assist the Court in resolving the issues the parties have raised. I would not consider these submissions further.\n(g) Experience with the IRSSA [106] As noted above, the AFN also makes extensive submissions concerning document disclosure, document destruction, and procedural fairness issues that arose under the IRSSA. While some elements of the experience with the IRSSA are no doubt relevant here, as will be discussed further below, the relevant elements of that experience do not appear to include the specific issues to which the AFN refers. Those issues too go beyond what is raised in the notice of appeal. The facts the AFN asserts also go well beyond the record in this proceeding. I would disregard these submissions as well.\n(h) Conclusion on interpretation of the IDSSA [107] For the reasons I have set out, I conclude that the supervising judge committed an extricable error of law in his interpretation of the IDSSA, in impermissibly taking into account both the subjective intentions of the parties and their post-contract conduct, when the prerequisites for doing so were not met. Although this is the sole ground of attack on his interpretation that has succeeded, his decision on this point is therefore not entitled to deference, and it is appropriate that this Court interpret the agreement afresh, avoiding his error: Apotex Inc. v. ADIR, 2017 FCA 23 at para. 93; Ottawa (City) v. ClubLink Corporation ULC, 2021 ONCA 847 at paras. 46-47, leave to appeal refused, 2022 CanLII 69782 (SCC).\n[108] In doing so I start, as required by Sattva, with the text of the IDSSA, read as a whole. In my view, there are ample indications in the text of the agreement (some of which I have already noted) that it does not contemplate claimants amending their claims, or providing progressive disclosure.\n[109] These include, in the main body of the IDSSA,\nthe definition of \u201cApplication\u201d in section 1.01, which is cast in the singular and makes no reference to the possibility of amendment;\nthe definition of \u201cClaim\u201d in section 1.01, which is also cast in the singular and refers to submitting \u201can Application\u201d;\nthe references in section 9.03, which sets out certain principles governing claims administration, to the \u201cexpeditious\u201d nature of the contemplated process;\nthe references to the provision of further information only in the processes involving the Third Party Assessor and the Exceptions Committee; and\nthe \u201centire agreement\u201d clause in section 1.13.\n[110] There are further indications in Schedule B, entitled \u201cThe Claims Process\u201d:\nthe reference in section 1 to a claimant filing \u201chis\/her application form and all supporting documentation;\u201d and\nthe statement in section 4 that as part of the intake phase, \u201c[the] Claims Administrator sorts the applications of eligible Claimants in accordance with Claimants\u2019 self-identified Levels.\u201d\n[111] In addition, the claim form, as discussed above at paragraphs 25 and 28, expressly calls for claimants to self-select only one level\u2014either level 1 or one of levels 2 to 5.\n[112] On the other hand, like the supervising judge, I see nothing in the text that supports the interpretation that Ms. Waldron asked be adopted.\n[113] I turn then to the factual matrix, as defined in Sattva as \u201cknowledge that was or reasonably ought to have been within the knowledge of both parties at or before the date of contracting.\u201d Its key element here, in my view, is the parties\u2019 knowledge of the issues that arose with the IRSSA and its IAP, including their provision for in-person hearings and progressive disclosure. It was that pre-contractual knowledge that led the parties to adopt the claims process they adopted in the IDSSA, and especially its relatively simple, paper-based process based on self-assessment. The factual matrix therefore favours the interpretation adopted by the parties to the IDSSA.\n[114] I conclude that, despite the error committed by the supervising judge, his interpretation of the IDSSA was correct.\n(3) Did the supervising judge err in determining that he had no jurisdiction to grant Ms. Waldron the individual relief she claimed? [115] In my view, the supervising judge made no error in this regard.\n[116] As noted above, the supervising judge cited in considering the scope for judicial supervision of class action settlements the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in J.W. There, speaking for the majority on this issue, C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. stated (at para. 120) that\nIn the context of the supervision of a settlement agreement, the terms of the agreement are determinative. While supervising judges are not free to approve an agreement that fully ousts their supervisory jurisdiction, their authority is limited and shaped by the terms of the agreement, once it is approved and determined to be fair, reasonable and in the best interests of the class.\n[117] She added (at para. 140) that \u201ccases in which judicial intervention is warranted will be rare,\u201d and adopted as the test for the availability of judicial recourse in relation to the IRSSA a \u201cfailure by the IAP adjudicator to apply the terms of the IAP Model, which amounts to failure to enforce the IRSSA.\u201d She added (at para. 141) that \u201ccircumstances will inevitably arise that were not foreseen by the parties and are therefore not provided for in their agreement,\u201d and that should this situation\u2014a \u201cgap\u201d\u2014arise, \u201ccourts must have the power to intervene to ensure that the parties receive the benefits of the agreement, i.e., what they bargained for.\u201d\n[118] Justice Abella, who wrote on this issue for the minority of the Court, agreed (at para. 28) that there is a high threshold for judicial intervention. Courts nonetheless have a duty, she stated (at para. 30), \u201cto ensure that the claimants receive the benefits they bargained for.\u201d This entails, she further stated (at para. 35), \u201cfocus[ing] on the words of the Agreement, so that the benefits promised to the class members are delivered.\u201d She also recognized (at para. 26) the existence of a \u201cgap\u201d in a settlement agreement as a basis for judicial intervention.\n[119] I have quoted above the provision of the settlement approval order in this case that addresses judicial supervision. I repeat it here for ease of reference:\nThis Court, without in any way affecting the finality of this Order, reserves exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over this action, the Plaintiffs, all Class Members who have not opted out of the Settlement Agreement, and the Defendant for the limited purposes of implementing the Settlement Agreement and enforcing and administering the Settlement Agreement and this Order.\n[120] The supervising judge correctly recognized (at paragraph 48 of his reasons) both the existence of and the limits on his supervisory jurisdiction under the order. He correctly understood that it was \u201cnot the Court\u2019s role to impose terms that it thinks appropriate nor to rewrite the IDSSA.\u201d He correctly recognized (at paragraph 52) that to grant Ms. Waldron what she was seeking would give her relief for which the IDSSA did not provide.\n(4) Did the supervising judge err in determining that Ms. Waldron had no authority to seek relief on behalf of the class? [121] It follows from my conclusion on the preceding question that this question need not be addressed. The reasons why the supervising judge had no jurisdiction to grant Ms. Waldron the personal relief she claimed apply equally to her claim for relief for other class members. However, I will deal briefly with some further aspects of this question.\n[122] In the class proceedings regime, it is ordinarily the representative plaintiff or plaintiffs (or, depending on the nature of the proceeding, one or more representative defendants, applicants, or respondents), who have the right and the responsibility to represent the interests of class members and instruct class counsel on their behalf: see rule 334.16(1)(e); Canada v. John Doe, 2016 FCA 191 at para. 75; Bancroft-Snell at paras. 3-4; Coburn and Watson\u2019s Metropolitan Home v. Home Depot of Canada Inc., 2019 BCCA 308 at paras. 14-16, leave to appeal refused, 2020 CanLII 23626 (SCC) and 2020 CanLII 23639 (SCC).\n[123] Ms. Waldron was not named as a representative plaintiff. Therefore, absent some proper basis to conclude otherwise, she had no entitlement to seek relief on behalf of the class, even if the supervising judge had jurisdiction to grant it.\n[124] I have already noted (at paragraph 13 above) that the supervising judge, in coming to his conclusion on this issue, relied in part on Ms. Waldron\u2019s failure to seek leave under rule 334.31(2). But that rule did not apply in the circumstances before him.\n[125] As this Court has confirmed, rule 334.31(2) applies only where a representative plaintiff or applicant has a right of appeal but chooses not to exercise it. In those circumstances, another class member may seek leave to step into the shoes of the representative party and exercise the right of appeal. To obtain leave, the class member must show that he or she will fairly and adequately represent the class in the appeal, and that the appeal itself is in the best interests of the class: Frame v. Riddle, 2018 FCA 204 at paras. 24-25; Ottawa v. McLean at paras. 11, 13. Even if Ms. Waldron had sought leave under rule 334.31(2), therefore, it would not have availed her: no right of appeal was in issue before the supervising judge.\n[126] However, there was a route through which Ms. Waldron could potentially have sought authority to represent the interests of the class or some of its members\u2014she could have applied for permission to participate in the proceeding under rule 334.23. That rule authorizes the court to permit class members other than the representative plaintiff to participate in a class proceeding. It reads as follows:\n334.23 (1) To ensure the fair and adequate representation of the interests of a class or any subclass, the Court may, at any time, permit one or more class members to participate in the class proceeding.\n(2) When permitting a class member to participate in the proceeding, the Court shall give directions regarding the role of the participant, including matters relating to costs and to the procedures to be followed.\n334.23 (1) Afin que les int\u00e9r\u00eats du groupe ou d\u2019un sous-groupe soient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et ad\u00e9quate, la Cour peut, en tout temps, autoriser un ou plusieurs membres du groupe \u00e0 participer au recours collectif.\n(2) La Cour assortit l\u2019autorisation de directives concernant le r\u00f4le du participant, notamment en ce qui concerne les d\u00e9pens et la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre.\n[127] Ms. Waldron did not seek permission under rule 334.23 either before the supervising judge or in her written representations or oral submissions in this Court. However, while this Court\u2019s decision was under reserve, the current supervising judge (Grammond J.) relied on this rule, together with the law of standing, in granting a class member leave to participate in a motion seeking expressly to amend the IDSSA: McLean v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 1093 at paras. 50-55. (The decision is now on appeal to this Court (Court File A-235-23), but the appeal does not appear to challenge the participation element of the decision.)\n[128] This Court advised the parties and interveners in this appeal that it would consider brief written submissions concerning the Federal Court decision. In response, Ms. Waldron submitted, among other things, that the decision reinforced her position that she should be granted standing. The interveners FSIN and AFN made submissions to the same effect. The FSIN also submitted that a motion is not a prerequisite for the Court to grant Ms. Waldron permission to participate, and referred to decisions under similar provisions in Ontario and British Columbia recognizing that the purpose of rule 334.23 is to protect the interests of class members.\n[129] Class counsel submitted that the rule did not affect the supervising judge\u2019s determination that Ms. Waldron lacked the authority to seek a declaration on behalf of the class. They noted that the reasons of Grammond J. focused on the interest the class member might have in bringing her motion and not \u201cthe extraordinary nature of the relief she was seeking.\u201d The general rule remained, they submitted, that only a court-appointed representative party may act on behalf of and bind the class.\n[130] The Attorney General and the intervener Deloitte did not provide submissions. None of the parties and interveners making submissions sought to provide evidence that might bear on the potential application of rule 334.23. Such evidence would include, for example, evidence of the kind the court must consider when appointing representative parties on certification who will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class, or when appointing another class member under rule 334.31 to exercise the representative parties\u2019 right of appeal: see Ottawa v. McLean at paras. 13, 22.\n[131] Given my conclusion on the jurisdiction of the supervising judge, it is not necessary that I decide on the application of rule 334.23 in order to resolve the questions before the Court. In all of the circumstances, I would decline to do so.\nIV. Proposed disposition [132] I would dismiss the appeal. Consistent with the position of the parties, I would make no award of costs.\n\u201cJ.B.

Context [3] EllisDon Corporation filed a complaint with the Canadian International Trade Tribunal concerning a solicitation issued by the Department of Public Works and Government Services (Public Works) for the rehabilitation and optimization of a building.\n[4] EllisDon alleged that Public Works failed to evaluate the tenders in accordance with the invitation to tender and thereby breached trade agreements. EllisDon sought, among others, compensation for lost opportunity from the date it was awarded the contract to the date the contract was awarded to another tenderer.\n[5] The Tribunal issued its Determination on September 25, 2023 and its reasons on October 10, 2023 (the Decision). The Tribunal found EllisDon\u2019s complaint to be valid. The Tribunal further recommended that Public Works compensate EllisDon for \u201cits lost opportunity, if any\u201d. In this regard, the Tribunal recommended \u201cthat the parties negotiate the amount of compensation, if any\u201d, and that they report back to the Tribunal on the outcome of their negotiations within 60 days of the date of the issuance of the Tribunal\u2019s reasons. Finally, the Tribunal wrote that should the parties be unable to agree \u201con the amount of the compensation\u201d, the Tribunal would establish the final amount of the compensation after having provided the parties with the opportunity to file full submissions on this issue.\n[6] The Attorney General filed a judicial review application of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision. The application states that the Decision is unreasonable and that the Tribunal exceeded its statutory authority when it recommended compensation for EllisDon.\n[7] A few days after the filing of his judicial review application, the Attorney General moved for an order staying his application \u201cuntil 30 days following the outcome of the compensation phase before the Tribunal\u201d.\n[8] As a result of the Attorney General\u2019s motion for a stay, EllisDon asked the Tribunal to hold the compensation phase in abeyance until this Court rules on the Attorney General\u2019s judicial review application or on his motion to stay his application. Despite the Attorney General\u2019s request that the compensation phase continue, the Tribunal decided to hold the compensation phase of EllisDon\u2019s complaint proceeding in abeyance until this Court has ruled on the Attorney General\u2019s motion to stay his application for judicial review.\nII. Analysis [9] Paragraph 50(1)(b) of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 confers a discretionary power on this Court to stay a proceeding before it where \u201cit is in the interests of justice\u201d. The exercise of this discretionary power is guided by certain principles, including securing \u201cthe just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every proceeding on its merits\u201d: Rule 3 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106 (the Rules); Coote v. Lawyers\u2019 Professional Indemnity Company, 2013 FCA 143 at para. 12. In this regard, it will take much to convince this Court to grant a stay where a long period of abeyance is requested or when the ensuing delay will cause harsh effects on a party: Mylan Pharmaceuticals ULC v. AstraZeneca Canada, Inc., 2011 FCA 312 at para. 5.\n[10] The Attorney General says that three \u201ckey circumstances\u201d militate in favour of staying his application.\nA. Negotiations Not Concluded [11] First, the Attorney General argues that this Court should stay his application so that the parties can continue negotiations on the amount of the compensation. Should the parties reach an agreement, the entire matter may be resolved, and if not, the Tribunal will rule on the amount of compensation.\n[12] I disagree that this argument militates in favour of staying the judicial review application. As EllisDon justly notes, parties do no need a stay to negotiate a resolution of their dispute.\n[13] I would add that there is no guarantee that the parties will agree on the amount of the compensation. Failing such an agreement, the Tribunal will have to proceed with the compensation phase of the complaint process. EllisDon submits that this could be a lengthy and costly phase. To support its argument, EllisDon refers to prior decisions from the Tribunal, which illustrate that more than a year may elapse between the Tribunal making a determination on a complaint\u2019s validity and the Tribunal rendering a decision on compensation. For instance, in The Masha Krupp Translation Group Ltd. v. Canada Revenue Agency, the reasons on validity were issued on March 20, 2017 (see 2017 CanLII 149224 (CA CITT)), and the reasons on compensation were issued on October 17, 2018 (see 2018 CanLII 146634 (CA CITT)); in Oshkosh Defense Canada v. Department of Public Works and Government Services, the reasons on validity were issued on July 20, 2016 (see 2016 CanLII 153258 (CA CITT)), and those regarding compensation were issued on December 29, 2017 (see 2018 CanLII 146784 (CA CITT)).\n[14] Highlighting the time that may elapse between a determination on validity and a determination on compensation is in no way meant to criticize the work of the Tribunal. Rather, it is an acknowledgement that the compensation phase of the Tribunal\u2019s work is complex and involves significant financial, accounting and evidentiary work for the parties to file, and for the Tribunal to consider. The point is that telling the parties that they need to proceed to the determination of the amount of the compensation phase of the complaint without further justification would not be in line with the guiding principle of securing the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every proceeding on its merits.\nB. The Scope of the Compensation Remains Undecided [15] The Attorney General argues that the scope of the compensation remains unclear and that the Tribunal should decide this issue before this Court is required to intervene.\n[16] Again, I disagree. The Tribunal identified the scope of the compensation: Public Works is to \u201ccompensate EllisDon for its lost opportunity cost in this instance\u201d: Decision at paras. 72, 83, 90.\n[17] Furthermore, the sole ground of review raised in the Attorney General\u2019s judicial review application is that the Tribunal allegedly \u201cexceeded its statutory authority when it recommended compensation for EllisDon\u2019s alleged lost opportunity\u201d. During the validity phase of EllisDon\u2019s complaint, Public Works made the same argument and the Tribunal rejected it: Decision at paras. 67-72. It follows that the Tribunal will not revisit the issue of the compensation\u2019s scope nor whether it had authority to recommend it. Indeed, the Decision makes clear that the next phase of the complaint process will be dedicated to establishing the \u201camount\u201d of the compensation, either by way of negotiation between the parties or, if necessary, by the Tribunal: Decision at para. 90.\n[18] In this context, it would defy logic for this Court to acquiesce to the Attorney General\u2019s request to stay the proceeding to let the Tribunal decide an issue that it will not decide.\nC. Judicial Economy [19] The Attorney General\u2019s last argument is that the bifurcation of the Tribunal\u2019s determination\u2014the validity of the complaint phase and the amount of compensation phase\u2014mandates that his application for judicial review be stayed. Otherwise, there is a risk of costly duplication of judicial resources and inconsistent findings flowing from:\n\u2022the possibility that a negotiated settlement on the amount of the compensation or the Tribunal\u2019s determination of that amount will render the judicial review application unnecessary; and\n\u2022the possibility of two judicial review applications: the one presently before this Court and a second one regarding the amount of the compensation.\n[20] While I agree that unnecessary judicial proceedings, duplication of judicial resources, and inconsistent findings should be avoided, I do not think that there is such a risk of these situations happening if I do not grant a stay of the Attorney General\u2019s judicial review application. Let me explain.\n[21] As this Court has stated, \u201c[b]ifurcation, without more, is not a golden ticket to a stay\u201d: Laperri\u00e8re v. D. & A. MacLeod Company Ltd., 2010 FCA 84 at para. 21. This is particularly true when the two phases of a proceedings are not \u201cinextricably linked\u201d: Clayton v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 1 at para. 19. Here, there is no need for the amount of the compensation to be known for this Court to rule on whether the Tribunal had the statutory authority to recommend compensation for lost opportunity cost. Moreover, a determination of the amount of compensation will not resolve the issue of the Tribunal\u2019s statutory authority such that, if Public Works disagrees with an amount determined by the Tribunal, the Attorney General will pursue the present judicial review application. By contrast, as EllisDon points out, a decision of this Court that the Tribunal did not have the statutory authority will put to rest the issue of the amount of the compensation. It is therefore in the parties\u2019 interest to find out at the earliest opportunity whether the Tribunal had the authority to recommend compensation for lost opportunity.\n[22] Not only will this knowledge determine the necessity of the second phase of the complaint before the Tribunal, but it might also save considerable costs to the parties if this second phase proves unnecessary. At paragraphs [13] and [14] above, I highlighted how complex and demanding the determination of the amount of compensation phase could be. Such a complex and demanding process is likely to entail significant costs to the parties. These costs should not be incurred unless necessary, but this necessity will not be known if the Attorney General\u2019s judicial review application is stayed.\n[23] In light of the above, I conclude that judicial economy and the interests of justice do not support the Attorney General\u2019s request for a stay of his judicial review application.\nIII. Conclusion [24] Consequently, the motion for a stay will be dismissed with costs in favour of the respondent.\n\"Nathalie Goyette\"\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-289-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA v.

Wilson, 2023 FC 1289, 2023 CarswellNat 3646, per Strickland J.), the Federal Court granted a judicial review application, set aside a decision of a band election appeal committee and remitted the question whether there had been an election irregularity to a differently constituted band election committee. The Federal Court set strict deadlines within which the redetermination was to take place. The election appeal committee was accordingly reconstituted, considered the matter, declared the election invalid and required a new election take place in short order. That election has now been held.\n[3] The respondents subsequently filed a motion under rule 369.2 of the Federal Court Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106 to dismiss the appeal on the basis that it was moot. The motion came before Stratas J.A on November 28, 2023 (Wilson v. Meeches, 2023 FCA 233, 2023 CarswellNat 4752). I will not repeat his detailed review of the events leading up to the decision in the Federal Court and thereafter; it is sufficient to say that Stratas J.A. observed that the Federal Court judgment was fully implemented. However, he concluded that the question whether the appeal should be dismissed on the basis that it was moot required a full panel of this Court and was to be determined on written submissions.\n[4] The appellants resist the motion to dismiss their appeal. The substance of the appellants\u2019 argument is that there are significant legal issues arising from the judgment of the Federal Court and in respect of which the Federal Court erred. They argue that the Court\u2019s guidance on these issues would assist the Long Plain First Nation electorate going forward and also guide future election committees in the execution of their responsibilities.\n[5] Whether an appeal that is otherwise moot ought nevertheless be heard is a discretionary decision, governed by the well-known criteria in Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), 1989 CanLII 123 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342: the existence of an adversarial relationship, whether the question is elusive of review, judicial economy and the overarching question of the best interest of the administration of justice (at 358-363).\n[6] I would not exercise this Court\u2019s discretion to hear this appeal. I am not persuaded that the legal issues raised by the appellants need to be addressed at this time or are elusive of review. Should these issues arise in the future, there are many steps available to the appellants to preserve their interests; including an interim stay motion, which can be brought in very short order with minimal procedural requirements.\n[7] Stratas J.A. gave clear and complete guidance as to how steps can be taken to preserve legal rights pending an appeal, including a motion for an interim stay, which is temporary, brought on an urgent basis and designed to preserve matters before the Court decides whether the judgment under appeal ought to be stayed pending appeal. An interim stay having been obtained, parties can move quickly to file a motion for a stay and request an expedited hearing of the appeal on the merits. Again, adverting to Stratas J.A. in the earlier motion (at paras. 29 and 21):\nThis Court is \u201caccessible 24 hours a day, [every day of the] year, from coast to coast for urgent applications, in both official languages\u201d: Brown [v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FCA 130, [2021] 1 F.C.R. 53] at para. 159. When necessary, this Court can act quickly outside of normal working hours, even on the evening of a quiet public holiday\u2026 In the Federal Courts system, things can and do move fast, especially when a party asks us to go fast. For us, \u201caccess to justice\u201d is much more than an attractive slogan in a tweet or a lofty phrase in a news release. It has been a call to action. And, for a long time, plenty of action there has been. See the article by Professor Gerard Kennedy, \u201cThe Federal Courts Advantage in Civil Procedure\u201d (October 31, 2023), online: https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4619359.\n[8] I am therefore not satisfied that the appellants will inevitably or necessarily be prejudiced should these issues arise again. There is no procedural reason why the correctness of the Federal Court decision cannot be put before this Court in another appeal without prejudice to the rights of the parties.\n[9] It is also preferable that important legal questions be decided in a factual context and between parties with opposing perspectives. Should the legal questions raised in the Notice of Appeal filed in respect of the Federal Court decision under appeal arise in the future, as counsel suggests they will, they can be addressed at that time and in that context, where there is a live controversy between parties with opposing interests.\n[10] I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\"Donald J.

Introduction [1] This appeal, which arises from a unique set of circumstances, involves the class definition in the context of class proceedings.\n[2] More particularly, at issue in this appeal is whether it was open to the Judge of the Federal Court (the certification judge) to reinstate the Family Class as part of the class definition originally certified after its inadvertent removal from the certification order.\n[3] For the reasons that follow, the appeal should be allowed.\nII. Procedural History [4] Four years ago, on January 23, 2020, in Greenwood v. Canada, 2020 FC 119 (Greenwood FC), the certification judge granted an order certifying a class proceeding against the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The Class included two groups\u2014the Class and the Family Class\u2014and was defined as follows:\nAll persons who reside in Canada who were or are Regular Members, Special Constables Members, Reservists, Supernumerary Special Constables, Civilian Members, and Public Service Employees under s. 10 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, RSC 1985, c R-10, Volunteers, Auxiliary Constables, Non-Profit Employees, Temporary Civilian Employees, Casual Employees, Term Employees, Cadets, Pre-Cadets, Students, Contract Employees, Municipal Employees, and others who work or worked with the RCMP (the \u201cClass\u201d); and\nAll individuals who are entitled to assert a claim pursuant to the Family Law Act, RSO 1990 c F.3, and equivalent or comparable legislation in other provinces and territories (the \u201cFamily Class\u201d)\n[5] A week later, on January 31, 2020, the respondents filed notice of a motion to vary the Greenwood FC certification order on the basis that the class definition was erroneous. Specifically, the certification judge had mistakenly included the initially proposed class definition, notwithstanding the fact that the respondents had previously filed a revised class definition.\n[6] Nearly simultaneously, on February 3, 2020, the appellant filed a notice of appeal in this Court against the order granting the certification in Greenwood FC.\n[7] On April 21, 2020, the certification judge granted the respondents\u2019 motion to vary the certification order. In so doing, the certification judge amended the class definition (April 2020 Order, unreported):\nThe definition of the Class shall be:\nAll persons who reside in Canada who worked with or for the RCMP being all current or former:\nRCMP Members: including all Regular Members, Civilian Members, Special Constables, Special Constable Members, Supernumerary Special Constables, Reservists, and Recruits;\nPublic Service Employees (\u201cPSEs\u201d) who are not able to grieve under s. 208 of the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 2 (\u201cFPSLRA\u201d): including all indeterminate, term. And casual PSEs; and\nOthers who work within RCMP workplaces: including but not limited to; temporary civilian employees, community constables, auxiliary constables, cadets, pre-cadets, students, independent and subcontractor employees (including Commissionaires, custodial worker, guards\/matrons, individuals employed through temporary agencies, and interns \u2013 e.g. Youth Internship Program), other government employees (including municipal, regional or similar levels of government employees and seconded officers and employees, including Interchange Canada participants) who are not entitled to grieve under s. 208 of the FPSLRA, volunteers, and non-profit organization employees; individuals working or attending courses on RCMP premises; and any other individuals who worked with or for the RCMP and who have a Human Resources management Information Services (\u201cHRMIS\u201d) identification.\n[8] However, the above amendments inadvertently removed the Family Class from the certification order. The parties did not notice the omission at this point.\n[9] On September 21, 2021, this Court issued its decision regarding the appeal of the amended Greenwood FC certification order. This Court found that the certification judge had erred in defining the Class and in certifying one of the common questions (Canada v. Greenwood, 2021 FCA 186, [2021] 4 FCR 635 (Greenwood FCA) (leave to appeal to SCC refused, 39885 (March 17, 2022)). This Court accordingly ordered that the class definition be curtailed to only include RCMP Members and Reservists. This Court thus set aside the amended Greenwood FC certification order and remitted it to the Federal Court to be revised in accordance with this Court\u2019s judgment.\n[10] Subsequently, on July 8, 2022, the respondents wrote to the Federal Court to raise the question of the inadvertent omission of the Family Class from the April 2020 Order:\nIn [their January 29, 2020 Motion to Vary], the Plaintiffs inadvertently used the Primary Class Definition as a standalone Revised Class Definition, instead of consolidating it with the FLA Class that was separately referenced in a later part of the Memorandum of Law.\nThis had the unintended effect of removing the FLA Class from the certified class definition, despite the fact that it was advanced (and responded to) at certification, and was certified by this Court in both its reasons and order.\n[11] On September 20, 2022, the certification judge made the amendments to the certification order as required by this Court\u2019s judgment in Greenwood FCA (2022 FC 1317). She did so on the understanding that the respondents would soon thereafter bring a motion to vary addressing the issue of the exclusion of the Family Class in the April 2020 Order.\n[12] In the interim, the appellant indicated that it did not consent to having the Family Class reinstated into the class definition.\n[13] On February 24, 2023, the certification judge heard the respondents\u2019 motion to vary regarding the question of the omission of the Family Class from the class definition.\n[14] On March 22, 2023, the certification judge granted the respondents\u2019 motion and amended the certification order by reinstating the Family Class to the class definition (Greenwood v. Canada, 2023 FC 397). This is the Order under challenge in the current appeal. It will be referred to as the Order under Appeal.\nIII. The Order under Appeal [15] In rendering the Order under Appeal, the certification judge acknowledged that the respondents\u2019 counsel was not solely responsible for the inadvertent omission of the Family Class. She noted that the Court itself had failed to flag the omission and that the appellant had not raised it either (Order under Appeal at paras 4\u20135).\n[16] The certification judge then proceeded to address the appellant\u2019s arguments against re-certification for the purposes of reinstating the Family Class. The appellant\u2019s arguments were put forward on the following grounds: (1) the doctrine of issue estoppel, (2) the doctrine of functus officio, (3) the lack of \u201csome basis in fact,\u201d and (4) the unworkability of the Family Class definition. Prior to addressing the grounds as raised by the appellant, the certification judge stated that, in her view, Rule 334.19 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106 (the Rules) conferred the necessary power to amend the certification order.\n[17] The certification judge then turned to the appellant\u2019s arguments. Firstly, in connection with issue estoppel, the certification judge ruled that the circumstances did not preclude her from amending the certification order to include the Family Class. Specifically, she found that the issue at hand had not been finally determined by either the Greenwood FCA decision or her own Order of April 2020. In the words of the certification judge (1) the \u201cFCA decision does not directly address the Family Class claim\u201d and (2) \u201cmotions at the class certification stage are essentially procedural motions and do not involve decisions on the merits\u201d (Order under Appeal at paras 17, 19).\n[18] Regarding the application of the doctrine of functus officio, the certification judge ruled that the doctrine only applies to final decisions and that certification orders do not constitute \u201ca final finding on the merits of a case\u201d (Order under Appeal at para. 24). She added that should the doctrine apply, there exists an exception to its application \u201cwhere there is a slip-up or error in expressing a court\u2019s manifested intention or statutory power to revisit an order\u201d (ibid. at para. 25).\n[19] With respect to the appellant\u2019s argument that there was a lack of \u201csome basis in fact\u201d to support the existence of the Family Class, the certification judge ruled that there had been no change in circumstances since the original certification order that would allow her to revisit the evidence (Order under Appeal at paras 29\u201335). She further noted that she did not consider this Court\u2019s decision in Greenwood FCA as invalidating her Family Class findings and analysis (ibid. at para. 33).\n[20] Finally, the certification judge addressed the appellant\u2019s argument regarding the workability of the Family Class definition by finding that \u201cthe Family Class is a derivative class\u2026 It is therefore inaccurate to say the Family Class is unidentifiable\u201d (Order under Appeal at para. 37).\n[21] As a result, the certification judge reinstated the Family Class as part of the class definition.\nIV. Standard of Review [22] The standards of review applicable to an appeal from a decision of the Federal Court are those set out in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235: palpable and overriding error for questions of fact, and correctness for questions of law. For questions of mixed fact and law, correctness will apply to any extricable question of law, otherwise the standard of palpable and overriding error will apply.\nV. Issues [23] This appeal raises the following issues:\nDid the certification judge err in her application of Rule 334.19? Did the certification judge err in her application of the doctrines of issue estoppel and functus officio?\nVI. Analysis A. Did the certification judge err in her application of Rule 334.19? [24] In the Order under Appeal, the certification judge ruled at the outset of her analysis that the wording of Rule 334.19 \u201cprovides the Court with the necessary jurisdiction and discretion to consider this Motion\u201d (Order under Appeal at para. 13).\n[25] Rule 334.19 provides that:\nAmendment and decertification\nModification ou retrait de l\u2019ordonnance\n334.19 A judge may, on motion, amend an order certifying a proceeding as a class proceeding or, if the conditions for certification are no longer satisfied with respect to the proceeding, decertify it.\n334.19 Le juge peut, sur requ\u00eate, modifier l\u2019ordonnance d\u2019autorisation ou, si les conditions d\u2019autorisation ne sont plus respect\u00e9es, retirer l\u2019autorisation\n[26] As such, the certification judge relied on Rule 334.19 to conclude that it was not necessary to consider whether the proposed Family Class met the requirements for certification since she had already done so in Greenwood FC.\n[27] It is a given that had the respondents moved to vary the certification order to restore the Family Class before this Court\u2019s decision in Greenwood FCA, it would have been open to the certification judge to reinstate the Family Class on the basis of her findings and analysis with respect to the initial certification motion.\n[28] However, the situation before the certification judge was different. Indeed, the respondents\u2019 motion to reinstate the Family Class was brought after this Court issued its judgment in Greenwood FCA.\n[29] In Greenwood FCA, this Court partially reversed Greenwood FC, finding that the certification judge had erred in her application of the \u201csome basis in fact\u201d requirement with regard to the evidence on record (Greenwood FCA at paras 128\u201339, 165\u201375). This Court indicated as follows in this regard (ibid. at paras 167, 169):\n[A] motion judge must be satisfied that there is some basis in fact for the final four criteria for certification. If there was no evidence before a motion judge that is capable of supporting a determination that there is some basis in fact for these criteria, the certification order will be tainted by palpable and overriding error and may be set aside.\n\u2026\nWhile the \u201csome basis in fact\u201d requirement establishes a lesser standard than the balance of probabilities, a plaintiff is nonetheless required to set out a factual underpinning to support the existence of claims on behalf of class members\u2026\n[30] In restoring the Family Class as part of the class definition, the certification judge overlooked this Court\u2019s ruling in Greenwood FCA.\n[31] Indeed, the class definition considered in Greenwood FCA was the definition that formed part of the April 2020 Order, which is the Order that did not include the Family Class. The Family Class issue was not before our Court in Greenwood FCA, as the certification judge acknowledged herself (Order under Appeal at para. 17). Although our Court in Greenwood FCA did refer to the Family Class at paragraphs 5 and 14, it merely did so in reference to the respondents\u2019 statement of claim. As such, it cannot be alleged that our Court considered the issue of whether there was \u201csome basis in fact\u201d for the certification of the Family Class as part of the class definition. The certification judge accordingly erred in relying on those paragraphs from Greenwood FCA to conclude that our Court has somehow endorsed her analysis with respect to the Family Class (Order under Appeal at para. 34). To the contrary, the reasoning in Greenwood FCA required the certification judge to perform an analysis and reconsider whether the Family Class met the criteria for certification in light of the guidance provided by our Court.\n[32] The decision in Greenwood FCA provided the basis for the certification judge to exercise her discretion and reconsider the Family Class in ruling on the respondents\u2019 motion to vary. Specifically, given the circumstances, she had the obligation to revisit the Family Class with a view to determine whether there was \u201csome basis in fact\u201d in the evidentiary record to support its inclusion as part of the class definition. It was not open to the certification judge to simply reinstate her initial findings after having been overturned by this Court. The reinstatement of the Family Class in the certification order, absent a \u201csome basis in fact\u201d analysis conducted consistently with the guidance set forth by this Court in Greenwood FCA, amounts to an error of law.\n[33] The certification judge\u2019s error in her application of Rule 334.19 is sufficient to dispose of this appeal. The doctrines of estoppel and functus officio are not determinative of this appeal and the appellant conceded that, \u201cin the circumstances of this case, it would be open to the Court to depart from a strict application of those doctrines\u201d (Memorandum of fact and law of the Appellant at para. 62).\n[34] However, the certification judge suggested that, as a matter of principle, issue estoppel and functus officio never apply to procedural motions like certification motions. In my view, this was a further error that our Court is required to address.\nB. Did the certification judge err in her application of the doctrine of issue estoppel and functus officio? (1) Issue estoppel [35] Issue estoppel is a common law doctrine that provides that once a judicial proceeding finally decides an issue, neither party can re-litigate that issue. The doctrine rests on the finality principle. As aptly summarized by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Smith Estate v National Money Mart Company, 2008 ONCA 746, 303 DLR (4th) 175 at para. 33: \u201c[o]nce a point has been decided, the winning litigant is entitled to rely on the result, to be assured of peace and to be able to plan the future on the basis of the court\u2019s decision.\u201d The doctrine also exists to preserve scare judicial resources and prevent parties from exposure to additional legal costs, as well as to reduce the risk of undue litigation (Penner v. Niagara (Regional Police Services Board), 2013 SCC 19, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 125 at para. 28).\n[36] It is well established that issue estoppel emerges in the presence of three preconditions (Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., 2001 SCC 44, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 460 at para. 25 (Danyluk)):\n(1) the same question has been decided;\n(2) the judicial decision which is said to create the estoppel was final; and,\n(3) the parties to the judicial decision or their privies were the same persons as the parties to the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised or their privies.\n[37] Furthermore, even if all the preconditions are established, a judge will retain a broad discretion to refuse to apply the doctrine of issue estoppel if its application were to create an injustice (Danyluk at para. 33):\nThe first step is to determine whether the moving party \u2026 has established the preconditions to the operation of issue estoppel \u2026 If successful, the court must still determine whether, as a matter of discretion, issue estoppel ought to be applied \u2026 [emphasis in original]\n[38] In the present case, and I agree with the appellant on this point, the certification judge conflated whether the issue at hand was finally resolved with whether the entirety of the claim was finally determined. She did so in a cursory manner, without reference to the relevant case law.\n[39] Indeed, there are decisions stating that the doctrine of issue estoppel applies to interlocutory orders (Hawley v. North Shore Mercantile Corp., 2009 ONCA 679, 99 O.R. (3d) 142 at para. 26, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 33440 (April 22 2010), citing Fidelitas Shipping Co. v. V\/O Exportchieb, [1965] 2 All E.R. 4 at 10 (CA UK); see also R. v. Duhamel, 1981 ABCA 295 at para. 14, aff\u2019d [1984] 2 S.C.R. 555). More particularly, in the context of class proceedings, a number of decisions confirm that issue estoppel applies to class certification motions with the understanding that judges retain discretion not to apply it when they are of the view it would lead to an injustice (see Risorto v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., [2009] O.J. No. 820, 72 C.C.L.I. (4th) 60 at para. 49; Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd. v. Microsoft Corporation, 2014 BCSC 1280, 376 D.L.R. (4th) 302 at paras 28\u201330, 60, 78 (Pro-Sys); Turner v. York University, 2011 ONSC 6151, 209 A.C.W.S. (3d) 228 at paras 63\u201365; Corless v. Bell Mobility Inc., 2023 ONSC 6227 at paras 51\u201358 (Corless); Fanshawe College of Applied Arts and Technology v. LG Philips LCD Co., 2016 ONSC 3958, 270 A.C.W.S. (3d) 23 at paras 43\u201353).\n[40] While certification orders do not dispose of the entire proceeding, they may yield final rulings on issues going to the merits of the case, such as class definitions and common questions. As it was put by our Court in Apotex Inc. v. Merck & Co. (C.A.), 2002 FCA 210, [2003] 1 F.C. 242 at para. 27:\nThe decision which is said to give rise to the estoppel need not be a decision which determines the entire subject-matter of the litigation. The test for issue estoppel is a substantive issue test where the decision affects substantive rights of the parties with respect to a matter bearing on the merits of the cause of action.\n[41] Accordingly, certification orders issued in the context of class proceedings may be subject to issue estoppel. Although Rule 334.19 contemplates the possibility of amending a certification order, it does not displace the doctrine of issue estoppel that exists to prevent re-litigation. Both the rule and the doctrine have to be taken into account and the judge\u2019s discretion has to be exercised consequently and appropriately (Pro-Sys at para. 28). Any other approach would undermine judicial economy (which the doctrine of issue estoppel fundamentally seeks to protect) by allowing litigants to repeatedly and endlessly re-open certification orders.\n[42] That being said, there are circumstances where the doctrine of issue estoppel can be set aside, namely in the event of an appeal, a material change in circumstances, or new evidence (Donald J. Lange, The Doctrine of Res Judicata in Canada, 5th ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis, 2021) at 328).\n[43] In the present case, prior to Greenwood FCA, it would have been open to the respondents to move to vary the certification order to reinstate the Family Class, as the certification judge remained bound by her previous Family Class findings. However, from the moment this Court issued its judgment in Greenwood FCA and partially reversed the certification judge, issue estoppel ceased to apply by virtue of the appeal exception. As of that moment, and for reasons that differ from those of the certification judge, the Family Class was no longer barred by issue estoppel as the analysis grounding its inclusion in the class definition was no longer valid.\n(2) Functus officio\n[44] Simply put, the functus officio doctrine provides that once a matter is finally ruled upon, the judge has discharged its office and cannot re-open the matter. Indeed, to do so would impede on \u201corderly appellate procedure\u201d (Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Manitoba, 2021 SCC 33, 461 D.L.R. (4th) 635 at para. 34).\n[45] In the Order under Appeal, the certification judge found that the doctrine of functus officio could not apply, as certification orders do not involve final findings on the merits of the case. This conclusion stems from the certification judge\u2019s same misunderstanding regarding the meaning of \u201cfinal\u201d in the context of the doctrine of issue estoppel. As explained in these reasons, certification orders can be considered final orders for the purpose of class proceedings, and it follows that the doctrine of functus officio can accordingly be applied to certification orders.\nVII. Proposed disposition [46] I would allow the appeal, set aside the Order of the Federal Court (2023 FC 397) and remit the question of the Family Class to the certification judge. The certification judge should provide an analysis and revisit the \u201csome basis in fact\u201d requirement for the certification of the Family Class. In the event that the certification judge determines that the Family Class should be certified, she should also thoroughly examine the workability of its definition.\n[47] In accordance with Rule 334.39, I would make no order as to costs.\n\"Richard Boivin\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nMary J.L.

The two are identical, there being no confidential information disclosed in the confidential reasons.\nLOCKE J.A.\nI. Background [1] This is an appeal of a decision of the Federal Court (2022 FC 1218, per Justice Michael D. Manson) in the context of an action brought pursuant to subsection 6(1) of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations, S.O.R.\/93-133. In that action, the respondents, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. (collectively, Janssen), sought a declaration that the appellant, Pharmascience Inc. (Pharmascience), would infringe Canadian Patent No. 2,655,335 (the 335 Patent) if it were to make, use or sell its generic version of Janssen\u2019s patented medicine called INVEGA SUSTENNA.\n[2] INVEGA SUSTENNA involves a suspension of paliperidone palmitate for the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders. The 335 Patent teaches a regimen to achieve an optimum plasma concentration-time profile. It teaches a first loading dose administered in the deltoid muscle on day 1, a second loading dose administered in the deltoid muscle on day 8, and then monthly maintenance doses thereafter administered either in the deltoid or gluteal muscle. For non-renally impaired patients, the first and second loading doses are 150 and 100 mg equivalent (mg-eq.), respectively, and the monthly maintenance doses are 75 mg-eq. each. For renally impaired patients, the first and second loading doses are 100 and 75 mg-eq., respectively, and the monthly maintenance doses are 50 mg-eq. each.\n[3] Pharmascience defended against Janssen\u2019s action on a number of grounds. The only ground that remains relevant for the purposes of this appeal is that the claims of the 335 Patent are invalid because they comprise unpatentable subject matter, namely methods of medical treatment. The Federal Court rejected this allegation and found the claims of the 335 Patent valid.\n[4] It will be necessary in this decision to explore somewhat the history and nature of the prohibition against patenting methods of medical treatment. For the reasons set out below, I would dismiss the present appeal.\nII. The Federal Court\u2019s Decision [5] The Federal Court addressed the question of methods of medical treatment at paragraphs 160 to 172 of its reasons.\n[6] After noting that the prohibition against patenting methods of medical treatment has its origin in the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Tennessee Eastman Co. v. Commissioner of Patents, [1974] S.C.R. 111, 33 D.L.R. (3d) 459 (Tennessee Eastman), and then observing that the jurisprudence in this area is inconsistent, the Federal Court stated that the starting point is to ask, \u201cwhat do the claims say?\u201d (see paragraph 161 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons, citing Bayer Inc. v. Cobalt Pharmaceuticals Company, 2013 FC 1061, 121 C.P.R. (4th) 14 at para. 162 (Bayer)).\n[7] The Federal Court then considered Pharmascience\u2019s argument that the dosage range for the maintenance dose (from 25 to 150 mg-eq., according to the product monograph for INVEGA SUSTENNA) indicates that no particular dose will work for every patient, and that selection of the appropriate dose for a specific patient will require skill and judgment from the prescriber.\n[8] The Federal Court noted that it is well settled that claims to a vendible product are not prohibited as methods of medical treatment. It went on to conclude that the method of medical treatment analysis was relevant only to use claims, which it identified as claims 17 to 32 of the 335 Patent (use of a dosage form), and not to the product claims, which it identified as claims 1 to 16 (pre-filled syringes), claims 33 to 48 (how a medicament is prepared), and claims 49 to 63 (a dosage form).\n[9] At paragraph 164 of its reasons, the Federal Court noted that the focus should be on whether professional skill and judgment are required to practise the claimed invention, and cited jurisprudence to the effect that:\nclaims restricted to particular dosages and specific administration schedules have been found to be patentable subject matter, where the amounts and timing are fixed \u2026 whereas claims to dosages or schedules with ranges within which the physician must exercise skill and judgment have been found to not be a vendible product and thus not patentable [references omitted].\n[10] However, the Federal Court also noted that the dichotomy it described (between fixed and variable dosages and schedules) has a questionable underpinning. On this point, it cited the following passage from this Court\u2019s decision in Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research, 2020 FCA 30, 316 A.C.W.S. (3d) 537 at para. 52 (Hospira):\nThis state of the jurisprudence has a tempting simplicity. However, it is not clear to me that the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada that form the basis of the principle that methods of medical treatment are not patentable justify a distinction between a fixed dosage (or interval of administration) and a range of dosages (or intervals). It would seem that a medical professional will be constrained in their exercise of skill in either case. Also, a drug is arguably no less a vendible product simply because its dosage or interval of administration is not fixed.\n[11] The Federal Court found that claims 17 to 32 of the 335 Patent do not require professional skill and judgment because there are no choices to make on dosage amounts, which are all fixed. It found that choices concerning dosing windows and injection sites had no clinical implications, and hence did not interfere with a physician\u2019s skill and judgment. The Federal Court noted that a physician could choose whether to prescribe the claimed dosing regimen, but no skill or judgment was involved in implementing it.\n[12] The Federal Court concluded that the 335 Patent discloses patentable subject matter.\nIII. Issues [13] Pharmascience argues that the Federal Court erred in law in two respects:\nIn excluding claims 1 to 16 and 33 to 63 of the 335 Patent from the method of medical treatment analysis on the basis that they concern a vendible product; and\nIn determining that the claims in issue are patentable on the basis of the dichotomy between fixed and variable dosing regimens.\n[14] I will address each of these arguments in turn after first discussing the key jurisprudence on the method of medical treatment exclusion.\nIV. Standard of Review [15] The parties agree that the standard of review applicable in this case is as set out in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. Questions of law are reviewed on a standard of correctness, and questions of fact or of mixed fact and law from which no question of law is extricable are reviewed on a standard of palpable and overriding error. A palpable error is one that is obvious. An overriding error is one that goes to the very core of the outcome of the case. When arguing palpable and overriding error, it is not enough to pull at leaves and branches and leave the tree standing. The entire tree must fall: Canada v. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 FCA 165, [2012] F.C.J. No. 669 at para. 46 (cited with approval in Benhaim v. St-Germain, 2016 SCC 48, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 352 at para. 38).\n[16] Pharmascience describes all of the questions in dispute as being questions of law subject to the standard of correctness. Pharmascience does not argue that the Federal Court made any errors that are subject to the palpable and overriding error standard. I accept Pharmascience\u2019s approach.\nV. Analysis A. Jurisprudence concerning the prohibition on patenting methods of medical treatment [17] The Patent Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, contains no explicit prohibition against claims for methods of medical treatment. Moreover, subsection 43(2) of the Patent Act provides that a patent is presumed valid. Claims are presumed not to concern methods of medical treatment, and the burden rests on the challenger (Pharmascience, in this case) to prove otherwise.\n[18] As indicated above, the origin of this prohibition in Canada is the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s 1974 decision in Tennessee Eastman. That case involved an attempt to obtain a patent claiming a surgical method for joining or bonding the surfaces of incisions or wounds in living animal tissue by applying adhesive compounds described in the claims in a liquid state, directly to at least one of the tissue surfaces to be bonded. At the time, subsection 41(1) of the Patent Act generally prohibited claims to \u201csubstances prepared or produced by chemical processes and intended for food or medicine\u201d. Therefore, the bonding compounds of the patent application in question could not be claimed as such.\n[19] The Supreme Court maintained the rejection of the patent application by the Commissioner of Patents. Its analysis surrounded the definition of \u201cinvention\u201d in the Patent Act. At page 118, the Court wrote:\nIt is clear that a new substance that is useful in the medical or surgical treatment of humans or of animals is an \u201cinvention\u201d. It is equally clear that a process for making such a substance also is an \u201cinvention\u201d. In fact, the substance can be claimed as an invention only \u201cwhen prepared or produced by\u201d such a process. But what of the method of medical or surgical treatment using the new substance? Can it too be claimed as an invention? In order to establish the utility of the substance this has to be defined to a certain extent. In the case of a drug, the desirable effects must be ascertained as well as the undesirable side effects. The proper doses have to be found as well as methods of administration and any counter\u2011indications. May these therapeutic data be claimed in themselves as a separate invention consisting in a method of treatment embodying the use of the new drug? I do not think so, and it appears to me that s. 41 definitely indicates that it is not so.\n[20] At page 119, the Court added, \u201c[h]aving come to the conclusion that methods of medical treatment are not contemplated in the definition of \u201cinvention\u201d as a kind of \u201cprocess\u201d, the same must, on the same basis, be true of a method of surgical treatment.\u201d\n[21] The Supreme Court of Canada had occasion to comment on Tennessee Eastman in its later decision in Shell Oil Co. v. Commissioner of Patents, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 536, 142 D.L.R. (3d) 117 at 554 (Shell Oil):\nIn Tennessee Eastman Co. v. Commissioner of Patents (1970), 62 C.P.R. 117 (Ex. Ct.), aff\u2019d [1974] S.C.R. 111, the applicant sought a patent on a method of closing incisions following surgery by the use of an adhesive substance discovered to have a marked affinity for adhering to living tissue. The Commissioner refused the patent on the basis that this was not the kind of discovery (the adhesive itself not being new) which fell within the definition of \u201cinvention\u201d in the Act. In particular, he found that it was not an \u201cart\u201d because it was useful only in the process of surgical or medical treatment and produced no result in relation to trade, commerce or industry. The applicant appealed to the Exchequer Court and the issue there was limited to the question whether this use of the adhesive fell within the meaning of new and useful \u201cart\u201d or \u201cprocess\u201d within the meaning of the Patent Act. It was held that it did not for the reasons given by the Commissioner. In effect, it was not patentable because it was essentially non-economic and unrelated to trade, industry or commerce. It was related rather to the area of professional skills.\n[22] The explicit prohibition in subsection 41(1) of the Patent Act against patent claims to \u201csubstances prepared or produced by chemical processes and intended for food or medicine\u201d was later lifted by the repeal of this provision. However, that change did not have the effect of removing the prohibition on patenting methods of medical treatment. The Supreme Court of Canada effectively confirmed this in its comments on Tennessee Eastman in Apotex Inc. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd., 2002 SCC 77, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 153 at para. 49 (Wellcome), where it cited the explanation in Shell Oil that a claim to a method of medical treatment is unpatentable because it is \u201cessentially non-economic and unrelated to trade, industry, or commerce\u201d and \u201crelated rather to the area of professional skills\u201d.\n[23] Wellcome concerned a patent on the use of AZT as a treatment for HIV. The Court found that the patent did not concern a method of medical treatment, stating as follows at paragraph 50:\nThe AZT patent does not seek to \u201cfence in\u201d an area of medical treatment. It seeks the exclusive right to provide AZT as a commercial offering. How and when, if at all, AZT is employed is left to the professional skill and judgment of the medical profession.\n[24] Tennessee Eastman, Shell Oil, and Wellcome are Supreme Court of Canada decisions by which this Court is clearly bound. It is important to keep in mind what they say, and what they do not say. What they say is that a method of medical treatment is not patentable because it does not fall within the definition of \u201cinvention\u201d as contemplated in the Patent Act. This is because a method of medical treatment is unrelated to trade, industry or commerce, and concerns professional skills that are non-economic. A patent should not seek to fence in the exercise of such skills (including how and when a drug is administered), but it may cover a commercial offering.\n[25] The development of the jurisprudence beyond what is discussed in the foregoing Supreme Court decisions (what they do not say) is not equally binding on this Court, although this Court should follow its own decisions unless they are manifestly wrong: Miller v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 FCA 370, 220 DLR (4th) 149 at para. 10. I will now explore that jurisprudence and discuss the principles that properly arise therefrom.\n[26] The references to \u201ctrade, industry or commerce\u201d and \u201ccommercial offering\u201d by the Supreme Court appear to be the basis for the focus of many decisions on whether the invention concerns a \u201cvendible product\u201d: see Hospira at para. 53 as well as the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Wellcome ([2000] F.C.J. No. 1770, 10 C.P.R. (4th) 65 at para. 74). This focus is also discussed in the following Federal Court decisions: Merck & Co., Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2005 FC 755, 41 C.P.R. (4th) 35 at paras. 136\u201337; Merck & Co., Inc. v. Pharmascience Inc., 2010 FC 510, 85 C.P.R. (4th) 179 at paras. 110, 114 (Merck 2010); Janssen Inc. v. Mylan Pharmaceuticals ULC, 2010 FC 1123, 88 C.P.R. (4th) 359 at para. 53 (Mylan); Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. v. Cobalt Pharmaceuticals Company, 2013 FC 985 at paras. 78, 91, 98, aff\u2019d 2014 FCA 17, 236 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1001 (Novartis); Bayer at para. 162; Abbvie Biotechnology Ltd. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2014 FC 1251, 248 A.C.W.S. (3d) at paras. 115, 125 (Abbvie); and Biogen Canada Inc. v. Taro Pharmaceuticals Inc., 2020 FC 621, [2020] F.C.J. No. 611 at para. 211. The idea, with which I agree, is that a vendible product has economic value and is distinguishable from the skilled work of a physician, and hence outside the realm of methods of medical treatment as contemplated by the Supreme Court of Canada.\n[27] With regard to inventions relating to the administration of a drug, the jurisprudence at the Federal Court level has developed an approach whereby a claim may be found to be either patentable subject matter or an unpatentable method of medical treatment based on whether it defines a fixed dosage (or interval of administration) or a range of dosages (or intervals). This approach appears to have its origin in Axcan Pharma Inc. v. Pharmascience Inc., 2006 FC 527, 50 C.P.R. (4th) 321 at paragraphs 45\u201351 (Axcan), and was developed in Merck 2010 at paragraphs 111\u201314, and Novartis at paragraphs 82\u201399.\n[28] As indicated in the passage from Hospira quoted at paragraph 10 above, the distinction between fixed and variable dosages (or schedules) has a questionable underpinning, since such a distinction would seem to make no difference to whether the drug in question is a vendible product. However, the distinction makes more sense if one bears in mind the guidance noted in paragraph 6 above from Bayer that what matters is what the claims say; the product that the patentee puts on the market is incidental. In my view, it is permissible to focus on whether the dosing regimen is fixed or variable provided that the analysis remains tied to the ultimate question of whether professional skill is applied in using the invention. This was reflected in Mylan, which noted the concern in Axcan and Merck 2010 about dosage ranges, and then stated as follows at paragraph 26:\nWhat I take from the above authorities is that a patent claim over a method of medical treatment that, by its nature, covers an area for which a physician\u2019s skill or judgment is expected to be exercised is not patentable in Canada. This would include the administration of a drug whereby the physician, while relying upon the dosage advice of the patentee, would still be expected to be alert and responsive to a patient\u2019s profile and to the patient\u2019s reaction to the compound.\n[29] The Federal Court in Mylan at paragraph 4 noted that \u201cthe inventive concept of the [patent in suit] is limited to Janssen\u2019s claimed discovery that the slow titration of galantamine improved patient tolerability for the drug, by reducing side-effects and resulted in the ability to use a lower maintenance dose than had previously been shown to be effective.\u201d The Court found that the claims in issue concerned an unpatentable method of medical treatment because they defined a \u201ctitration regimen\u201d (see paragraph 50) that required the ongoing exercise of a physician\u2019s professional skill and judgment. The monopoly asserted by the claims would thereby interfere with the ability of a physician to exercise that skill and judgment.\n[30] Despite this, I think it would go too far to say that any drug regimen that requires a physician to monitor a patient is unpatentable. Such a prohibition would cast too wide a net, potentially encompassing almost any drug.\n[31] In Abbvie, the Federal Court provided a detailed review of the jurisprudence concerning methods of medical treatment. At paragraphs 110 and 121, the Court distinguished, properly in my view, between the exercise of skill and judgment in deciding whether to use a claimed invention (which does not indicate a method of medical treatment), and the exercise of skill and judgment in deciding how to use the invention (which is a prohibited method of medical treatment).\n[32] As in Mylan, Abbvie cautioned against a simple distinction between fixed and variable dosages and schedules. Paragraphs 112 to 114 stated as follows:\n[112] The respondent cautioned against relying on catch phrases rather than principles. In my view, the jurisprudence reflects that approach \u2013 the principle has been applied regardless of the Courts\u2019 references to \u201cfencing in\u201d or to \u201cfixed dosages\u201d. The issue in every case has been whether the patent claims a method of medical treatment. In applying the same principles, claims to fixed dosages and schedules which do not involve any professional decision-making have been accepted as patentable.\n[113] However, just because the claims involve a fixed dosage and schedule does not mean that they are automatically patentable, nor does it mean that they constitute unpatentable subject matter. The fixed dosage and schedule may be a good signal or starting point, but the evidence about that claimed dosage regime and schedule may indicate that it is not exactly as it is claimed and that adjustments are needed which requires skill and judgment.\n[114] The review of the relevant case law supports the appellants\u2019 understanding of the principles from the jurisprudence and demonstrates that the Courts have consistently found that a claim directed to the exercise of professional skill or judgment is not patentable. However, a claim which does not restrict, or interfere with, or otherwise engage professional skill or judgment \u2013 including a claim for a fixed dosage and or a fixed dosage schedule or interval \u2013 is not impermissible subject matter where there is no evidence to contradict that claimed dosage. Contrary to the Commissioner\u2019s decision and the respondent\u2019s position, [Mylan] has not changed the law.\n[33] Pharmascience argues that the concern in Abbvie about evidence that could contradict a fixed claimed dosage or schedule is directed to cases in which the dosage or schedule in question may not be effective for all patients such that a physician would have to exercise skill and judgment in some cases in determining an appropriate dosage. Pharmascience argues that a claimed dosage regimen that will not be appropriate for all patients constitutes an unpatentable method of medical treatment. As support for this argument, Pharmascience notes the following passage from Abbvie at paragraph 121:\nIn the present case, the physician\u2019s skill is not expected to be exercised within the claim. The prescribing practices are not restricted. The physician must exercise skill and judgment to determine if the claimed use is appropriate for the patient. The physician decides to prescribe it as is or not at all. If prescribed, there would be no restriction on the exercise of skill or judgment. The evidence is that this dosage with the bi-weekly interval is appropriate for all those to whom it is administered.\n[34] I do not understand Abbvie to exclude as prohibited methods of medical treatment all patent claims to a dosing regimen that may not work for all patients. Such a rigid approach would be inconsistent with the jurisprudence. In practice, I would expect that few drug regimens could be anticipated to be effective for all patients at a particular dosage. In my view, Abbvie was properly focused on whether it was expected that professional skill and judgment would be required in using the patented invention. In that case, the Court found no evidence to that effect (see paragraph 111).\n[35] The Federal Court reached the opposite result in Hoffmann-La Roche Limited v. Sandoz Canada Inc., 2021 FC 384, 185 C.P.R. (4th) 167 (Hoffmann). There, the Court found at paragraph 204 that \u201cthe evidence has established that there is a continued need for a physician\u2019s exercise of skill and judgement\u201d. Clearly, this issue is factually suffused; it depends on the evidence and it concerns how the patented invention is intended to be used.\n[36] Another possible wrinkle seems to arise in Novartis. In finding the claims of the patent in suit invalid, the Federal Court there noted at paragraph 99 that the claims included \u201ctreatment by intermittent dosages with some claims specifying a dosage range and others specifying specific dosages; and some claims claiming more frequent intervals of dosing, and others less\u201d. The Federal Court continued that the claims therefore included \u201cthat which lies within the skill of the medical practitioner\u201d. This reasoning suggests that the Court in Novartis may have been concerned that, even though some individual claims provided a fixed dosage and schedule, the claims of the patent taken together covered a range of possible dosages or schedules, such that use of the patented invention as claimed effectively required the exercise of skill and judgment. Though preceding paragraphs of that decision discussed variability in the frequency of the intermittent doses (in the disclosure portion of the patent), such variability within any particular claim is not discussed in paragraph 99.\n[37] To summarize, whether or not a patent claim to a dosing regimen relates to a method of medical treatment cannot be based exclusively on whether its dosing and schedule is fixed or not. The proper inquiry remains whether use of the invention (i.e., how to use it, not whether to use it) requires the exercise of skill and judgment, and the burden remains on the party challenging the patent. It is difficult to provide more detailed guidance than this for parties involved in future litigation and courts faced with allegations of invalidity of patent claims due to unpatentable subject matter, namely methods of medical treatment. Such allegations will generally turn on the particulars of the case and the evidence on the record.\nB. Issue 1: Whether claims 1 to 16 and 33 to 63 should have been subject to method of medical treatment analysis [38] At paragraph 34 of its reasons, the Federal Court divided the claims of the 335 Patent into four sets:\ni. Claims 1 to 16 relate to prefilled syringes adapted for administration according to the claimed dosing regimens;\nii. Claims 17 to 32 relate to a use of a \u201cdosage form\u201d according to the claimed dosing regimens;\niii. Claims 33 to 48 relate to use of paliperidone as paliperidone palmitate in the manufacture\/preparation of a \u201cmedicament\u201d adapted for administration according to the claimed dosing regimen; and\niv. Claims 49 to 63 relate to a \u201cdosage form\u201d adapted for administration according to the claimed dosage regimens.\n[39] At paragraph 163, the Federal Court found all of the claims except 17 to 32 (the other claims) to be product claims, and not methods of medical treatment.\n[40] Pharmascience argues that the Federal Court erred in concluding on this basis. It argues that the other claims do not concern a mere product (pre-filled syringes or a dosage form), but rather a dosing regimen involving ongoing maintenance dosing. Pharmascience argues that these claims should not have been excluded from the method of medical treatment analysis.\n[41] In my view, the Federal Court did not err in law in finding that the other claims did not define methods of medical treatment because they were product claims. It is not in dispute that a vendible product is not a method of medical treatment. Therefore, the issue is really whether the Federal Court erred in finding that the other claims are for a vendible product. In my view, a claim may concern a vendible product even if it includes a dosing regimen as an essential element.\n[42] The Federal Court specifically indicated its conclusions that the other claims are product claims at paragraphs 99, 109 and 111 of its reasons. I am not convinced that the Federal Court made any error in this regard. Claims 1 to 16 concern pre-filled syringes, which are clearly vendible products. Claims 33 to 48 concern the use of paliperidone, but in preparation of a medicament, which is also a vendible product. Finally, claims 49 to 63 concern a dosage form, which once again is a vendible product. I see no reason to interfere with the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that these are not claims to methods of medical treatment. I acknowledge Pharmascience\u2019s argument that it would be an error to focus on form over substance, but I see nothing in the substance of these claims that is inconsistent with their form as claims to vendible products.\n[43] I also do not accept Pharmascience\u2019s assertion that these claims were excluded from the method of medical treatment analysis. Even though the Federal Court suggests as much in paragraph 163 of its reasons, I am of the view that it did in fact consider these claims and it found that they related to a vendible product and were therefore patentable subject matter. In any case, the Federal Court\u2019s method of medical treatment analysis in relation to claims 17 to 32 of the 335 Patent would apply equally to the other claims.\nC. Issue 2: Whether the Federal Court erred in finding that the claims in issue are patentable on the basis of the dichotomy between fixed and variable dosing regimens [44] There are two aspects to Pharmascience\u2019s argument on this issue. First, Pharmascience argues that the Federal Court erred in describing the relevance of fixed or variable dosing regimens to the issue of method of medical treatment. Second, Pharmascience argues that the Federal Court erred in characterizing claims 17 to 32 of the 335 Patent as defining fixed dosages and schedules. I will address these two aspects separately.\n(1) Relevance of fixed or variable dosing [45] I have discussed the jurisprudence relevant to this aspect of issue 2 at paragraphs 27 to 37 above. In light of that discussion, the Federal Court\u2019s description of the law as it relates to fixed dosages and schedules at paragraph 164 of its reasons (see quote at paragraph 9 above) is incomplete. The question of patentable subject matter does not necessarily turn simply on whether the claim in question is limited to a fixed dosage and schedule. Rather, the proper question is whether professional skill and judgment would be required in using the patented invention. Though a fixed dosage and schedule may be a good indication that no such skill and judgment would be required, evidence may indicate otherwise.\n[46] Pharmascience also draws the Court\u2019s attention to paragraph 167 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons:\nAs Pharmascience\u2019s expert Dr. Jeffries agreed, claims 17-32 do not prevent physicians from practicing in a manner they had previously \u201cbecause they weren\u2019t doing anything before\u201d the 335 Patent with paliperidone palmitate to treat schizophrenia.\n[47] I am inclined to agree with Pharmascience that this observation may be relevant to the issue of obviousness, but it is not relevant to whether the claims in question define patentable subject matter.\n[48] Despite this, I do not see either paragraph 164 or 167 as representing a reviewable error. I read paragraph 167 as an aside that was unnecessary to the Federal Court\u2019s decision. With regard to paragraph 164 and the Federal Court\u2019s failure to acknowledge the potential relevance of evidence that contradicts the fixed nature of the claimed dosing and schedule, I am satisfied that it made no difference to the result. Firstly, the same judge (Justice Manson) was aware of this precise issue, having considered it just the year before in Hoffmann at paragraph 202. Secondly, as discussed below in relation to the second aspect of this issue, Pharmascience has not convinced me that any evidence on the record was sufficient to contradict the fixed nature of the dosing and schedule claimed in the 335 Patent. It would have been preferable for the Federal Court to have acknowledged this nuance in the legal test, but I do not see this omission as a reviewable error.\n[49] At paragraphs 168 to 171 of its reasons, the Federal Court properly focused on whether use of the claims required the exercise of skill and judgment. At paragraph 171, the Federal Court properly recognized the distinction between the exercise of skill and judgment in deciding whether to use the invention, and the exercise of skill and judgment in deciding how to use the invention.\n(2) Characterization of claims 17 to 32 as defining fixed dosages and schedules [50] Pharmascience points to paragraph 162 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons as an acknowledgement that different dosages may be required for different patients, and therefore the 335 Patent does not define a fixed dosage regimen. Pharmascience argues that the patented regimen is not \u201cone size fits all\u201d, and therefore it constitutes a method of medical treatment. As indicated above in discussion of Abbvie, I do not accept the fact that a fixed dosage may not work for some patients as sufficient to conclude that the invention is an unpatentable method of medical treatment. As indicated several times already in these reasons, the proper question is whether skill and judgment is required to use the invention.\n[51] Pharmascience also cites various elements of the claims of the 335 Patent as instances of variability in dosing and scheduling that require a conclusion that the invention is not limited to a fixed dosage and schedule. One example is the window provided in claims 17 to 32 for the second loading dose (\u201cone week \u00b1 2 days after the first loading dose\u201d) and for the maintenance doses (\u201cmonthly \u00b1 7 days dosing interval after the second loading dose\u201d). Pharmascience argues that the claims therefore effectively call for the second dose in a range from day 6 to day 10, and the maintenance dose in a range from 23 to 37 days after the second dose.\n[52] The Federal Court acknowledged this argument at paragraph 170 of its reasons, but found that these choices have no clinical implications, and are there to allow flexibility in administering the drug. The Court concluded based on this that the claims do not interfere with a physician\u2019s exercise of skill and judgment. I see no legal error here, and Pharmascience does not assert any palpable and overriding error of fact or of mixed fact and law. In Wellcome, claims that defined the intended dosage as \u201can effective amount\u201d were held to be patentable subject matter despite the fact that they clearly contemplated some variability.\n[53] Pharmascience makes a similar argument regarding flexibility as to the location for injection of the monthly maintenance dose, which may be in \u201ca deltoid or a gluteal muscle\u201d. The Federal Court reached the same conclusion, which was open to it, that this choice has no clinical implications and does not interfere with a physician\u2019s exercise of skill and judgment.\n[54] Pharmascience also argues that the disclosure portion of the 335 Patent indicates that physicians are intended to exercise skill and judgment in using the invention. It points specifically to the following passage at page 12, lines 23 to 25 thereof:\nThose of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the maintenance dose may be titrated up or down in view of patients condition (response to the medication and renal function).\n[55] Titration has been cited in the jurisprudence as a basis for concluding that use of an invention requires skill and judgment: see Mylan and Hoffmann. But in my view, this sentence is insufficient to find a reviewable error in this case. While the Federal Court was required to consider the implications of this sentence as part of its review of the 335 Patent as a whole, it is not of such a nature as to require the Federal Court to conclude that use of the claimed invention demands the exercise of skill and judgment. Once again, I see no legal error here, and Pharmascience does not assert any palpable and overriding error of fact or of mixed fact and law.\n[56] Another potential argument of variability in the 335 Patent is the difference between dosing for patients with renal impairment and dosing for those without. However, it appears that this is an objective distinction that does not involve the exercise of a physician\u2019s skill and judgment. Rather, it reflects the fact that a different intended dosage regimen applies for patients with renal impairment.\nD. Scope of injunction [57] A final issue that was raised as an alternative argument in Pharmascience\u2019s memorandum of fact and law concerns the scope of the injunction that was granted by the Federal Court in its judgment. This issue was not addressed orally at the hearing of this appeal, but it also was not given up.\n[58] Pharmascience argues that the injunction is too broad, in that it covers activities that are outside the scope of the exclusive rights for a patent enumerated in section 42 of the Patent Act, namely the right to make, construct, use and sell the invention.\n[59] The injunction granted by the Federal Court appears in paragraph 4 of its judgment:\nAn injunction is granted until the expiry of the 335 Patent on December 17, 2028, restraining Pharmascience, as well as its subsidiary and affiliated companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, licensees, successors, assigns, and any others over whom it exercises lawful authority, from:\nMaking, constructing, using or selling pms-PALIPERIDONE PALMITATE in Canada in accordance with ANDS Nos. 244641 and 251767;\nOffering for sale, marketing or having pms-PALIPERIDONE PALMITATE marketed in Canada in accordance with ANDS No. 244641 and 251767; and\nImporting, exporting, distributing or having pms-PALIPERIDONE PALMITATE distributed in Canada in accordance with ANDS Nos. 244641 and 251767.\n[60] Pharmascience effectively takes issue with the following activities being included in the injunction: (i) offering for sale, (ii) marketing, (iii) having marketed, (iv) importing, (v) exporting, (vi) distributing, and (vii) having distributed.\n[61] Pharmascience has provided little by way of explanation as to how these activities are supposed to fall outside the scope of a patentee\u2019s exclusive rights. I note that an injunction of similar scope was recently granted by this Court against Apotex Inc. in a parallel action involving Janssen and the 335 Patent (Janssen Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2023 FCA 253). Paragraphs 64 to 70 of that decision explain the reasoning for granting an injunction of that scope.\n[62] I note also, as does Janssen, that Pharmascience did not raise this issue in its notice of appeal.\n[63] I would reject Pharmascience\u2019s alternative argument concerning the scope of the injunction both because it was not raised in the notice of appeal, and for the reasons discussed in paragraphs 64 to 70 of the decision mentioned in paragraph 61 above.\nVI. Conclusion [64] It follows from the foregoing that I would dismiss the present appeal. I would award costs to Janssen in the agreed amount of $10,000, all-inclusive.\n\"George R.

His Majesty the King (Docket No. 2018-917(IT)G) (per Biringer J., as she then was). The decision upheld an assessment issued to Ms. Pillon pursuant to s. 160(1) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.1 (5th Supp.) (the Act). In this appeal, Ms. Pillon submits that the Tax Court made several errors that warrant our intervention.\n[2] By way of background, s. 160(1) is a tax collection measure. It concerns a situation in which a person with an outstanding tax liability transfers property to another person without receiving adequate consideration. If they were not dealing at arm\u2019s length, the person who received the property, the transferee, is liable for the transferor\u2019s outstanding tax liability up to the net amount received.\n[3] In making the assessment issued to Ms. Pillon, the Minister of National Revenue alleged that Ms. Pillon was a transferee who received property from Mr. John Wall, who had outstanding tax liabilities. In 2009 and 2010, Ms. Pillon purportedly received amounts from Mr. Wall totalling $978,900 at a time when he owed over twice that amount under the Act.\n[4] The assessment was appealed to the Tax Court. In that appeal, Ms. Pillon submitted that s. 160(1) did not apply\u2014 first because she gave full consideration for the property received; and second because she dealt at arm\u2019s length with Mr. Wall. Ms. Pillon\u2019s oral evidence in support of these submissions was limited to her own testimony and that of her tax accountant. Mr. Wall did not testify.\n[5] The trial judge was not persuaded by either of these submissions.\n[6] With respect to the consideration paid, Ms. Pillon testified in the Tax Court that she had given full consideration because the transfers were simply repayments of loans that she had made to Mr. Wall. The trial judge rejected this testimony on the grounds that it was not credible. Accordingly, the Court concluded that no loans were made.\n[7] With respect to the non-arm\u2019s length requirement, the issue was whether Ms. Pillon and Mr. Wall were spouses or common-law partners, or whether they were otherwise not dealing at arm\u2019s length. The trial judge determined that they were not spouses or common-law partners, but they otherwise did not deal at arm\u2019s length.\n[8] To determine the non-arm\u2019s length issue, the trial judge applied the legal principles articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada v. McLarty, 2008 SCC 79. She found that Ms. Pillon and Mr. Wall were not dealing at arm\u2019s length because they acted in concert without separate interests. In making this finding, the Court noted that Ms. Pillon or Mr. Wall had signed various documents which indicated that they were: \u201cpartners, common law, husband and wife, reflected a common address, and had also a financial relationship between them.\u201d The trial judge concluded that they had a close personal relationship.\n[9] The Tax Court also considered the evidence concerning Ms. Pillon\u2019s purported loans to Mr. Wall, stating that this might potentially bear on the non-arm\u2019s length issue. The trial judge reached the conclusion that the terms and conditions of the alleged loans did not reflect \u201cordinary commercial dealings between parties acting in their own interests.\u201d\n[10] Based on this and other factors, the Tax Court concluded that s. 160(1) applied.\n[11] In this Court, Ms. Pillon submits that the Tax Court made several errors that concern both issues which warrant our intervention.\n[12] We are of the view that the Tax Court made no such errors. Although the decision was rendered orally, the reasons were detailed and thorough. There was ample support for the conclusions that were reached. In applying the relevant standards of appellate review, we conclude that the correct legal principles were applied by the Tax Court and there was no palpable and overriding error of fact or mixed fact and law.\n[13] Most of Ms. Pillon\u2019s submissions in this Court misinterpret the Tax Court\u2019s decision and are devoid of merit. We would mention two of the submissions in particular.\n[14] At this hearing, Ms. Pillon submitted that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in characterizing the evidence. She submits that she and Mr. Wall acted in their own separate interests and did not act with one single mind.\n[15] We disagree with this submission. The trial judge\u2019s conclusion that there was an absence of separate interests was well supported by the evidence. This was far from a palpable and overriding error.\n[16] The second submission we will mention relates to a finding by the trial judge that there likely would have been a clearer picture of events if Mr. Wall had testified. Ms. Pillon submitted that, because of this finding, it was an error for the Court to decide against her.\n[17] We disagree with this because it fails to take into account that Ms. Pillon had the burden of proof. The Tax Court made this clear and noted that it was Ms. Pillon\u2019s choice to have only herself and her tax accountant testify. Ultimately, the Court concluded that the burden of proof was not satisfied. Therefore, it was not an error to find against Ms. Pillon in circumstances where Mr. Wall did not testify.\n[18] In the result, we are in agreement that the appeal should be dismissed, with costs to the respondent.\n\u201cJudith Woods\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-61-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMARIA PILLON v.

The two are identical, there being no confidential information disclosed in the confidential reasons.\nWEBB J.A.\n[1] Remington Sales Co. d.b.a. Hyundai Heavy Industries (Canada) (Remington) (Appeal EA-2019-009) appealed the re-determination of anti-dumping duties made by the President of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT). Hyundai Canada Inc. (HCI) (Appeals EA-2019-008 and EA-2019-010) also appealed this re-determination to the CITT.\n[2] At the parties\u2019 request, the appeals before the CITT were combined. Although two sets of reasons were issued, the reasons rendered by the CITT in the HCI appeal were adopted in the reasons issued for the Remington appeal.\n[3] The President of the CBSA (President) formed the opinion that the export price under section 24 of the Special Import Measures Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-15 (SIMA) was unreliable based on a reliability test that compared the section 24 export price to the section 25 export price. The CITT found that the President\u2019s opinion should not have been solely based on the reliability test that was used but rather on a number of factors enumerated by the CITT. The CITT decided that the matter was to be remanded to the President for reconsideration.\n[4] Both Remington and HCI filed an appeal to this Court. However, HCI filed a notice of discontinuance of its appeal. Prior to HCI filing its notice of discontinuance, the respondents (the President and Hitachi Energy Canada Inc. (Hitachi)) each filed notices of cross-appeal in relation to Remington\u2019s appeal and HCI\u2019s appeal.\n[5] As a result, Remington\u2019s appeal and the cross-appeals of the President and Hitachi to Remington\u2019s appeal and HCI\u2019s appeal proceeded to hearing in this Court. The appeal and the cross-appeals were consolidated by the Order of this Court dated November 24, 2022, with the appeal A-162-22 being designated as the lead appeal. These reasons will be filed in A-162-22 and a copy thereof will be filed in A-163-22.\n[6] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss Remington\u2019s appeal and allow the cross-appeals of the President and Hitachi. The statutory references herein are to the various sections, subsections and paragraphs of SIMA, unless otherwise noted.\nI. Background [7] Goods imported into Canada are \u201cdumped\u201d (as defined in subsection 2(1)) when the normal value of the goods exceeds the export price of such goods. The margin of dumping is defined in subsection 2(1) as the difference between these two amounts. The normal value is determined in accordance with sections 15 to 23.1 and 30 and the export price is determined in accordance with sections 24 to 28 and 30. If the normal value or export price cannot be determined in accordance with these provisions, such amount is determined in the manner specified by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (section 29).\n[8] In this appeal, the relevant provisions are sections 24 and 25 of SIMA. The full English and French versions of these sections are set out in the Appendix attached to these reasons.\n[9] Under section 24, the export price is the lesser of the exporter\u2019s sale price for the goods (subject to certain adjustments) and the price that the importer has paid or agreed to pay for the goods (subject to certain adjustments).\n[10] Section 25 provides, in part:\n25 (1) Where, in respect of goods sold to an importer in Canada,\n\u2026\n(b) the President is of the opinion that the export price, as determined under section 24, is unreliable\n(i) by reason that the sale of the goods for export to Canada was a sale between associated persons,\n[the export price is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 25].\n[11] The President made a final determination of dumping on October 22, 2012. The determination was made with respect to \u201cliquid dielectric transformers (power transformers) having a top power handling capacity equal to or exceeding 60,000 kilovolt amperes (60 megavolt amperes), whether assembled or unassembled, complete or incomplete, originating in or exported from Korea\u201d (paragraph 5 of the reasons of the CITT in both appeals).\n[12] The CITT made a finding that the dumping had caused injury to the domestic industry on November 20, 2012.\n[13] In 2018, the CBSA initiated a review of the normal values and export prices applicable to power transformers exported from Korea to Canada by Hyundai Electric & Energy Systems (Hyundai Electric). The period of investigation for this review was from November 1, 2016, to October 31, 2018.\n[14] In conducting this review, the CBSA determined that Remington imported transformers produced by Hyundai Electric and that Remington and Hyundai Electric were associated for the purposes of SIMA. The President, based on a reliability test conducted by the CBSA that calculated export prices under section 25, formed the opinion that the export prices determined under section 24 were not reliable. Therefore, the export prices were determined in accordance with the provisions of section 25.\n[15] The export prices determined under section 25 resulted in retroactive assessments of anti-dumping duties.\n[16] Remington and HCI each appealed the re-determination made by the President of the amount of the anti-dumping duties, and in particular the determination of the export price by the President, to the CITT.\nII. Decision of the CITT [17] The hearing before the CITT was an appeal de novo. The CITT addressed the arguments of HCI fully in its reasons issued in HCI\u2019s appeals and then incorporated by reference these reasons in its decision in Remington\u2019s appeal. Therefore, even though HCI has discontinued its appeal to this Court, to understand the reasoning of the CITT it is necessary to refer to the reasons issued by the CITT in HCI\u2019s appeals. The references herein to particular paragraphs in the CITT\u2019s reasons are references to the paragraphs in the reasons issued in the HCI appeals, unless otherwise indicated.\n[18] The issues raised by Remington and HCI all related to the determination of the export price. In particular, they questioned whether a reliability test based on calculating the export price under section 25 was an appropriate basis for the President to form an opinion on whether the export price determined under section 24 was reliable. Remington and HCI also challenged certain deductions that the President made in determining the export price.\n[19] The CITT described the reliability test conducted by the President in paragraph 23:\n\u2026 To perform the reliability test, the CBSA will select a representative sample of transactions and perform the export price calculation using the methodology of section 24 and then using the methodology of section 25 and compare the two results. If the section 25 export price is equal to or greater than the section 24 export price in 80 percent or more of the sample transactions, measured by volume or value as appropriate, then the section 24 export price will normally be considered reliable. Conversely, if the section 25 export price is lower than the section 24 export price in more than 20 percent of the sample transactions, then the section 24 export price will usually be considered unreliable, and section 25 will be used to determine export prices for that exporter.\n[20] The CITT noted, in paragraph 24 of its reasons, that \u201c[t]he aim of the calculations under both sections 24 and 25 is to arrive at an ex-factory price for the goods\u201d.\n[21] The CITT concluded that the President erred in only performing a mathematical computation to assess whether the export price under section 24 was reliable:\n[80] Further, a determination of reliability that is focused exclusively on a mathematical formula comparing section 24 and section 25 export prices, with the objective of determining what should have been the appropriate level of profit realized on the importer\u2019s resale of the goods, falls short of what would constitute an appropriate consideration of relevant factors that determine the reliability of the section 24 export price.\n[22] In paragraph 85, the CITT set out what, in its view, must be considered by the President in forming an opinion on the reliability of the section 24 export price:\nA proper reliability test must examine the section 24 export price in terms of its character or quality. It must assess reliability on the basis of all relevant factors such as the general and specific economic commercial conditions that existed at the time of the transaction, the consistency and accuracy of financial books and records that normally reveal the financial situation of the parties to the transaction, the particular nature of the goods that are the subject of trade, and the commercial context in which the transaction is completed. The reliability test must address the specific mischief which is to be prevented such as manipulation of the prices, etc.\n[23] Since the test used by the President did not assess the \u201ccharacter and quality of the section 24 export price\u201d but rather \u201conly compared two sets of prices \u2014 the section 24 export price and the section 25 export price\u201d (paragraph 86) \u2014 the CITT remanded the matter to the President for reconsideration of whether the section 24 export price was unreliable.\n[24] The CITT then addressed HCI\u2019s arguments concerning the amounts deducted in computing the export price. In particular, HCI submitted that for the purposes of paragraph 25(1)(d), \u201cthe price of the goods as assembled\u201d is the total contract price for the goods and any related services that are to be provided under the contract. The costs, charges or expenses for the services would then be deducted under subparagraphs 25(1)(d)(ii) to (v).\n[25] The CITT found that since SIMA is focused on the dumping of goods, the President did not err in excluding the amounts to be paid for any services that were separately identified in the contract for the sale of the transformers. Since the price for the goods used by the President did not include any amounts payable for such services, no further deduction would be made under subparagraphs 25(1)(d)(ii) to (v) in relation to such services.\n[26] In the reasons related to Remington\u2019s appeal, the CITT summarized its findings with respect to the other deductions that were in issue in relation to the re-determination of the export prices:\n[50] For the same reasons given in EA-2019-008 and EA-2019-010 [HCI\u2019s appeals], the Tribunal also makes several findings regarding the deductions made in re-determining export prices under sections 24 and 25 of SIMA:\n\u2026\n(b) The Tribunal finds that, as the amount of profit is not being challenged, its deduction cannot be an issue, regardless of whether there are amounts regarding profit on services in the profit calculation.\n(c) The Tribunal finds that it is not convinced that the evidence shows that the CBSA engaged in the practice of selecting the higher of service expenses or revenues for the purpose of reducing the section 25 export prices.\n(d) The Tribunal finds that the CBSA correctly deducted third-party expenses for the purpose of arriving at the ex-factory price.\n(e) For reasons of judicial economy, the Tribunal will not address whether paragraph 25(1)(c) should be applied rather than paragraph 25(1)(d). Nothing turns on the outcome of this question in the context of this proceeding.\n[27] The CITT also found that there was no support in SIMA for \u201cRemington\u2019s submission that a specific item that was unforeseen is extraneous and should not have been deducted in the section 25 calculation\u201d (paragraph 51 of the reasons related to Remington\u2019s appeal).\nIII. Issues and Standard of Review [28] Section 62 restricts any appeal to this Court to only questions of law. No appeal lies to this Court on any question of fact or mixed fact and law (unless there is an extricable question of law). Since appeals are restricted to questions of law, the standard of review is correctness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, at para. 37).\n[29] Remington raises three issues in this appeal:\n(a)whether the CITT erred in law in remanding the matter to the President for re-determination;\n(b)whether the CITT erred in law in its interpretation of paragraph 25(1)(d); and\n(c)whether the CITT made incorrect findings of fact in relation to paragraph 25(1)(d) that would constitute errors of law.\n[30] The issues related to the interpretation of paragraph 25(1)(d) and the factual findings in relation to this paragraph will be addressed together.\n[31] In the cross-appeals the issue is whether the CITT erred in determining that the reliability test adopted by the President could not be used to determine the reliability of the section 24 export price.\nIV. Analysis [32] The issues arising in the appeal will be addressed first and then the issue in the cross-appeal will be addressed.\nA. Decision to remand the matter to the President [33] Remington can only succeed with respect to this issue if, as a matter of law, the CITT was required to decide whether the section 24 export price was unreliable and to then determine the export price under section 24 (if the CITT determined that the export price under that section was reliable) or under section 25 (if the CITT determined that the section 24 export price was unreliable).\n[34] Remington, in its argument, emphasized the following statement found at paragraph 89 of the CITT\u2019s reasons:\n[89] However, the Tribunal does not know what the CBSA considered in its decision. Therefore, in these circumstances, the Tribunal must remand this decision back to the CBSA for a reconsideration on the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s reasons.\n[35] Although the reference is to what the CBSA considered in its decision, since the decision in issue is the opinion of the President concerning whether the section 24 export price was reliable, this reference should be read as referring to what the President considered. Remington\u2019s argument is that the CITT did know what the President considered.\n[36] The evidence confirmed that the President relied on the reliability test as described above. The CITT, in its reasons at paragraph 80, found that \u201ca determination of reliability that is focused exclusively on a mathematical formula comparing section 24 and section 25 export prices\u201d was not appropriate. The CITT also noted at paragraph 83 that although the CBSA\u2019s policy indicates that other factors may be relevant in determining the reliability of a section 24 export price, \u201cthere is no evidence that such other factors were taken into account by the President in this case\u201d.\n[37] Remington points to such statements to indicate that the CITT misspoke when it stated that it did \u201cnot know what the CBSA considered in its decision\u201d. However, in my view, this statement must be read in context. The CITT was aware that the President relied on the reliability test described above in forming the opinion of unreliability. The CITT rejected the sole reliance on this mathematical comparison and set out a number of factors that must be considered by the President. Having made these findings, the error made by the CITT in paragraph 89 was simply misstating its rationale for remanding the matter to the President. Having set out a number of factors that the President did not consider, the CITT would not know whether the President (whose opinion is the relevant opinion under section 25) would form the same opinion on reliability once the factors set out in paragraph 85 were considered.\n[38] Subsection 61(3) provides that the CITT may make such order as may be required \u2014 it does not obligate the CITT to make any specific order or finding:\n(3) On any appeal under subsection (1) or (1.1), the Tribunal may make such order or finding as the nature of the matter may require and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may declare what duty is payable or that no duty is payable on the goods with respect to which the appeal was taken, and an order, finding or declaration of the Tribunal is final and conclusive subject to further appeal as provided in section 62.\n(3) Le Tribunal, saisi d\u2019un appel en vertu des paragraphes (1) ou (1.1), peut rendre les ordonnances ou conclusions indiqu\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et, notamment, d\u00e9clarer soit quels droits sont payables, soit qu\u2019aucun droit n\u2019est payable sur les marchandises vis\u00e9es par l\u2019appel. Les ordonnances, conclusions et d\u00e9clarations du Tribunal sont d\u00e9finitives, sauf recours pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 62.\n[39] Whether the circumstances of a particular case would warrant remanding a matter to the President is a question of fact or mixed fact and law and cannot be appealed to this Court. Having found that there were a number of factors that, in the CITT\u2019s view, the President should have considered in rendering the reliability opinion, it was not an error of law for the CITT to remand the matter to the President. Remington cannot succeed on this ground of appeal.\nB. Interpretation of paragraph 25(1)(d) and the factual findings related thereto [40] In paragraph 93 of its reasons, the CITT noted \u201c[t]he basic purpose of SIMA is to address the dumping of goods. It is not intended to address the dumping of services\u201d (emphasis added by the CITT).\n[41] Remington, in its memorandum at paragraph 100, confirms that the ultimate determination is the export price of the goods: \u201c[i]t is obvious that the value of services must be eliminated to determine the export price of the goods.\u201d\n[42] The dispute is how the amount for services is eliminated. In calculating the export price, the CBSA would first determine if the contract specified a separate amount for services. For contracts where the price for the particular goods is set out and an additional amount for services that do not contribute to the value of the goods is also specified, the amount for the goods used by the CBSA, before any deductions contemplated by subparagraphs 25(1)(d)(ii) to (v) were made, was the price identified for the goods; i.e. the amount specified for the services was not included. No amount was deducted under subparagraphs 25(1)(d)(ii) to (v) in relation to these services, as the contract price for these services was not included as part of the price of the goods.\n[43] Remington\u2019s position is that the starting amount should have been the full contract price and then the amounts for the services should have been deducted under subparagraphs 25(1)(d)(ii) to (v).\n[44] Since the parties acknowledged that freight was one such service and that the provision of this service was not confidential, a simple example using freight as the service will illustrate the difference between the two positions.\n[45] Assume that the total contract price is $1,200 and that contract specifies that $1,000 is for particular goods and $200 is for the freight.\n[46] For the purposes of determining the section 25 export price, the CBSA would have used $1,000 as the price for the goods. In this simple example, there would be no further deductions under section 25 and the export price would be $1,000.\n[47] Remington\u2019s position is that the price (before considering the section 25 deductions) should have been $1,200. The freight would then be deducted as required by subparagraphs 25(1)(d)(ii) to (v). If the deduction required for freight would also be $200, then there would no difference in the export price \u2014 it would still be $1,000. However, if the cost of the freight incurred by the exporter was only $150 (which would mean that the exporter marked up the cost of the freight to $200), Remington submitted that the amount to be deducted under subparagraph 25(1)(d)(ii) to (v) would only be $150.\n[48] However, since SIMA is focused on determining whether particular goods are being dumped and the amount of anti-dumping duties to be imposed if goods are dumped, it is far from clear why the export price should reflect an amount for profit realized on a sale of services that do not contribute to the value of the goods. The focus is on the goods, not the services, as acknowledged by the CITT and Remington.\n[49] In this case the CITT made the following findings with respect to the services, the amount payable for which was excluded in determining the starting price for the goods:\n[96] Therefore, the value of services that are a separate and distinct object of trade and do not contribute to the value of the subject good should not be included in the \u201cprice for which the goods were sold\u201d. It would be an error for the CBSA to include the price of services in its calculations where it is not demonstrated that those services were part of the same transaction as that of the transformer and that their value contributes to the value of the subject goods themselves. The prices of those services were set out separately from the prices of the goods and the evidence establishes no connection between the value of the imported transformers themselves and the value of the services that were excluded by the CBSA at the outset of the calculation. In all appearances, those services were distinct and were not part of the consideration when the price of the transformers was set.\n[50] The findings that the prices for the services were set out separately from the prices for the goods and that there was no connection between these services and the value of the goods were findings of fact. Remington argues that these findings of fact are errors of law.\n[51] In Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc., [1997] 1 SCR 748, 1997 CanLII 385 (SCC), the Supreme Court of Canada stated:\n[41] \u2026 If the Tribunal did ignore items of evidence that the law requires it to consider, then the Tribunal erred in law. Similarly, if the Tribunal considered all the mandatory kinds of evidence but still reached the wrong conclusion, then its error was one of mixed law and fact. ...\n[52] In R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45 the Supreme Court noted:\n[25] It has long been recognized that it is an error of law to make a finding of fact for which there is no supporting evidence: Schuldt v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 592, at p. 604.\n[53] In Murphy v Saskatchewan Government Insurance, 2008 SKCA 57, at para. 5, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal also noted that a finding of fact will be an error of law if it \u201c\u2026 (b) is made on the basis of irrelevant evidence or in disregard of relevant evidence; or, (c) is based on an irrational inference of fact\u201d.\n[54] The CITT reviewed the contracts and the services provided and made the factual findings as set out in paragraph 49 above. There was supporting evidence for these findings and there is no indication that the CITT based these findings on irrelevant evidence or by disregarding relevant evidence or on an irrational inference of fact. To the extent that these findings were based on the interpretation of the contracts, as noted by the Supreme Court in Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp., 2014 SCC 53, at para. 50, the interpretation of contracts is a question of mixed fact and law. Remington has not established that the CITT made any errors of fact that would be errors of law.\n[55] Remington also argued that the CITT erred in not finding that the President used the higher of the expense and revenue for a certain service. The CITT reviewed the evidence and found that it was \u201cnot convinced that the evidence shows that the CBSA engaged in the practice of selecting the higher of service expenses or revenues for the purpose of reducing the section 25 export prices\u201d (paragraph 50 (c) of the CITT\u2019s reasons related to Remington\u2019s appeal). This finding of fact does not rise to the level of an error of law.\n[56] With respect to the interpretation of paragraph 25(1)(d), Remington submitted that the CITT erred in referring to \u201cthe price for which the goods were sold\u201d in paragraphs 95 and 96 and footnote 31 of its reasons. Paragraph 25(1)(d) refers to \u201cthe price of the goods as assembled\u201d. Paragraph 25(1)(c) refers to the \u201cthe price for which the goods were so sold\u201d.\n[57] In the appeal before the CITT, there was an issue concerning whether paragraph 25(1)(c) (which applies to goods sold in the condition in which they are imported) or paragraph 25(1)(d) (which applies to goods imported for the purpose of assembly) was applicable to the importations in issue.\n[58] The CITT, in paragraph 105 of its reasons, noted:\n[105] [ABB Power Grids Canada Inc. \u2013 now Hitachi Energy Canada Inc.] submits that paragraph 25(1)(c) should be applied rather than paragraph 25(1)(d), because the goods were sold \u201cin the condition in which they were or are to be imported\u201d (i.e. unassembled) rather than \u201cfor the purpose of assembly\u201d. However, all parties agreed that it would make no difference to the outcome of the calculation.\n[59] Remington, in its memorandum, only acknowledges that the CITT declined to resolve the issue of whether paragraph 25(1)(c) or paragraph 25(1)(d) was applicable. Remington does not otherwise address this paragraph from the CITT reasons, and in particular, does not take issue with the statement that the parties had agreed that the outcome of the calculation would be the same. Since Remington acknowledged at the appeal before the CITT that the same export price would be determined whether paragraph 25(1)(c) or paragraph 25(1)(d) applied, there would be no difference in determining \u201cthe price for which the goods were sold\u201d and the \u201cthe price of the goods as assembled\u201d in this case. Remington is, in effect, acknowledging that for its argument, it is not significant whether the starting point is \u201cthe price for which the goods were sold\u201d or \u201cthe price of the goods as assembled\u201d. If this would have been significant then the outcome of the calculation would not necessarily be the same.\n[60] As a result, even though the correct expression to use when referring to paragraph 25(1)(d) is \u201cthe price of the goods as assembled\u201d, nothing turns on the CITT\u2019s use of the expression \u201cthe price for which the goods were sold\u201d.\n[61] The CITT did not err in interpreting section 25 as allowing the CBSA to use the identified price for the particular goods as the price of the goods excluding any amount specifically identified in the contract as an amount payable for services that did not contribute to the value of the goods. The CITT also did not make any factual findings that would be an error of law.\n[62] In my view, Remington cannot succeed on this ground of appeal.\nC. Conclusion on Remington\u2019s Appeal [63] As a result, I would dismiss Remington\u2019s appeal, with costs.\nD. Cross-Appeal [64] The cross-appeal also challenges the decision of the CITT to remand the matter to the President, albeit for different reasons than submitted by Remington.\n[65] Section 25 provides, in part, that if the President is of the opinion that the export price, as determined under section 24, is unreliable by reason that the exporter and the importer are associated persons for the purposes of SIMA, the export price is to be determined as set out in section 25.\n[66] The CITT rejected the President\u2019s use of the provisions of section 25 to calculate an export price to be compared to the section 24 export price (the amount paid, subject to certain adjustments) to test the reliability of the section 24 price. In essence, the President was using section 25 (which is triggered once the President forms the opinion that the section 24 export price is unreliable) as a basis to form an opinion concerning the reliability of the section 24 export price. This dual role for section 25 (to assist in making the required opinion and to then calculate the export price that will be used, if the opinion is that the section 24 export price is unreliable) was acknowledged by the CBSA at the hearing of this appeal.\n[67] The issue is whether it was an error of law for the CITT to reject this dual role for section 25 and impose mandatory factors that the President must consider in making the required reliability opinion.\n[68] In my view, this was an error of law.\n[69] In paragraph 80 of its reasons, the CITT takes exception to the exclusive use of a mathematical formula comparing section 24 and section 25 export prices. However, SIMA is a numbers based statute. The definition of \u201cdumped\u201d in subsection 2(1) incorporates a comparison of two amounts:\ndumped, in relation to any goods, means that the normal value of the goods exceeds the export price thereof;\nsous-\u00e9valu\u00e9 Qualificatif de marchandises dont la valeur normale est sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 leur prix \u00e0 l\u2019exportation.\n[70] Normal value is defined in subsection 2(1):\n\u201cnormal value\u201d means normal value determined in accordance with sections 15 to 23 and 29 and 30;\nvaleur normale La valeur \u00e9tablie conform\u00e9ment aux articles 15 \u00e0 23, 29 et 30.\n[71] The normal value of goods is to be determined based on the price of like goods that are sold to the persons identified in paragraph 15(a) and in the circumstances as set out in paragraphs 15(b) to (e), subject to certain adjustments. If there are insufficient qualifying sales of like goods, the normal value, subject to section 20, is determined either by using the price at which like goods are sold to other countries or by using the cost of production and adding a reasonable amount for administrative, selling and all other costs and a reasonable amount for profits (section 19).\n[72] The normal value is, therefore, an amount that will require some computation.\n[73] Likewise, export price is an amount that, whether section 24 or 25 is used, will require some computation.\n[74] To determine whether a particular amount is reliable, it would be logical to compare that amount to an amount that is reliable. As noted by the CBSA, Parliament has specified that when the section 24 amount is unreliable, the export price is to be determined under section 25. This would mean that an export price determined under section 25 would be considered reliable. Parliament would not have intended that one unreliable price be replaced by another unreliable price.\n[75] The President chose to use an export price calculated under section 25 as a basis to test the reliability of the section 24 export price. Section 25 stipulates that it is the President\u2019s opinion that is relevant. There are no stipulated guidelines or factors that the President must consider. Therefore, the President has a broad discretion.\n[76] The purpose of SIMA is to determine if goods are being dumped into Canada and if so to impose anti-dumping duties. The duties imposed are determined by a formula (subsection 3(1) and section 30.2). In my view, given the context and purpose of the statutory scheme, the CITT erred in interpreting the provisions of section 25 to find that the President could not use a reliability test based on calculating export prices under section 25. The CITT also erred in imposing non-quantitative factors that the President must consider in assessing the reliability of section 24 export prices in a statutory scheme that is quantitative.\n[77] As a result, I would allow the cross-appeal.\nV. Conclusion [78] I would dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeals. I would set aside the decisions of the CITT and, in rendering the decisions that the CITT should have made, I would dismiss the appeals of Remington and HCI from the re-determination of the amount of the anti-dumping duties. I would award costs to the President and Hitachi in relation to Remington\u2019s appeal and the cross-appeal in relation to that appeal.\n\u201cWyman W. Webb\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nJ.B.

The Board substituted the termination of employment by a one-month suspension without pay. The applicant did not seek judicial review of that decision.\n[2] Two years after the merits decision, the Board rendered a subsequent decision with respect to damages (2022 FPSLREB 95) whereby it ordered aggravated damages for psychological harm suffered by the respondent ($135,000) as well as punitive damages for the denial of the respondent\u2019s right to natural justice ($75,000) and obstruction to the administration of justice ($100,000). This is the decision challenged by the applicant before our Court.\n[3] Essentially, the applicant contends that the aggravated and punitive damage awards are unreasonable as they do not accord with the applicable jurisprudential framework.\n[4] During the hearing before our Court, the debate mostly centered around the Supreme Court\u2019s leading decision on punitive damage awards, Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co., 2002 SCC 18, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 595 (Whiten), and, more particularly, the principle of \u201cproportionality\u201d. The applicant contends that the Board misapplied the Whiten factors and thus failed to consider the \u201cproportionality\u201d of the punitive damages awarded in the present case.\n[5] The applicant\u2019s contention is unpersuasive when considered in light of a careful reading of Whiten. Indeed, although the Board does not explicitly refer to a proportionality analysis in its reasons, this is not fatal to the decision. The Board weighed the relevant factors set forth by the Supreme Court in Whiten and, in particular, considered the other damages award, addressed the need for additional damages (punitive), and it is clear, when the reasons are read as a whole, why, in the Board\u2019s view, the punitive damages award was not disproportionate in the context of the specific circumstances of this case, hence falling within the \u201cbounds of rationality\u201d (Whiten at paras 123, 128). The Board\u2019s 67-page decision, again, when read as a whole, addresses the relevant factors throughout its analysis, as is evidenced at paragraphs 179\u201386, 231\u201335, 240, 243\u201344.\n[6] Overall, the Board\u2019s decision is detailed and it thoroughly addresses the evidence and relevant jurisprudence. The Board\u2019s decision bears the hallmark of reasonableness: it is justified, transparent, and intelligible and falls within the range of acceptable outcomes (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, 441 D.L.R. (4th) 1).\n[7] In reality, the applicant disagrees with the Board\u2019s decision and has sought to challenge it by putting form over substance. In doing so, the applicant invites our Court to reweigh the evidence, make our own findings, and conclude that the quantum of aggravated and punitive damages is disproportionate and unreasonable. This is not our role on reasonableness review. On the particular facts of this case, I see no error that would warrant our intervention.\n[8] For these reasons, I would dismiss the application for judicial review with costs in the all-inclusive amount of $2000.\n\"Richard Boivin\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nRen\u00e9 LeBlanc J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nSylvie E.

PHILIPPE DESROSIERS\nAppellants\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\n(Delivered from the Bench at Ottawa, Ontario, on February 8, 2024).\nBIRINGER J.A.\n[1] The appellants appeal from an interlocutory order of the Tax Court (per Sommerfeldt J.): 2023 TCC 49 [Reasons].\n[2] In the Tax Court, the appellants brought a motion under the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure), SOR\/90-688a to strike assumptions in the Crown\u2019s replies. The Tax Court allowed the motion in part, striking out some of the assumptions, with leave to amend.\n[3] On appeal, the appellants only challenge the following assumption (\u201cFMV Assumption\u201d), which the Tax Court declined to strike:\nThe fair market value of the wines donated by the Appellant and appraised by Nico van Duyvenbode was at most 20% (i.e., a ratio of 1\/5) of the amount stated on the charitable tax receipts[.]\n[4] The Tax Court\u2019s decision not to strike the FMV Assumption was discretionary: Tax Court Rules, subsection 53(1). The appellate standards of review from Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 apply: Canada v. Preston, 2023 FCA 178 at para. 12; Kinglon Investments Inc. v. Canada, 2015 FCA 134 at para. 5.\n[5] As the sole issue in this appeal is whether the Tax Court erred in determining that the FMV Assumption did not meet the threshold for striking out pleadings, a question of mixed fact and law, the standard of review is palpable and overriding error: Kinglon Investments at para. 5; Smith v. Canada, 2022 FCA 91 at para. 16.\n[6] The threshold for striking out pleadings is whether it is \u201cplain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action\u201d: R. v. Imperial Tobacco, 2011 SCC 42 at para. 17; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Canada, 2013 FCA 122 at para. 7; Reasons at para. 19.\n[7] Here, the essence of the appellants\u2019 submission is that the FMV Assumption does not, or cannot, support the Crown\u2019s case. They assert that the Minister arrived at the FMV Assumption by inappropriately relying on statistical data from years (2001\u20132004) that are not at issue. They seek to have the decision of the Tax Court on the FMV Assumption set aside or, in the alternative, to have the FMV Assumption amended to provide data relevant to the taxation years in question.\n[8] The Tax Court judge was alive to the appellants\u2019 submission on the data set: Reasons at paras. 86 and 90. Moreover, the appellants\u2019 argument goes to the merits of the appeal \u2014 whether the FMV Assumption can be proven: House v. Canada, 2011 FCA 234 at para. 30. As the Tax Court judge correctly concluded, the factual dispute about the FMV Assumption will be resolved at trial: Reasons at paras. 37-39 and 91. There, with the benefit of discovery, the parties can each adduce evidence that goes to the soundness of the Minister\u2019s reassessments, including the methodology underlying the FMV Assumption and the data set to which it was applied. The appellants will have an opportunity to \u201cdemolish\u201d the FMV Assumption.\n[9] \u201cWhether the evidence substantiates the pleaded facts, now or at some future date, is irrelevant to the motion to strike\u201d: Imperial Tobacco at para. 23. In assessing the \u201cplain and obvious\u201d standard, it is assumed that pleaded facts can be proven. It is not for a motion judge to \u201cusurp the function of the trial judge\u201d by making determinations of fact or relevance on a preliminary basis: Sentinel Hill Productions (1999) Corp. v. The Queen, 2007 TCC 742 at para. 4; LBL Holdings v. Canada, 2016 FCA 17 at para. 5.\n[10] Here, it cannot be said that the FMV Assumption, if taken to be true, does not provide a reasonable basis for the reassessment: CIBC at para. 7. If the fair market value of the donated wines was \u201cat most 20% \u2026 of the amount stated on the charitable tax receipts,\u201d that goes directly to the grounds for reassessment. Nor is the FMV Assumption \u201cmanifestly incapable of being proven\u201d: Imperial Tobacco at para. 22; Operation Dismantle v. The Queen, 1985 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441 at para. 27. It is not at all \u201cplain and obvious\u201d that the FMV Assumption should be struck.\n[11] The appellants have not established that the Tax Court made a palpable and overriding error in declining to strike the FMV Assumption. The appeal will be dismissed, with costs fixed at $3,000, all-inclusive.\n\u201cMonica Biringer\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-145-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nIRVING EBERT, RICHARD HERMAN and P.

In the Decision, the CRTC directed Bell and Telus Communications Inc. (TCI) to provide reseller competitors access to Bell and TCI\u2019s fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) facilities \u201cover aggregated wholesale HSA\u201d, within Ontario and Quebec, by no later than May 7, 2024. Such access was mandated by the CRTC on a temporary basis, pending the outcome of a broader review that the CRTC is undertaking, following a Notice of Consultation the CRTC issued on March 8, 2023.\n[2] A little background is helpful to put this motion and the Decision into context.\n[3] FTTP facilities enable access to high-speed internet. In ordering the temporary provision of access to Bell and TCI\u2019s FTTP facilities over aggregated wholesale HSA, the Decision requires Bell and TCI (the latter, for only a relatively small number of customers) to allow reseller competitors to temporarily access, on an aggregated basis, Bell and TCI\u2019s fibre network facilities in Ontario and Quebec that deliver to customers wireline access to high-speed internet. The CRTC was of the view that this would open the door to competitors to sell high-speed internet services in Ontario and Quebec that are competitive to those offered by Bell and TCI. In the Decision, the CRTC also mandated the wholesale rates that Bell and TCI can charge resellers on an interim basis for such aggregated access to their FTTP facilities.\n[4] In 2015, the CRTC mandated that facilities based carriers, including Bell and TCI, were required to provide disaggregated FTTP services to resellers and set the wholesale rates that could be charged to resellers for such services.\n[5] The difference between aggregated and disaggregated access is usefully summarized by Bell, at paragraphs 18 and 19 of its Written Representations filed in connection with this motion, as follows:\n18. Facilities Based Carriers invest in two types of facilities, among others: transport facilities and access facilities. Transport facilities allow large amounts of data traffic to be sent and received across a fibre network. They are analogous to highways or transmission power lines. Access facilities, by contrast, connect individual customer locations (i.e., premises) to the fibre network. These access facilities are analogous to local roads or distribution power lines.\n19. The CRTC has historically regulated two types of wholesale Internet services using these facilities:\n(a) Aggregated wholesale Internet service: permits Resellers to lease a combination of both: (i) the access facilities needed to connect to customer locations; and (ii) the transport facilities through which large amounts of traffic can be sent and received. Prior to the Decision, aggregated wholesale service was available for Bell\u2019s fibre-to-the-node Internet service (a good Internet service, but not as fast as FTTP service), but was not available for FTTP service, which is an emerging technology that Facilities Based Carriers use to provide the highest speed Internet services available to them; and\n(b) Disaggregated wholesale Internet service: permits Resellers to lease only the access facilities needed to connect to customer locations, but not the transport facilities. Instead, competitors must obtain transport facilities primarily by either investing in their own networks \u2026 or by leasing facilities from other carriers on a commercial basis. Disaggregated wholesale services have been available on FTTP facilities for some time, but, in practice, none of Bell\u2019s competitors made use of them.\n[6] According to some of the respondents to this motion, the disaggregated access option for FTTP was unfeasible because it was too expensive for them on the terms that the CRTC mandated in 2015.\n[7] On February 9, 2023, the Governor in Council issued an order under section 8 of the Telecommunications Act, S.C. 1993, c 38, entitled the Order Issuing a Direction to the CRTC on a Renewed Approach to Telecommunications Policy, SOR\/2023-23, registered February 10, 2023 (P.C. 2023-110 February 9, 2023) (the Policy Direction).\n[8] Section 10 of the Policy Direction provided as follows:\nAggregated wholesale high-speed access service\nService d\u2019acc\u00e8s haute vitesse de gros group\u00e9\n10 The Commission must mandate the provision of an aggregated wholesale high-speed access service \u2014 that is additional to any other types of wholesale high-speed access services that are mandated \u2014 until it determines that broad, sustainable and meaningful competition will persist even if the provision of an aggregated service is no longer mandated.\n10 Le Conseil doit rendre obligatoire la fourniture de services d\u2019acc\u00e8s haute vitesse de gros group\u00e9 \u2014 qui s\u2019ajoutent \u00e0 tout autre type de service d\u2019acc\u00e8s de gros \u00e0 haut d\u00e9bit dont la fourniture est obligatoire \u2014 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il d\u00e9termine qu\u2019une concurrence vaste, durable et significative perdurera m\u00eame si la fourniture d\u2019un service group\u00e9 n\u2019est plus obligatoire.\n[9] On March 7, 2023, the CRTC issued Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2023-56. In it, the CRTC stated that it was going to review the existing framework for wholesale high-speed access (HSA) \u201c\u2026 in light of changing market conditions, the significant challenges in implementing the framework, and the importance to Canadians of having access to greater choice and more affordable services\u201d. The CRTC also set out its preliminary views that:\n(i) the provision of aggregated wholesale HSA services should be mandated; (ii) access to fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) facilities should be provided over these services; and (iii) the provision of FTTP facilities over aggregated wholesale HSA services should be mandated on a temporary and expedited basis, until the Commission reaches a decision as to whether such access is to be provided indefinitely.\n[10] In its Notice of Consultation, the CRTC invited comments from interested parties. Over 300 companies and individuals intervened before the CRTC to provide their views. Among them were Bell and the respondents who have filed submissions on this motion, namely TekSavvy Solutions Inc. (TekSavvy), Qu\u00e9becor Media Inc., on behalf of Vid\u00e9otron Ltd. (QMI), and Competitive Network Operators of Canada (CNOC).\n[11] In the Decision, the CRTC confirmed, in part, its preliminary views on the temporary relief it was considering to impose. As a result, the CRTC mandated that Bell and TCI were to provide reseller competitors access to Bell and TCI\u2019s FTTP facilities over aggregated wholesale HSA, within Ontario and Quebec, by no later than May, 7, 2024, on a temporary basis pending the outcome of the CRTC\u2019s overall review of the framework for HSA services.\n[12] In reaching this conclusion, the CRTC noted that, in recent years, many additional subscribers have subscribed to Bell\u2019s FTTP service and that the competitive intensity in the sector has declined. The CRTC determined that the temporary aggregated FTTP access that it mandated would help stabilize competition. The CRTC also noted that it was its view that \u201c\u2026 competitors\u2019 inability to practically provide services over FTTP networks has severely affected their ability to effectively compete\u201d. The CRTC continued by stating that it was \u201c\u2026 concerned that this negative impact on wholesale-based competition will become even more severe over time [and that absent] regulatory intervention, meaningful wholesale-based competition will continue to decline\u201d (Decision at para. 57).\n[13] The CRTC limited the scope of the temporary mandated FTTP access to Ontario and Quebec, finding that these were the two areas \u201cwhere wholesale based competition [was] most clearly declining\u201d (Decision at paras. 59 and 68).\n[14] In the Decision, the CRTC addressed Bell\u2019s concerns that it might not be able to recover the implementation costs associated with providing temporary access to its FTTP facilities over aggregated wholesale HSA, if such access were not permanently mandated. The CRTC considered that such issues, should they arise, were \u201c... not insurmountable from a regulatory perspective\u201d. The CRTC continued by stating that it was \u201c... prepared to deal with these matters at a later date should this be required\u201d (Decision at para. 67).\n[15] With this background in mind, I turn to now assess the merits of this motion.\n[16] As noted, Bell seeks to stay the Decision until the disposition of its application for leave to appeal the Decision, and if, leave is granted, until the appeal is decided. If Bell\u2019s motion is granted, Bell would not be required to provide its competitors with temporary access to its FTTP facilities over aggregated wholesale HSA within Ontario and Quebec until this Court rules on Bell\u2019s motion for leave to appeal the Decision, and if, leave is granted, until the appeal is decided.\n[17] TekSavvy, QMI, and CNOC oppose the motion.\n[18] The test for the granting a stay in a case like this is well-known and requires the moving party to establish that: (1) their appeal raises a serious issue; (2) they would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; and (3) the balance of convenience favours granting the stay: RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 1994 CanLII 117 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311 at 334 (RJR-MacDonald); Canada v. Canadian Council for Refugees, 2008 FCA 40, 2008 CarswellNat 150 at para. 18 (Canadian Council for Refugees). All three of the foregoing criteria must be met for a stay to be issued by a court.\n[19] The threshold for establishing the first criterion of a serious issue is generally a low one. It will be met in a case, like the present, if the issues raised in the Notice of Appeal are not frivolous or vexatious: RJR-MacDonald at 348; Canadian Council for Refugees at paras. 18, 22. Here, I am prepared to accept, for purposes of this motion, that Bell\u2019s Notice of Appeal raises at least one such issue.\n[20] However, I find that it has not established that it will suffer irreparable harm if the stay is not granted. Thus, the second criterion for the issuance of the requested stay is not met.\n[21] Irreparable harm refers to the nature, as opposed to the extent, of the harm that a party will suffer if a stay is not granted. There must be \u201ca real probability that unavoidable irreparable harm will result unless a stay is granted\u201d: see Arctic Cat, Inc. v. Bombardier Recreational Products Inc., 2020 FCA 116, 176 C.P.R. (4th) 323 at para. 20, citing Glooscap Heritage Society v. Canada (National Revenue), 2012 FCA 255, [2012] F.C.J. No. 1661 (QL) at para. 31 (Glooscap); see also Dywidag Systems International, Canada, Ltd. v. Garford Pty Ltd., 2010 FCA 232, 406 N.R. 304 at para. 14 (Dywidag); Canada (Attorney General) v. Canada (Information Commissioner), 2001 FCA 25, 268 N.R. 328, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 28584 (13 September 2001) at para. 12 (Canada (Information Commissioner)); Laperri\u00e8re v. D. & A. MacLeod Company Ltd., 2010 FCA 84, 402 N.R. 341 at para. 17 (Laperri\u00e8re); Janssen Inc. v. AbbVie Corporation, 2014 FCA 176, 242 A.C.W.S. (3d) 11 at para. 46.\n[22] Irreparable harm is harm that either cannot be quantified in monetary terms or that cannot be compensated: RJR-MacDonald at 341. Irreparable harm is also harm that is unavoidable: Janssen Inc. v. AbbVie Corporation, 2014 FCA 112, 2014 CarswellNat 1434 at para. 24 (Janssen). As this Court explained at paragraph 24 of Janssen, \u201cit would be strange if a litigant complaining of harm it caused itself, harm it could have avoided or repaired, or harm it can still avoid or repair could get such serious relief [as a stay would afford]\u201d.\n[23] In RJR-MacDonald, the Supreme Court of Canada gave examples of the types of harm that may be irreparable because it cannot be quantified. These include instances where the party seeking the stay will be put out of business or will suffer permanent market loss or irreversible damage to its business reputation: see RJR-MacDonald at 341, citing R.L. Crain Inc. v. Hendry, (1988) 48 D.L.R. (4th) 228 (Sask. Q.B.); American Cyanamid Co. v. Ethicon Ltd., [1975] A.C. 396 (UKHL).\n[24] This Court has held that the probability of such irreparable harm occurring must be established by the party seeking the stay through \u201c\u2026 evidence at a convincing level of particularity \u2026. Assumptions, speculations, hypotheticals and arguable assertions, unsupported by evidence, carry no weight\u201d: Glooscap at para. 31, citing to Dywidag at para. 14; Stoney First Nation v. Shotclose, 2011 FCA 232, 2011 CarswellNat 3639 at para. 48 (Shotclose); Canada (Information Commissioner) at para. 12; Laperri\u00e8re at para. 17; see also, to similar effect, Gateway City Church v. Canada (National Revenue), 2013 FCA 126, 2013 CarswellNat 1314 at paras. 14-16 (Gateway City Church).\n[25] As my colleague Stratas J.A. aptly put it in Gateway City Church, \u201c[g]eneral assertions cannot establish irreparable harm. They essentially prove nothing\u201d (see para. 15). This is because, as Stratas J.A. found in Shotclose at paragraph 48:\nIt is all too easy for those seeking a stay in a case like this to enumerate problems, call them serious, and then, when describing the harm that might result, to use broad, expressive terms that essentially just assert \u2013 not demonstrate to the Court\u2019s satisfaction \u2013 that the harm is irreparable.\n[26] Bell notes that the Court has recognized irreparable harm in the context of orders that it has granted to stay certain CRTC decisions pending an appeal. More specifically, in Aboriginal Voices Radio Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 FCA 172, 2015 CarswellNat 12195, this Court stayed a CRTC decision when the decision mandated the closure of a radio station. Further, in North American Gateway Inc. v. Canadian Radio-Television & Telecommunications Commission, [1997] F.C.J. No. 628, 1997 CarswellNat 1268, this Court stayed a CRTC decision when the evidence established that the effect of the CRTC decision was to put those seeking the stay \u201cout of business within days\u201d at para. 13. Finally, in CKLN Radio Incorporated v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FCA 56, 2011 CarswellNat 316, this Court stayed a CRTC decision that would have resulted in the loss of a sought-after radio frequency in a hotly contested market, with the consequence that a campus radio station was likely to be imperilled.\n[27] As will soon become apparent, the foregoing cases are very different from the present one.\n[28] Bell also points to two unreported speaking orders, issued in 2019 by this Court in 19-A-59. However, due to their brevity, neither order provides any indication of the relevant circumstances that led to its issuance beyond the notation that the Court was satisfied that the stay orders were required to prevent market distortion: see Bell\u2019s Motion Record, Tab 4, Exhibits H and I of the Sonia Atwell Affidavit. On the other hand, in the present case, the CRTC made the Decision with a view to correcting such distortion and preserving competition in the high speed internet market in Ontario and Quebec.\n[29] In the present case, Bell puts forward only general assertions of the harm that it says it will suffer if the stay is not granted, as opposed to evidence at a convincing level of particularity that demonstrates a real probability that unavoidable irreparable harm will result unless a stay is granted.\n[30] Bell says that it will suffer three types of harm that it submits are irreparable if it complies with the Decision, including: (1) it will lose customers and revenue; (2) it will incur unrecoverable implementation costs; and (3) it will have to delay or cancel other projects. However, Bell has failed to substantiate that these harms are irreparable with the necessary degree of convincing particularity.\n[31] In support of its allegations of irreparable harm, Bell relies on an affidavit from its Senior Vice President of Technology Services, Ms. Anuja Sheth (Sheth affidavit), that is speculative and lacks supporting evidence for the harm that Bell alleges it will suffer if a stay is refused. Bell also relies on an affidavit from a law clerk that attaches, among other things, certain filings made in the present case before the CRTC, as well as a decision and other filings made in the case before the Competition Tribunal involving the Rogers-Shaw merger, namely Canada (Commissioner of Competition) v. Rogers Communications Inc. and Shaw Communications Inc., 2023 Comp Trib 1, aff\u2019d 2023 FCA 16, 477 D.L.R. (4th) 553 (Rogers Shaw Merger).\n[32] Most of the harms alleged in the Sheth affidavit are premised on the assumption that the CRTC will not permanently order similar access to Bell\u2019s FTTP facilities over aggregated wholesale HSA at the end of its broad policy review. At this point, this is pure speculation.\n[33] Dealing more specifically with each of the alleged harms, Bell provides no evidence, documentary or otherwise, detailing how or why it is likely to permanently lose customers or revenue. Although the Sheth affidavit refers in passing to estimated and hypothetical losses, the affiant provides little, if any, basis to support the amounts or effects alleged.\n[34] Bell\u2019s estimates also lack necessary nuance. For example, as TekSavvy points out, Bell\u2019s figures fail to distinguish between different types of customers. There is no distinction between customers who may migrate from a wholesale-based competitor using Bell\u2019s dedicated-subscriber line services to a wholesale-based competitor using Bell\u2019s FTTP services; customers who may migrate to a wholesale-based competitor that also uses Bell\u2019s FTTP service; or non-customers who might still subscribe to a wholesale-based competitor that accesses Bell\u2019s FTTP services. In all of these examples, Bell would still gain wholesale revenue in relation to these customers, yet the generalizations in the Sheth affidavit would not account for them.\n[35] In my view, the evidence on alleged market loss tendered by Bell in the Sheth affidavit is comparable to the evidence in Gateway City Church. It is not \u201cevidence at a convincing level of particularity that demonstrates a real probability that unavoidable irreparable harm will result unless a stay is granted\u201d: Gateway City Church at para. 16. It includes several assumptions, speculations, and hypotheticals that are unsupported by evidence and \u201ccarry no weight\u201d: see Glooscap at para. 31.\n[36] Bell also premises its arguments relating to loss of market share and revenue on certain filings made in this case before the CRTC by TekSavvy and CNOC, the Decision, and on the Competition Tribunal\u2019s decision in Rogers Shaw Merger and related filings. Yet, none of the foregoing establishes a real probability that Bell will irreparably lose market share or revenues. While the CRTC intends, via the Decision, to increase competition in the sector, and TekSavvy and CNOC indicated in their submissions to the CRTC that they believed that the temporary access the CRTC contemplated was required, this does not establish a real probability that Bell will permanently lose market share or revenues. As the respondents convincingly point out in their responding materials, the fact that competition might increase does not necessarily translate into a loss of market share for Bell. Further, Bell has offered no details that substantiate how the interim wholesale rates the CRTC has mandated compare to the discounted prices Bell is already offering certain customers.\n[37] As for the Competition Tribunal\u2019s decision in Rogers Shaw Merger and related filings, namely the Responding Witness Statement from Mr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lescadres, I fail to see how they prove much, if anything, of relevance when that case dealt with at least somewhat different services, markets, and issues. While the Competition Tribunal did recognize that Videotron\u2019s acquisition of VMedia, a reseller, was indicative of Videotron\u2019s plans to expand into Ontario, Bell has not offered any evidence linking such an expansion to any permanent loss of its market share or revenues.\n[38] Turning to the alleged unrecoverable implementation costs, the CTRC\u2019s assurance that it can address these concerns, if necessary, is a complete answer to this argument, given that Bell has provided no evidence that shows how or why the CRTC cannot do so. The Sheth affidavit does not convincingly establish that the CRTC could not mandate new rates that would allow Bell to recapture costs expended to institute temporary access in the event the CRTC were to decide not to permanently order similar access to Bell\u2019s FTTP facilities over aggregated wholesale HSA at the end of its broad policy review.\n[39] Finally, Bell\u2019s own choices to redirect or cut its investment dollars do not constitute irreparable harm, but rather a business choice that it appears that it has chosen to make in light of the Decision. In the absence of evidence showing how implementing the temporary mandated access would imperil Bell\u2019s continued existence, I fail to see how making the investments required to implement the Decision instead of others could constitute irreparable harm.\n[40] For all of these reasons, Bell has not demonstrated, to the Court\u2019s satisfaction, \u201cthe actual existence or real probability of harm that can not be repaired later\u201d: Shotclose at para. 48. Its assertions lack the necessary particularity to succeed on part two of the RJR-MacDonald test.\n[41] Given that the RJR-MacDonald test is conjunctive, Bell\u2019s inability to establish that it will suffer irreparable harm means that its motion for stay must be dismissed. It is therefore unnecessary for me to comment on the third factor in the RJR-MacDonald test, being that of the balance of convenience.\n[42] I will accordingly dismiss this motion with a single set of costs, payable by Bell in equal parts to each of the respondents, TekSavvy, QMI, and CNOC.\n\u201cMary J.L.

VIATRIS CANADA and BIOSIMILAR COLLABORATIONS IRELAND LIMITED\nRespondents\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\n(Delivered from the Bench at Ottawa, Ontario, on February 13, 2024).\nBOIVIN J.A.\n[1] The appellants appeal from the judgment of Furlanetto J. of the Federal Court (the judge) rendered on October 3, 2023 (2023 FC 1325), which dismissed the appellants\u2019 application for judicial review of a decision of the Minister of Health (the Minister). The Minister\u2019s decision held that the respondent, Biosimilar Collaborations Ireland Limited, should obtain the benefits of section 5 of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations, SOR\/93-133 (Regulations), in particular, prior service of the Notice of Allegation. The judge found that the Minister\u2019s decision should be reviewed under the reasonableness standard and concluded that the decision was reasonable.\n[2] When seized of an appeal from an application for judicial review disposed of by the Federal Court, this Court must step into the shoes of the Federal Court and concentrate on the administrative decision in question (Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559 at para. 46).\n[3] We are all of the view that this appeal cannot succeed.\n[4] Firstly, with respect to the standard of review, the judge did not err in refusing to apply the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. Entertainment Software Association, 2022 SCC 30, 471 D.L.R. (4th) 391, exception to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. As observed by the judge, our Court in Teva Canada Limited v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2016 FCA 248, [2017] 3 F.C.R. 80 at paras 56\u201357 found that this Court\u2019s role as first instance decision-maker arises only when a proceeding is initiated under section 6 of the Regulations (see also AbbVie Corporation v. Canada (Health), 2022 FC 1209). Hence, contrary to the appellants\u2019 contention, there is no concurrent jurisdiction between the Federal Court and the Minister in terms of the administration of section 5 of the Regulations: it squarely falls within the purview of the Minister. As such, the standard of review in this case is reasonableness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653 (Vavilov)).\n[5] Secondly, the appellants have submitted a number of arguments alleging that the Minister\u2019s decision is both incorrect and unreasonable. However, we see no errors in the Minister\u2019s reasoning that would warrant our intervention. The Minister\u2019s interpretation is consistent with the purpose and scheme of the Regulations (Janssen Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2023 FCA 253; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 26, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 533) and his decision is both justifiable and justified and bears the hallmarks of reasonableness as required by Vavilov.\n[6] As stated above, the judge correctly identified the standard of review and properly applied it. Specifically, the judge\u2019s reasons are thorough and we can do no better than to adopt them as our own. Our intervention is not required.\n[7] The appeal will be dismissed with costs to the respondents.\n\"Richard Boivin\"\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-283-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nBAYER INC. and, REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. v.

Introduction [1] In 1996, Falconbridge Limited (Falconbridge) offered to acquire publicly-traded shares of Diamond Fields Resources Inc. (Diamond Fields) for consideration valued at approximately $4.1 billion. A bidding auction took place and Falconbridge lost to its competitor, Inco Ltd. (Inco). In connection with its offer, Falconbridge received fees (Fees) from Diamond Fields totalling $101,541,987.\n[2] The appellant, Glencore Canada Corporation (Glencore), is a successor to Falconbridge. Pursuant to the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (Act), Glencore received a reassessment for Falconbridge\u2019s 1996 taxation year in which the Fees, less related expenses, were included in income. The Tax Court of Canada (per Favreau J.) upheld the reassessment for reasons (TC Reasons) cited as 2021 TCC 63. Glencore appeals from this judgment to this Court.\n[3] As explained below, I would dismiss the appeal but for different reasons than the Tax Court. The Tax Court determined that the Fees constituted income from a business in accordance with s. 9(1) of the Act. I also conclude that the Fees were income from a business, and income from property, but pursuant to s. 12(1)(x) of the Act.\nB. Background The auction [4] The target of the bidding auction (Diamond Fields) and the bidders (Falconbridge and Inco) were all Canadian mining companies. The auction unfolded over a 2-month period early in 1996.\n[5] At the relevant time, Falconbridge was an established public corporation whose operations were described by the Tax Court as exploring, developing, mining, processing, marketing and selling metals and minerals (TC Reasons at para. 4). The business was conducted by Falconbridge directly and through subsidiary corporations (TC Reasons at para. 9).\n[6] Diamond Fields was also a public corporation. Its primary asset was a nickel-copper-cobalt deposit (Deposit) at Voisey\u2019s Bay, Labrador which it acquired in February 1995. At all material times, the Deposit was owned by a Diamond Fields\u2019 subsidiary, Voisey\u2019s Bay Nickel Company (Voisey\u2019s Bay Co.).\n[7] Inco was also a public corporation and was a major competitor of Falconbridge.\n[8] The sequence of events below is based mainly on the parties\u2019 agreed statement of facts:\n(i) On June 8, 1995, Diamond Fields and Inco entered into an agreement regarding the Deposit. Under its terms:\n(a)Inco acquired 25 percent of the shares of Voisey\u2019s Bay Co.;\n(b)Inco agreed to market all nickel and cobalt production from the Deposit for the first 5 years of production and agreed to market a minimum amount of nickel production for the following 15 years; and\n(c)In the event that Diamond Fields received a takeover offer from a third party, it agreed to notify Inco of the offer and provide Inco with a reasonable opportunity to discuss it.\n(ii) Also on June 8, 1995, Inco announced that it had acquired 2 million of the outstanding Diamond Fields common shares.\n(iii) Early in 1995, Falconbridge held discussions with Diamond Fields to acquire an interest in the Deposit. These discussions failed.\n(iv) Early in 1996, Diamond Fields contacted Falconbridge about a possible sale of its 75 percent interest in Voisey\u2019s Bay Co.\n(v) On February 9, 1996, Falconbridge and Diamond Fields agreed to arrangements to merge under which Falconbridge would offer to acquire the outstanding common shares of Diamond Fields by way of a plan of arrangement. The consideration to be received by the Diamond Fields shareholders was to be a combination of Falconbridge shares, cash and exchangeable notes for a total value of approximately $4.1 billion. These arrangements acknowledged that Diamond Fields would discuss the Falconbridge offer with Inco pursuant to the agreement mentioned above.\n(vi) On March 26, 1996, Inco also made an offer to acquire Diamond Fields\u2019 outstanding common shares. The consideration was to consist of Inco shares, cash and exchangeable notes with a total value of approximately $4.3 billion.\n(vii) On April 2, 1996, Falconbridge made a counter-offer.\n(viii) On April 3, 1996, the Diamond Fields board of directors recommended that its shareholders reject the Falconbridge counter-offer and accept Inco\u2019s offer.\n(ix) On April 9, 1996, Falconbridge dropped out of the bidding.\n(x) Diamond Fields\u2019 shareholders eventually accepted Inco\u2019s offer and the merger was completed in August 1996.\nThe Falconbridge merger arrangements [9] The merger arrangements between Falconbridge and Diamond Fields contemplated the Fees that are at issue in this appeal. There were two fees, which were called a Commitment Fee and a Non-Completion Fee.\n[10] A Commitment Fee in the amount of $28,206,106 was payable by Diamond Fields to Falconbridge upon entering into the merger arrangements. This occurred on February 9, 1996.\n[11] A Non-Completion Fee in the amount of $73,335,881 was payable by Diamond Fields to Falconbridge upon certain conditions being satisfied. One of these was that a competing offer was completed. This fee is described in greater detail below.\n[12] The Fees were both paid in 1996.\n[13] The merger arrangements included an Arrangement Agreement. It set out the terms and conditions on which the merger would be carried out.\n[14] The Arrangement Agreement provided that Falconbridge and Diamond Fields were each required to use reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary approvals to complete the merger. This included approvals from the corporations\u2019 respective shareholders. In addition, Diamond Fields agreed that it would not facilitate discussions with others concerning a competing bid. This obligation only took effect after Diamond Fields had an opportunity to discuss Falconbridge\u2019s offer with Inco.\n[15] The Arrangement Agreement also specified that the terms and conditions were subject to the fiduciary duties of Diamond Fields\u2019 board of directors. This meant that throughout the bidding process another bidder (including Inco) could make an offer that the board of directors might decide to support instead. This is in fact what occurred.\nC. Tax Court decision [16] The Tax Court stated that the appeal raised two issues: (1) whether the Fees were properly included in Glencore\u2019s income; and (2) in the alternative, whether the Fees gave rise to a capital gain.\n[17] With respect to the first issue, the Tax Court divided this into two sub-issues: (1) whether the Fees were income from a source pursuant to s. 3 of the Act; and (2) whether the Fees were taxable under s. 12(1)(x) of the Act.\n[18] The Tax Court concluded that the first sub-issue was dispositive of the appeal. It determined that the Fees were income from a source since they were income from a business pursuant to s. 9(1) of the Act. The Tax Court declined to discuss the other issues.\n[19] The Tax Court\u2019s analysis of s. 9(1) of the Act is discussed below.\nD. Issues and Standard of Review [20] This appeal gives rise to three issues:\n(i) Did the Tax Court err in concluding that the Fees were business income pursuant to s. 9(1) of the Act?\n(ii) Did the Non-Completion Fee give rise to a capital gain?\n(iii) Should the Fees be included in computing income from a business or property pursuant to s. 12(1)(x) of the Act?\n[21] The Tax Court judgment is subject to appellate standards of review as set out in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. Determinations of fact and mixed fact and law are entitled to deference and attract the palpable and overriding error standard of review. Determinations of law (including extricable legal questions) are subject to correctness review.\n[22] Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada commented on the application of these standards of review in circumstances where the overall conclusion is based on an extricable error of law (Deans Knight Income Corp. v. Canada, 2023 SCC 16 at para. 121). The reasons of the majority state that no deference is owed to the overall conclusion, but that deference continues to apply to factual findings. However, it cautions that \u201cfacts which were decisive when answering the wrong legal question are not necessarily as salient when answering the right one.\u201d\nE. Issue 1 \u2013 Did the Tax Court err in concluding that the Fees were business income pursuant to s. 9(1)? [23] The Tax Court applied the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Ikea Ltd. v. Canada, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 196, 155 D.L.R. (4th) 295 [Ikea]. As I explain below, the principles from Ikea were misinterpreted by the Tax Court and this resulted in an extricable error of law.\n[24] Ikea, the well-known furniture retailer, received a tenant inducement payment (TIP) from the West Edmonton Mall in connection with entering into a long-term lease. The issue was whether the TIP was received on income or capital account. The Supreme Court noted that s. 12(1)(x) of the Act could not apply because the provision was not in force at the relevant time (Ikea at para. 20).\n[25] In the Supreme Court, Iacobucci J. concluded that the TIP was received on income account based on the factual finding that the TIP was made to reimburse rent or other obligations on revenue account. The Court stated that since \u201cthe TIP was made to reimburse an expense on income account [it] was clearly itself income\u201d (Ikea at para. 29).\n[26] The conclusion was summarized at paragraph 33 of Ikea. This is reproduced below, with emphasis on the passage that was relied on by the Tax Court.\n[33] In my view, Bowman J. was entirely correct in finding that the TIP received by Ikea was on revenue account and should have been included in income for tax purposes. The payment was clearly received as part of ordinary business operations and was, in fact, inextricably linked to such operations. On the evidence, no question of linkage to a capital purpose can seriously be entertained. Had Ikea wished, it could have requested that the TIP be advanced expressly for the specific purpose of fixturing, or to defray some other capital cost. It did not do so, however, and the payment was in fact made free of any conditions for or stipulations as to its use. Therefore, whether the TIP represented a reduction in rent or a payment in consideration of Ikea\u2019s assumption of its various obligations under the lease, it clearly cannot be treated as a capital receipt and should have been included in Ikea\u2019s income. . . .\n[Emphasis added]\n[27] The passage that was relied on by the Tax Court is broadly worded. It needs to be read in context. The Tax Court failed to do this, as demonstrated in the following excerpt from its reasons, and in particular the underlined passage:\n[74] The potential acquisition of DFR was a means to acquiring the Voisey\u2019s Bay deposit and the evidence clearly establishes that the Falconbridge\u2019s business included the acquisition of mineral deposits.\n[75] The Break Fees received by Falconbridge were inextricably linked to Falconbridge\u2019s ordinary business operations as a nickel mining company. Falconbridge pursued the Voisey\u2019s Bay deposit for the purpose of making a profit. As a public company, all of Falconbridge\u2019s activities were directed to that end i.e. to increase shareholder value. The potential acquisition of the Voisey\u2019s Bay deposit was part of Falconbridge\u2019s strategy for earning income from its business.\n[76] Falconbridge was carrying on its business when it negotiated the Merger Offer Delivery Agreement and the Arrangement Agreement, both of which provided for the fees in dispute. Falconbridge\u2019s strategy in attempting to acquire the Voisey\u2019s Bay deposit was to maximize shareholder value by maintaining and bolstering its ore reserves and by containing its production costs. These goals were inextricable [sic] interwoven with Falconbridge\u2019s business. The Break Fees were ancillary business income received by Falconbridge in the course of earning income from business.\n[Emphasis added]\n[28] The Court\u2019s interpretation of Ikea, and its application to the facts, essentially ignores the distinction between capital and revenue receipts. This was the very issue in Ikea.\n[29] When Ikea is read as a whole, it is evident that Iacobucci J.\u2019s reference to ordinary business operations in paragraph 33 is referring to something on revenue account. The very next sentence in Ikea states that there is no link to a capital purpose.\n[30] The necessary linkage to something on revenue account is also made clear at paragraph 30 of Ikea:\n[30] As for the second contention, Ikea argued that if the payment were to be characterized as consideration for its continued obligation to carry on business in the premises during the term of the lease, it should be considered a capital receipt because such a payment goes to the \u201cstructure of the business\u201d. With respect, however, I believe this submission misses the mark. An accurate characterization of the receipt requires an assessment of the nature of the specific obligations in question. In this case, as Bowman J. correctly found, Ikea\u2019s obligations under the lease essentially consisted of the payment of rent and the operation of its business in the leased premises. These were clearly expenses incurred in the day\u2011to\u2011day operation of the business and were therefore on revenue account.\n[31] The Tax Court\u2019s misinterpretation of Ikea is an extricable error of law. It should have considered whether the Fees were linked to something on revenue account. Accordingly, the outcome in the Tax Court is not entitled to deference.\n[32] As explained below, in my view the Fees have no linkage to revenue.\n[33] The Tax Court made factual findings that the Fees were linked to \u201cpursuing the Voisey\u2019s Bay deposit for the purpose of making a profit. As a public company, all of Falconbridge\u2019s activities were directed to that end\u201d (TC Reasons at para. 75). However, the Fees were actually linked to pursuing shares, not the Deposit itself. Either way, the linkage is to a capital purpose. The fact that the goal was to make a profit does not transform the linkage to a revenue item. The clear linkage was to capital.\n[34] In this Court, the Crown submitted that the application of Ikea in this case is supported by the decision of this Court in Morguard Corporation v. Canada, 2012 FCA 306 [Morguard]. In Morguard, this Court upheld a decision of the Tax Court which applied Ikea to a break fee received as part of a failed takeover bid.\n[35] However, the facts in Morguard are materially different from the facts in this case. For example, in Morguard the Tax Court determined that Morguard Corporation was in the business of acquiring companies. In this case, the Tax Court found that Falconbridge was not in the business of acquiring or selling companies (TC Reasons at para. 73). It is not surprising that the Tax Court did not rely on Morguard.\n[36] The Crown urged us to apply Morguard despite this difference. Essentially, it seeks to extend Morguard beyond its particular facts. In my view, an extension to the facts of this case is not warranted because it would erode the well-entrenched principles as to the distinction between items on capital and revenue account. I am not aware of any facts in this case which would provide a sufficient link between the Fees and something on revenue account. I conclude that the Fees were received on capital account because the linkage was to a proposed acquisition of a capital asset.\nF. Issue 2 \u2013 Did the Non-Completion Fee give rise to a capital gain? [37] Glencore submits that the $73 million Non-Completion Fee is compensation to Falconbridge for disposing of its right to merge with Diamond Fields. As such, the receipt of the Non-Completion Fee gave rise to a capital gain. This argument was not discussed by the Tax Court.\n[38] For clarity, this submission does not apply to the Commitment Fee.\n[39] A capital gain is generally a gain from the disposition of property, unless the gain is otherwise included in computing income. The capital gain is calculated as the compensation received for the disposition, less the cost of the property disposed of and expenses incurred in the disposition.\n[40] Whether the Non-Completion Fee gave rise to a capital gain depends in large part on the bid terms set out in the Arrangement Agreement. It required that Falconbridge and Diamond Fields each facilitate the completion of the merger. This required approvals from the shareholders of both companies. The Arrangement Agreement also provided that nothing in that agreement restricted Diamond Fields\u2019 board of directors from supporting or facilitating a competing bid in fulfilment of its fiduciary duties.\n[41] The Arrangement Agreement also set out the different circumstances in which the Non-Completion Fee would be payable. In all cases, the Non-Completion Fee was not payable unless a competing offer was made and completed. The circumstances which triggered Diamond Fields\u2019 obligation to pay the Non-Completion Fee were: (1) a competing offer was made before August 31, 1996; (2) the Arrangement Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms when Falconbridge dropped out of the bidding; and (3) the transaction contemplated by the competing offer was completed.\n[42] To qualify as a capital gain, the Non-Completion Fee must be received as compensation for the disposition of property. Glencore submits that the Non-Completion Fee was received as compensation for the disposition of Falconbridge\u2019s right to merge.\n[43] I reject this submission. Neither the Arrangement Agreement nor any other agreement provided Falconbridge with a right to merge. Diamond Fields did not promise that the merger with Falconbridge would be completed. It could not make that promise for two reasons. First, Falconbridge\u2019s offer was directed to Diamond Fields shareholders. Diamond Fields could not promise their acceptance of the offer. Second, Diamond Fields\u2019 board of directors was not obligated to support Falconbridge\u2019s bid if there was a competing bid that, by virtue of their fiduciary duties, the directors were required to support.\n[44] I conclude that the Non-Completion Fee was not paid as compensation for the disposition of the right to merge. The receipt of this fee did not give rise to a capital gain.\nG. Issue 3 \u2013 Should the Fees be included in computing income pursuant to s. 12(1)(x)? [45] The main position of the Crown in this appeal is that the Fees are income from a business pursuant to Ikea. In the alternative, the Crown submits that the Fees are income pursuant to s. 12(1)(x) of the Act either as an inducement or a reimbursement. This alternative argument was not discussed by the Tax Court.\n[46] Paragraph 12(1)(x) was enacted pursuant to a proposal in the federal budget of May 22, 1985. The proposal is described in the budgetary supplementary information:\nIt is a generally accepted commercial principle that the cost of an asset or the amount of an expense should be reduced by any reimbursement or similar payment received that relates to the acquisition of the asset or the incurring of the expense. For example, a commercial tenant who was reimbursed by a landlord for part or all of the cost of making leasehold improvements would subtract the payment in computing the cost of such property. A similar result would arise with respect to manufacturers\u2019 rebates.\nRecent court decisions have indicated that this principle may not apply for income tax purposes.\nThe budget proposes to require that all payments in the nature of reimbursements or inducements in respect of the acquisition of an asset or the incurring of a deductible expense be included in income for tax purposes unless the recipient elects to reduce the cost basis of the related property or the amount of related expense. This would apply to payments received after May 22, 1985 other than payments received under an agreement in writing made on or before that date. The law already specifically requires similar treatment for certain payments received as government assistance for the acquisition of property.\n[47] The current version of s. 12(1)(x) is reproduced below in relevant part. There are no material changes from the version applicable to this appeal.\n12(1) There shall be included in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year as income from a business or property such of the following amounts as are applicable\n12(1) Sont \u00e0 inclure dans le calcul du revenu tir\u00e9 par un contribuable d\u2019une entreprise ou d\u2019un bien, au cours d\u2019une

issues:\n(i) Do the exclusions in s. 12(1)(x)(v) or (vii) apply to the Fees?\n(ii) Is the payer requirement in s. 12(1)(x)(i) or (ii) satisfied?\n(iii) Is it reasonable to consider that the Fees were received as an inducement or reimbursement for the purposes of s. 12(1)(x)(iii) or (iv)?\n(iv) Were the Fees received in the course of earning income from a business or property?\nSubparagraphs 12(1)(x)(v) and (vii) - Exclusions [49] Paragraph 12(1)(x) contains several exclusions. The potentially relevant ones in this case are ss. 12(1)(x)(v) and (vii).\n[50] Subparagraph 12(1)(x)(v) excludes, among other things, an amount that would otherwise be included in computing income. The parties provided no submissions which would give the Court a basis to apply this exclusion.\n[51] As for s. 12(1)(x)(vii), this provision (in combination with related provisions), permits a taxpayer to reduce a s. 12(1)(x) income inclusion to the extent that the receipt relates to an outlay or expense that is not deducted in computing income. The parties agree that this provision applies in respect of Falconbridge\u2019s expenses related to the bid. Accordingly, the amount of the Fees that are potentially subject to s. 12(1)(x) is reduced by the amount of the bid expenses.\nSubparagraph 12(1)(x)(i) or (ii) \u2013 The payer requirement [52] Paragraph 12(1)(x) requires that the payer satisfy one of the criteria set out in s. 12(1)(x)(i) and (ii). This is not at issue because Glencore concedes that the requirement is satisfied.\nSubparagraph 12(1)(x)(iii) or (iv) \u2013 Type of receipts [53] Subparagraphs 12(1)(x)(iii) and (iv) set out the type of receipts that s. 12(1)(x) applies to. They include amounts that \u201ccan reasonably be considered to have been received\u201d (1) as a reimbursement in respect of the cost of property or an outlay or expense, or (2) as an inducement. As explained below, I conclude that the Fees were received as an inducement.\n[54] The inducement provision in s. 12(1)(x)(iii) is broad. First, the dictionary definition of the word \u201cinducement\u201d suggests that it applies in a variety of circumstances. In the Oxford English Dictionary (Online: https:\/\/www.oed.com), the meaning includes \u201cthat which induces; something attractive by which a person is led on or persuaded to action.\u201d\n[55] Second, the text of s. 12(1)(x)(iii) suggests that the term \u201cinducement\u201d is intended to be all encompassing. Indeed, the provision in both English and French versions specifies certain types of receipts and then adds \u201cany other form of inducement\u201d in English and \u201cou sous toute autre forme\u201d in French.\n[56] I also note that s. 12(1)(x)(iii) applies to inducements generally. This contrasts with the reimbursement provision in s. 12(1)(x)(iv) which requires that the receipt is in respect of the cost of property or an outlay or expense. The difference in wording appears to be a change from the supplementary budget information reproduced above.\n[57] In this case, the Fees satisfy the inducement requirement in s. 12(1)(x)(iii). It is reasonable to consider that the Commitment Fee and the Non-Completion Fee were received by Falconbridge as an inducement to entice Falconbridge to commit to make an offer for the shares of Diamond Fields in accordance with the merger arrangements.\n[58] The nature of the Commitment Fee is clear from its name, and also from the fact that it is payable simply by Falconbridge committing to make the offer. Accordingly, the Commitment Fee induces Falconbridge to make the commitment.\n[59] The Non-Completion Fee is a type of fee commonly referred to as a break fee. The general nature of a break fee was recently discussed by the Alberta Securities Commission in Re Bison Acquisition Corp., 2021 ABASC 188 at paras. 231-232, which refers to CW Shareholdings Inc. v. WIC Western International Communications Ltd. (1998), 39 O.R. (3d) 755 (Ontario Court (General Division)):\n[231] Break fees are intended to entice bidders to participate in an auction. As alluded to in the previous section of this decision, they compensate a party for its wasted time, resources, and lost opportunity costs should a proposed transaction fail (CW Shareholdings (Ont. Gen. Div.) at para. 50). They can offset various potential risks, including disclosure risk and reputational risk. From the target\u2019s perspective, agreeing to a break fee may assist it in its goal of generating the best bid to maximize shareholder value. From the bidder\u2019s perspective, a break fee protects against \u201cthe price being shopped and the transaction being abandoned in favour of a marginally better deal\u201d (Pacifica at para. 49).\n[232] CW Shareholdings (Ont. Gen. Div.) is a leading case on the subject of break fees in Canada. In its reasons, the Ontario Court accepted that a break fee is appropriate where (at para. 51):\n(i) it is needed to induce a competing bid;\n(ii) the bid represents better value for shareholders; and\n(iii) the fee reflects \u201ca reasonable commercial balance between its potential negative effect as an auction inhibitor and its potential positive effect as an auction stimulator\u201d (the CW Shareholdings Test).\n[Emphasis added]\n[60] The first sentence in the passage above clearly describes the nature of the Non-Completion Fee in this case. It was an inducement. This is amply supported by the record:\n(i)The Management Information Circular dated March 8, 1996 provided by Diamond Fields to shareholders states that \u201cDiamond Fields believes that Falconbridge would not have entered into the Arrangement Agreement without Diamond Fields\u2019 agreement to pay [the Fees].\u201d\n(ii)At a Falconbridge board meeting held the day before Falconbridge committed to make the offer, Don Lindsay, the lead negotiator on behalf of Falconbridge, reported that Inco would not table an offer unless Diamond Fields first obtained an offer from Falconbridge.\n(iii)Jack Cockwell, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Falconbridge, was asked on cross-examination whether Mr. Friedland, the CEO of Diamond Fields, was trying to get an auction going. Mr. Cockwell\u2019s answer was \u201cNo question.\u201d\n(iv) Don Lindsay testified that \u201cwe were firm that it had to be at least a $100 million break fee.\u201d\n[61] I conclude that Diamond Fields paid the Fees in order to entice Falconbridge to make an offer pursuant to the merger arrangements. Accordingly, it is reasonable to consider that the Fees were received by Falconbridge as an inducement for the purposes of s. 12(1)(x).\n[62] It does not make any difference that the payment of the Non-Completion Fee was conditional on the bid failing. Subparagraph 12(1)(x)(iii) focusses on the reason for the payment. Diamond Fields agreed to make the payment in order to entice Falconbridge to make the offer.\n[63] In addition, the evidence as to Falconbridge\u2019s motivation to negotiate a fee (i.e., to deter another bidder and to earn a profit if the bid failed) is not relevant to this issue. Subparagraph 12(1)(x)(iii) asks the question whether Diamond Fields made the payment as an inducement. Whether Falconbridge had different motivations is not relevant.\n[64] Finally, an inducement for the purpose of s. 12(1)(x) can include a payment made to entice a party to enter into a commercial arrangement. The wording is certainly broad enough, and the Tax Court decision of Bowman J. in Everett\u2019s Truck Stop Ltd. v. Canada, 93 D.T.C. 965 is an example of this application.\n[65] I conclude that it is reasonable to consider that the Fees were received as an inducement for the purposes of s. 12(1)(x)(iii).\nGeneral requirement \u2013 Received in the course of earning income from a business or property [66] The opening language of paragraph 12(1)(x) provides that it only applies to an amount that is: \u201creceived in the course of earning income from a business or property.\u201d\n[67] Since s. 12(1)(x) does not apply to amounts that would otherwise be included in computing income, this requirement only applies to amounts that are not business or property income in accordance with s. 9(1) of the Act. Accordingly, this test is broader than the test for ordinary business and property income under s. 9(1).\n[68] The meaning of the phrase \u201cin the course of\u201d is central to understanding this requirement. It is a phrase that is commonly used in the Act and has generally been given the meaning ascribed to it by Thurlow J. in M.N.R. v. Yonge Eglinton Building Ltd., [1974] 1 F.C. 637; 74 D.T.C. 6180 (FC-AD): \u201cin connection with\u201d; \u201cincidental to\u201d; or \u201carising from\u201d. The French version, \u201cpendant qu\u2019il tirait un revenue d\u2019une enterprise ou d\u2019un bien,\u201d is similarly broad and supports, reinforces and strengthens this interpretation. The question is whether this describes the relationship between the Fees and Falconbridge\u2019s business or property income-earning activity.\n[69] Falconbridge is an integrated nickel mining company that is involved in exploring, developing, mining, processing, marketing and selling metals and minerals. Its operations are carried out directly and through subsidiaries. (TC Reasons at paras. 4, 9).\n[70] The Fees were linked to Falconbridge\u2019s operations as a nickel mining company. These operations required access to ore deposits. (TC Reasons at paras. 74-75). Accordingly, the Fees were received \u201cin connection with\u201d, or \u201cin the course of\u201d, these activities. It is sufficient for the purpose of this test that Falconbridge carries on these operations directly. It is not relevant that Falconbridge also has mining subsidiaries.\n[71] In addition, the Fees were linked to an acquisition of shares that had the capacity to produce property income. Accordingly, the Fees were also received in the course of earning income from property.\n[72] I conclude that the Fees were received by Falconbridge in the course of earning income from a business and property.\nParagraph 12(1)(x) applies\n[73] I conclude that the necessary conditions for the application of s. 12(1)(x) are satisfied in this case. The Fees, less the bid-related expenses, are required to be included in computing income from a business or property.\nH. Disposition [74] The judgment of the Tax Court dismissed Glencore\u2019s appeal from a reassessment for the 1996 taxation year. The conclusion that I have reached does not disturb this result.\n[75] Therefore, I would dismiss this appeal with costs fixed in the amount of $3,000 in accordance with the agreement of the parties.\n\u201cJudith Woods\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nRichard Boivin J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nJ.B.

ENTERTAINMENT INC.\nRespondents\nREASONS FOR ORDER\nLOCKE J.A.\n[1] The individual appellants, Marshall and Antonio Macciacchera, seek leave under Rule 120 of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106, to represent the corporate appellants in this appeal of which they are officers.\n[2] Though the notice of motion indicates that it is a motion in writing, Messrs. Macciacchera have requested in a separate letter that a hearing be scheduled to hear oral submissions. Per Rule 369.2, motions before this Court are generally decided on the basis of written submissions. A request that a motion be heard orally should include reasons. Messrs. Macciacchera\u2019s request for an oral hearing does not include reasons. Further, I see no need for an oral hearing. Accordingly, I will decide this motion on the basis of the written submissions.\n[3] Rule 120 provides that \u201c[a] corporation \u2026 shall be represented by a solicitor in all proceedings, unless the Court in special circumstances grants leave to it to be represented by an officer\u2026\u201d. Messrs. Macciacchera recognize that they bear the onus of showing \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d. They also recognize that this onus generally requires that they demonstrate that (i) they cannot afford a lawyer, (ii) they will not be required to be both advocate and witness; (iii) the issues are not so complex as to be beyond their capabilities; and (iv) the appeal can proceed in an expeditious manner: Glycobiosciences Inc. v. L\u2019Oreal Canada, 2022 FC 1517 at para. 25 (Glycobiosciences); UBS Group AG v Yones, 2022 FC 487 at paras. 7-10.\n[4] The Glycobiosciences decision cited by Messrs. Macciacchera goes on at paragraph 27 to state as follows:\nThe onus on the moving party to establish special circumstances is a high one. The moving party must provide clear and unambiguous evidence establishing special circumstances, and these circumstances must be unusual, uncommon and exceptional, and the result of external forces as distinct from the voluntary acts of the plaintiff (Alpha Marathon Technologies Inc v Dual Spiral Systems Inc, 2005 FC 1582 at para 4 (\u201cAlpha\u201d)).\n[5] Having carefully reviewed the submissions of Messrs. Macciacchera, I have concluded that their motion should be denied because they have failed to demonstrate that they cannot afford a lawyer, and hence they have not convinced me that special circumstances exist.\n[6] As stated in Alpha at paragraph 5, \u201c[t]he ability of [the moving party] to pay for legal representation is without a doubt the most important factor for the Court to consider.\u201d\n[7] As stated in El Mocambo Rocks Inc. v. Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN), 2012 FCA 98 at para. 4, \u201c[t]he demonstration that a corporation cannot afford a solicitor should usually be made by submitting complete and clear financial information concerning the corporation, preferably by means of financial statements.\u201d\n[8] Messrs. Macciacchera address the requirement that they cannot afford a lawyer at paragraph 11 of their written representations. Though they argue that they are committed to pursuing this appeal, and that many steps leading to a hearing have been completed, they do not allege that they cannot afford a lawyer. They provide no financial information whatsoever.\n[9] I recognize that the respondents do not oppose Messrs. Macciacchera\u2019s motion. However, though that may be a relevant factor in addressing a motion under Rule 120, it is not determinative. In this case, it does not outweigh the absence of evidence that Messrs. Macciacchera cannot afford a lawyer.\n[10] The dismissal of Messrs. Macciacchera\u2019s motion has implications for the progress of the present appeal. Without representation, the corporate appellants cannot act. Accordingly, I will order, just as Justice Donald J. Rennie did in his Order dated December 8, 2023, that they appoint new solicitors of record in accordance with Rule 124 within 30 days.\n[11] I note also that a requisition for hearing was filed on January 8, 2024. Though that document indicates that it is on behalf of all of the appellants, it cannot have been on behalf of the corporate appellants because they were not duly represented. Accordingly, I will order, just as Justice Rennie did in his Order dated December 8, 2023, that a fresh requisition for hearing under Rule 347 be filed within 30 days following retainer of new counsel.\n\"George R.

OVERVIEW [1] These reasons address the appeals of two decisions of the Federal Court (per Zinn J.) dismissing the appellant\u2019s motions for permanent stays of proceedings: a decision reported at 2023 FC 35 [Hudson Reasons] dismissing the appellant\u2019s motion for a permanent stay of the proposed class proceeding in Hudson v. Canada and a decision reported at 2023 FC 36 [Pierrot Reasons] dismissing the appellant\u2019s motion for a permanent stay of the proposed class proceeding in Pierrot v. Canada. All references to \u201cReasons\u201d in this decision are to the Hudson Reasons, unless otherwise indicated.\n[2] The appellant brought the motions on the basis that both Hudson and Pierrot are duplicative of already certified class proceedings, Greenwood v. Canada [Greenwood] and Association des membres de la police mont\u00e9e du Qu\u00e9bec v. Canada [AMPMQ]. All four proceedings involve allegations of workplace harassment and discrimination by RCMP management and employees, and claim damages.\n[3] The motion judge dismissed the Hudson motion, having determined that the focus of the proceedings in Hudson differed from those in Greenwood and AMPMQ. In Pierrot, the motion judge dismissed the motion for the reasons given in Hudson but ordered a temporary stay pending a final determination in Hudson: Pierrot Reasons at paras. 6-8.\n[4] The Greenwood plaintiffs intervened in the appeal of the Hudson motion decision to request that the appeal be allowed on the basis that Hudson is duplicative of Greenwood.\n[5] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeals.\nII. THE PARTIES AND THE PROCEEDINGS [6] As a central issue in these appeals is the scope of the class proceedings in Greenwood, AMPMQ, Hudson, and Pierrot, I briefly describe each of them.\nGreenwood [7] The Greenwood action was commenced in 2018. In January 2020, the Federal Court certified Greenwood as a class proceeding: 2020 FC 119. The Crown appealed to this Court, which upheld the certification but modified the class definition and the class period: 2021 FCA 186. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was refused: 2022 CanLII 19060 (S.C.C.). The modified certification order is reported at 2022 FC 1317 [Greenwood Certification Order]. A further amendment to the certification order, concerning the family class (2023 FC 397), was recently appealed to this Court, which allowed the appeal and remitted the matter to the certification judge: 2024 FCA 22.\n[8] Greenwood involves a claim in systemic negligence, including allegations that the RCMP failed to provide its employees \u201cwith a work environment free from bullying, intimidation, and harassment\u201d: Greenwood Certification Order at paras. 4-6.\n[9] The class includes: \u201cAll current or former RCMP Members (ie. Regular, Civilian, and Special Constable Members) and Reservists who worked for the RCMP between January 1, 1995 and the date a collective agreement becomes or became applicable to a bargaining unit to which they belong\u201d: Greenwood Certification Order at para. 2.\n[10] Greenwood excludes claims covered by Merlo v. Her Majesty the Queen [Merlo], Ross et al v. Her Majesty the Queen, and Tiller v. Her Majesty the Queen [Tiller], class proceedings that were settled. Claims covered by AMPMQ are also excluded.\nAMPMQ [11] The AMPMQ action was commenced in 2016. In August 2018, the Superior Court of Quebec certified (or, to use the language of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure, C.Q.L.R. c. C-25.01, \u201cauthorized\u201d) AMPMQ as a class proceeding in Delisle et al. c. Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine, 2018 QCCS 3855 [AMPMQ QCCS Decision]. The Quebec Court of Appeal upheld the certification: 2018 QCCA 1993.\n[12] AMPMQ involves allegations that the RCMP failed to provide a workplace free from \u201cabus de pouvoir\u201d (defined to include physical harassment, psychological harassment, retaliation, discrimination and all other forms of abuse of power), particularly in relation to French speakers and individuals who exercised their freedom of association and right to unionize: AMPMQ QCCS Decision at paras. 234-235.\n[13] The main class includes all members and civilian members of the RCMP that were victims of \u201cabus de pouvoir\u201d by a member of the RCMP Staff (as defined) and on the condition of fulfilling one of the following requirements: \u201chaving suffered the injury in Qu\u00e9bec; having suffered Injury resulting from a Fault committed by a Staff member then situated in Qu\u00e9bec; having to perform their duties for the RCMP in Qu\u00e9bec, at the time when the Injury was committed; or having their domicile or their residence in Qu\u00e9bec when they suffered the Injury\u201d: AMPMQ QCCS Decision at para. 234.\n[14] The AMPMQ class has two subclasses: (1) members of the main group who suffered the injury by reason of belonging to the language group of French speakers; and (2) members of the main group who suffered the injury by reason of their activities related to freedom of association and the right to unionize.\n[15] The class also excludes class members in Merlo: AMPMQ QCCS Decision at para. 234.\nHudson [16] Ms. Hudson was an RCMP member from 1979 to 2009. She commenced the Hudson action in the Federal Court, in July 2020. Ms. Hudson claims that she and other potential class members were subject to racism and racist acts by the RCMP, including demeaning comments, unequal access to benefits, and unequal opportunities for career progression. She says that she and other potential class members suffered career limitations, loss of income, and physical and psychological damage.\n[17] Ms. Hudson alleges that the RCMP breached the proposed class members\u2019 rights to equality under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11 and Quebec Charter of human rights and freedoms, C.Q.L.R., c. C-12; was systemically negligent; failed to apply the provisions of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. R-10, its regulations, and the Code of Conduct promulgated under the RCMP Act in a fair manner; and failed to act honourably and in good faith when dealing with Indigenous class members.\n[18] The proposed class consists of racialized individuals who worked for the RCMP between April 17, 1985 and the date of certification. The proposed class excludes any claims class members have that were resolved in Merlo, Tiller, Copland and Roach v. HMTQ, and Toss, Roy and Satalic v. HMTQ. The claim also excludes claims that class members have in Greenwood (unless that proceeding is decertified) and in AMPMQ (unless that proceeding is de-authorized).\n[19] The parties have filed their materials for the certification motion and await a hearing. In August 2022, the appellant served a notice of motion to strike Hudson on jurisdictional grounds, which it will seek to have heard at the same time as the certification hearing if unsuccessful in having Hudson stayed.\nPierrot [20] The Pierrot action was commenced in the Federal Court, in January 2022. Mr. Pierrot makes similar allegations to those in Hudson but is focused on Indigenous RCMP employees: Pierrot Reasons at para. 4.\n[21] Mr. Pierrot\u2019s counsel have agreed to work with Ms. Hudson\u2019s counsel. Mr. Pierrot has agreed to hold his action in abeyance if Hudson proceeds. Given this agreement between the plaintiffs, the motion judge ordered a stay \u201cpending a final determination in Hudson\u201d: Pierrot Reasons at para. 8.\nNo Carriage Motion [22] When two or more proposed class actions are commenced with respect to the same alleged wrongdoing and counsel are unable to agree on how to proceed, a plaintiff may bring a carriage motion. In a carriage motion, the court is asked to determine which counsel or group of counsel will have \u201ccarriage\u201d of the class action, while the other competing class actions are stayed: LaLiberte v. Day, 2020 FCA 119 at para. 1 [LaLiberte FCA Decision].\n[23] While the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106 [Rules] do not specifically provide for carriage motions, section 50 of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 and paragraph 105(b) of the Rules, read in light of rule 3, give the Federal Courts authority to stay duplicative class actions: LaLiberte v. Day, 2019 FC 766 at para. 36 [LaLiberte FC Decision]; LaLiberte FCA Decision at para. 10.\n[24] According to the interveners, no carriage motion was brought because when the Hudson and Pierrot actions were commenced, Greenwood and AMPMQ had been certified. Instead, the appellant brought motions to indefinitely stay Hudson and Pierrot.\nIII. THE MOTION DECISIONS [25] The motion judge confirmed the Federal Court\u2019s jurisdiction to grant the relief requested pursuant to section 50 of the Federal Courts Act and the Court\u2019s plenary jurisdiction to manage its own proceedings: Reasons at para. 9. The burden was on the moving party to demonstrate that granting a stay of Hudson would serve the interests of justice: Reasons at para. 11.\n[26] The motion judge accepted that if the factual foundation and issues raised in Hudson were duplicative of those in Greenwood and AMPMQ, a stay would likely prevent the costly duplication of judicial and legal resources, lessen the risk of inconsistent decisions, and reduce any prejudice to the appellant in having to defend against the same allegations in different proceedings: Reasons at para. 13.\n[27] In order to determine the extent of overlap, the motion judge considered the \u201cfocus\u201d of each proceeding, relying on the certification orders and decisions in Greenwood and AMPMQ and the pleadings in all of the proceedings.\n[28] The motion judge concluded that Hudson addressed different factual situations and legal issues than Greenwood and AMPMQ. The focus of the former was the impact of systemic racism and implicit misconduct, while the focus of Greenwood was bullying, intimidation, harassment, and explicit misconduct: Reasons at paras. 17, 19, and 27. The focus of AMPMQ was abuse of power based on discrimination resulting in injury because of harassment, psychological harassment, or retaliation: Reasons at para. 18. The motion judge found that there was little mention of racism and no mention of systemic racism in Greenwood or AMPMQ: Reasons at para. 24.\n[29] While acknowledging overlap between the proceedings, the motion judge determined that it would be unfair to Ms. Hudson to break her claim into pieces and require her to litigate them in different actions: Reasons at para. 31. Allowing Hudson to proceed was in the interests of justice. The motion was dismissed.\n[30] For the reasons issued in the Hudson motion, the motion to stay Pierrot was also dismissed: Pierrot Reasons at para. 6. As counsel for Mr. Pierrot agreed to hold the action in abeyance pending a final determination in Hudson, a temporary stay order was issued on that basis.\nIV. ISSUES [31] The central issue is whether the motion judge, in exercising the discretion under paragraph 50(1)(b) of the Federal Courts Act and refusing to stay Hudson and Pierrot, committed an error warranting this Court\u2019s intervention.\n[32] The appellant and the interveners submit that the motion judge made errors in law and in fact. They say that the motion judge erred in (a) failing to take into account the goals of class proceedings; (b) characterizing the legal claims in the various proceedings; and (c) characterizing the factual foundation of the claims.\nV. ANALYSIS (1) Legislation: paragraph 50(1)(b) of the Federal Courts Act\n[33] Part 5.1 of the Rules does not specifically provide for stays of class proceedings (whether proposed or certified, multi-jurisdictional or in the same jurisdiction). The motion judge\u2019s decision was rendered pursuant to paragraph 50(1)(b) of the Federal Courts Act, which applies to all proceedings. It provides:\n50 (1) The Federal Court of Appeal or the Federal Court may, in its discretion, stay proceedings in any cause or matter\n\u2026\n(b) where for any other reason it is in the interest of justice that the proceedings be stayed.\n50 (1) La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ont le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de suspendre les proc\u00e9dures dans toute affaire :\n[\u2026]\n(b) lorsque, pour quelque autre raison, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice l\u2019exige.\n[34] Support for the application of paragraph 50(1)(b) to a stay of class proceedings is found in LaLiberte where, in the context of a carriage motion, the Federal Court ordered the stay of proposed class proceedings under the authority of section 50 of the Federal Courts Act and paragraph 105(b) of the Rules: LaLiberte FC Decision at para. 85.\n(2) Standard of Review [35] The motion judge\u2019s decisions were discretionary. The standards of review are correctness for questions of law; palpable and overriding error for questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law \u2014 unless there is an extricable error of law, in which case correctness applies: Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, 2016 FCA 215 at para. 79; Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 [Housen].\n(3) Did the motion judge err by failing to give due weight to the goals of class proceedings? [36] The appellant submits that a court must consider the goals of class proceedings in exercising the discretion under paragraph 50(1)(b) in the context of class proceedings. The goals of class proceedings are access to justice, judicial economy, and behaviour modification: Hollick v. Toronto (City), 2001 SCC 68 at para. 15 [Hollick]; L\u2019Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal v. J.J., 2019 SCC 35 at para. 6.\n[37] The failure to identify or consider the legal criteria that govern the exercise of discretion may constitute an error of law: Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748 at para. 39, 144 D.L.R. (4th) 1; British Columbia (Minister of Forests) v. Okanagan Indian Band, 2003 SCC 71 at para. 43. Here, the appellant appears not to take issue with the motion judge\u2019s statement of the test for a stay of proceedings under paragraph 50(1)(b) but says that the failure to give due weight to the goals of class proceedings was a palpable and overriding error.\n[38] For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the motion judge considered the goals of class proceedings as part of the contextual analysis. It is not for this Court to reweigh the factors considered by the motion judge. There is no reversible error.\n[39] A stay ordered under paragraph 50(1)(b) is a matter of broad discretion: Mylan Pharmaceuticals ULC v. AstraZeneca Canada, Inc., 2011 FCA 312 at para. 5 [Mylan]; Clayton v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 1 at para. 24 [Clayton].\n[40] In Mylan, this Court distinguished between situations where a court is asked to enjoin another body from exercising its jurisdiction and those where the court is asked not to exercise its own jurisdiction until later. For the former, the tripartite test established in RJR-Macdonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311, 111 D.L.R. (4th) 385 applies. For the latter, the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d test governs: Mylan at para. 5; Clayton at para. 24. Here, as Hudson and Pierrot were commenced in the Federal Court, the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d test applies.\n[41] Under the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d test, there is no exhaustive list of factors that must be considered. The relevant factors will be determined by the context in which the stay request arises: Mylan at para. 5; Coote v. Lawyers\u2019 Professional Indemnity Company, 2013 FCA 143 at para. 10 [Coote]; Clayton at para. 26.\n[42] This approach is consistent with decisions of other appellate courts concerning the stay of class proceedings. The exercise of discretion should not be curtailed by rigid criteria: Herold v. Wassermann, 2022 SKCA 103 at para. 98, citing Leier v. Shumiatcher (No. 2), 1962 CanLII 330 (S.K. C.A.) at para. 2, 39 W.W.R. (N.S.) 446; Hamm v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 ABCA 329 at para. 11.\n[43] While there are no \u201chard and fast rules\u201d applicable to the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d test (Richards v. Canada, 2021 FC 231 at para. 10), certain guiding principles are to be taken into account, including the overarching objective of securing the \u201cjust, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every proceeding on the merits\u201d: Rules, rule 3. This reflects the public interest in proceedings moving in an efficient, timely, and fair manner, and avoiding the wasteful use of judicial resources: Mylan at para. 5; Coote at para. 13; Clayton at para. 28.\n[44] Although a court need not apply the RJR-Macdonald test, it may take into account some of the same considerations: Clayton at paras. 26-28; Viterra Inc. v. Grain Workers\u2019 Union (International Longshoreman\u2019s Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Local 333), 2021 FCA 41 at para. 23. Ultimately, the motion judge must protect against unfair prejudice to either party: Coote at para. 13. This necessarily involves a balancing of the prejudice to the moving party if the stay is not granted and prejudice to the opposing party if the action is stayed.\n[45] I am satisfied that the motion judge took these principles into account. The motion judge acknowledged many of these authorities and cited others for guidance on the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d test: Reasons at para. 10. The principles were applied with due consideration to Hudson and Pierrot being proposed class actions and Greenwood and AMPMQ already being certified.\n[46] A presumption of prejudice arises where overlap of class proceedings in the same jurisdiction is established \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201cintra-jurisdictional multiplicity\u201d of proceedings. There is no need to separately prove prejudice, although the presumption can be displaced with evidence to the contrary: Reid v. Google LLC, 2022 BCSC 158 at para. 140 [Google BCSC Decision], aff\u2019d Kett v. Google LLC, 2023 BCCA 350 [Google BCCA Decision] (this point was not challenged on appeal).\n[47] The motion judge correctly identified that the appellant\u2019s submissions rested on its view that Hudson and Pierrot were duplicative of Greenwood and AMPMQ. Multiple proceedings, whether individual actions or class proceedings, that litigate the same issue are inefficient and expensive, cause delay in the administration of justice, and waste scarce judicial and other resources: Vaeth v. North American Palladium Ltd., 2016 ONSC 5015 at para. 37; Apotex Inc. v. Bayer Inc., 2020 FCA 86 at para. 45. They entail the possibility of inconsistent results and can be prejudicial to a defendant, forced to defend the same allegations on multiple fronts. The need to avoid a multiplicity of class proceedings must, however, always be balanced with the objective of access to justice: Jensen v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., 2019 FC 373 at para. 22.\n[48] The motion judge conducted a balancing exercise, reviewing the potential prejudice to each party. More particularly, the motion judge considered judicial economy, acknowledging that a stay could prevent unnecessary costly duplication of judicial and legal resources: Reasons at para. 13. The motion judge also took into account access to justice and potential prejudice to the plaintiffs, noting that a stay would potentially require Ms. Hudson to litigate her claims in a piecemeal fashion: Reasons at paras. 30-31. The motion judge considered the potential prejudice to the defendant in having to potentially defend the same allegations on different fronts: Reasons at para. 13. Contrary to the appellant\u2019s submission, the motion judge did consider the class action goals of judicial economy and access to justice.\n[49] This was appropriate in the circumstances. It is not for this Court to review the weight given to those class action goals or engage in a rebalancing of the factors considered by the motion judge.\n[50] The motion judge made no error in identifying and considering the relevant principles governing the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d test.\n(4) Did the motion judge err in characterizing the claims and conducting the duplication analysis? [51] Having identified the test for granting a stay, the motion judge proceeded to consider the key issue \u2014 whether the proceedings were duplicative.\n[52] The essence of the appellant\u2019s submissions was that the factual foundation and the issues in Hudson and Pierrot are duplicative of those in Greenwood and AMPMQ: Reasons at para. 13. The motion judge analyzed the degree of overlap between the proceedings, relying on the record, including the pleadings in all of the proceedings and the certification orders and decisions in Greenwood and AMPMQ.\n[53] The appellant and the interveners submit that the motion judge committed several errors in the duplication analysis, in the legal and factual characterization of the claims. For the reasons that follow, I disagree.\n[54] I pause to briefly address the challenges that underlie the duplication analysis. There are no indications in the Federal Courts Act or Rules of criteria to be considered in determining the overlap in class proceedings (whether proposed or certified, multi-jurisdictional or in the same jurisdiction). By contrast, section 1.1 of the Ontario Class Proceedings Act, 1992, S.O. 1992, c. 6 [OCPA] provides:\n1.1 A determination under this Act as to whether two or more proceedings involve the same or similar subject matter shall include consideration of whether the proceedings involve the same or similar causes of action and the same or affiliated defendants.\n1.1 Toute d\u00e9cision rendue en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi sur la question de savoir si deux instances ou plus concernent le m\u00eame objet ou un objet similaire tient compte de la question de savoir si les instances concernent les m\u00eames causes d\u2019action ou des causes d\u2019action similaires et les m\u00eames d\u00e9fendeurs ou des d\u00e9fendeurs associ\u00e9s.\n[55] Here, the issue is the potential overlap between two proposed class proceedings (Hudson and Pierrot) and two already certified class proceedings (Greenwood and AMPMQ). Although AMPMQ is a Quebec proceeding, the issue of competing class proceedings in multiple jurisdictions, and the related issue of which claim or forum should be preferred, do not arise. Other considerations apply where a court is asked to stay one class proceeding in favour of a class proceeding in another Canadian jurisdiction: for example, OCPA, subsections 5(6) and (7); Class Proceedings Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 50, subsections 4(3) and (4).\n[56] A recent decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal addressed a situation, analogous to this case, in which multiple claims against the same defendant making similar allegations were commenced in the same jurisdiction. The Court confirmed the correct test to be whether the proceedings are about \u201cthe same dispute or subject matter\u201d: Google BCCA Decision at para. 61. This approach centres on the overlap in the legal issues \/ causes of action and damages claimed, and the factual foundations of the proceedings (e.g., whether the claims involve the same or similar events or transactions). Put differently, do the proceedings \u201ctraverse the same factual ground, allege the same wrongdoing and claim for the same loss\u201d?: Google BCSC Decision at para. 156.\n[57] The motion judge\u2019s approach was consistent with this guidance \u2014 relying on the \u201cfocus\u201d of each proceeding to capture both the relevant legal issues \/ causes of action and the facts supporting the claims.\n[58] Additional factors to consider in the duplication analysis may include whether the proceedings have some or all of the same class members, class periods, and the same (or affiliated) defendants. Here, the defendants are the same. The motion judge determined that the proceedings were sufficiently different without considering the potential for overlap in class membership or class periods. The motion judge concluded that these class issues should be left for the certification judge: Reasons at para. 28.\n[59] The critical part of the duplication assessment lies in determining how much overlap can be tolerated in allowing multiple actions to proceed, keeping in mind other procedural tools to coordinate the prosecution of claims. A Venn diagram depicting shaded areas of intersection springs to mind.\n[60] One can readily accept the proposition that \u201c[t]here cannot be two or more certified class actions in the same jurisdiction representing the same class in relation to the same claim\u201d: Mancinelli v. Barrick Gold Corporation, 2016 ONCA 571 at para. 11; Workman Optometry et al. v. Aviva Insurance et al., 2021 ONSC 142 at para. 33. However, it will rarely be this straightforward.\n[61] The analysis will invariably be highly case-specific, involving a characterization of pleadings and factual determinations. Determining the essential nature of claims is a question of mixed fact and law, reviewable on the highly deferential standard of palpable and overriding error, absent an extricable error of law: Apotex Inc. v. Canada (Health), 2012 FCA 322 at para. 9, citing Housen; Buffalo v. Canada, 2016 FCA 223 at para. 42; Canada (Attorney General) v. Scow, 2022 BCCA 275 at para. 76 [Scow]. A motion judge is to be afforded a wide berth in the duplication analysis, given the context-specific nature of the inquiry.\n(a) Alleged error in law: conflating implicit with systemic discrimination [62] The appellant and the interveners claim that the motion judge erred in characterizing the claims in Hudson and Greenwood by incorrectly conflating \u201cimplicit\u201d with \u201csystemic\u201d discrimination and relying on a bright line distinction between implicit \/ systemic discrimination on the one hand and explicit acts of discrimination on the other. They say that this was an error in law warranting this Court\u2019s intervention. I disagree.\n[63] Read fairly, the motion judge\u2019s reasons do not conflate systemic discrimination with implicit discrimination. At paragraph 22, the motion judge concludes that \u201cthe factual basis of systemic racism in Hudson is based on implicit misconduct, policies, and procedures that do not require explicit actions in order to be discriminatory.\u201d The comment in paragraph 24 that the focus of Hudson is \u201csystemic racism, an implicit misconduct\u201d must be understood in light of that earlier finding and should be read as \u201csystemic racism, in this case, an implicit misconduct.\u201d\n[64] The motion judge determined that Hudson, at its core, focuses on systemic racism. The misconduct alleged was not being considered for promotion and receiving lower remuneration and worse training, education and mentorship than non-racialized colleagues. Although there were allegations of explicitly discriminatory conduct directed at Ms. Hudson, the focus was on implicit misconduct \u2014 the discriminatory impact resulting from a failure to have or enforce adequate procedures, policies and guidelines to protect against racism: Reasons at paras. 19, 22, 24, and 27. \u201cIn Hudson, the Plaintiff merely had to exist and have certain immutable characteristics to suffer the alleged discrimination\u201d: Reasons at para. 27.\n[65] The motion judge determined that this made Hudson distinct from Greenwood, which focuses on \u201cbullying, intimidation, and harassment\u201d, and AMPMQ, which focuses on \u201cabuse[s] of power\u201d \u2014 particularly in relation to French-speaking employees and those who exercised their freedom of association and right to unionize: Reasons at paras. 17-18. The motion judge concluded that Greenwood involved unwanted physical touching, retaliation for complaining and demeaning and belittling comments. \u201cThe misconducts complained of in Greenwood were because an individual committed an act, such as filing a complaint or report\u201d: Reasons at para. 27. The motion judge concluded that there was no indication that systemic racism would be dealt with in Greenwood: Reasons at para. 29.\n[66] The motion judge used the terms \u201cexplicit\u201d and \u201cimplicit\u201d to differentiate between the types of misconduct alleged in Hudson and Pierrot on the one hand and Greenwood and AMPMQ on the other. This was part of an analysis of the factual foundation \u2014 the types of events giving rise to the claims in each proceeding. The terms were not used to underpin the motion judge\u2019s conclusion about the legal basis for the claims. The motion judge determined that the focuses of the claims were different \u2014 systemic racism or discrimination in Hudson and Pierrot, bullying, intimidation and harassment in Greenwood, and abuses of power in AMPMQ.\n[67] There is no error warranting this Court\u2019s intervention.\n(b) Alleged error in law: characterizing Greenwood and AMPMQ too narrowly [68] The appellant and the interveners acknowledge that the characterization of pleadings is usually a question of mixed fact and law. However, they submit that the motion judge erred in law by characterizing the claims in Greenwood and AMPMQ more narrowly than in the certification orders and decisions rendered by this Court and the Federal Court in Greenwood and by the Superior Court of Quebec in AMPMQ. They say that the impugned behaviour of the RCMP in each of Hudson, Pierrot, Greenwood, and AMPMQ stems from systemic negligence; the causes of action are the same. I disagree.\n[69] First, I do not accept that there is an extricable question of law. It is well-established that certification is not a determination of the merits of claims in a class proceeding: Hollick at para. 16; Pro\u2011Sys Consultants Ltd. v. Microsoft Corporation, 2013 SCC 57 at para. 99; Bowman v. Ontario, 2022 ONCA 477 at para. 37. Certification simply means that the action is appropriately prosecuted as a class proceeding: Hollick at para. 16.\n[70] The fact that the certification decisions or orders in Greenwood and AMPMQ contain descriptions of the claims in those proceedings does not change the nature of the characterization process undertaken by the motion judge. That remains a determination of mixed fact and law, based on the record.\n[71] Second, I do not accept the appellant and interveners\u2019 characterization of all four proceedings as being about \u201csystemic negligence\u201d or breaches of \u201ca duty of care to provide a non-injurious environment.\u201d This overly broad characterization ignores important differences that the motion judge identified and that find support in the statements of claim and the certification orders and decisions in Greenwood and AMPMQ.\n[72] The motion judge referred to the certification orders in Greenwood and AMPMQ. The motion judge cited the description of claims in the Greenwood certification order and then elaborated, based on a review of the pleadings, why the allegations in Hudson and Pierrot were not covered by Greenwood and AMPMQ: Reasons at paras. 3-8 and 16-19. There was ample support for this conclusion.\n[73] The Hudson amended statement of claim states that the action concerns systemic racism, and under the heading \u201cSystemic Negligence\u201d claims that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff and class members to ensure that they could work in an environment free of racism. Each particularized aspect of the duty of care is about racism and measures to protect or mitigate against the harmful effects of racism.\n[74] In contrast, the Greenwood statement of claim states that the action concerns systemic bullying, intimidation and harassment. The pleading refers to the statutory and institutional barriers, including the \u201cparamilitary structure\u201d of the RCMP that prevented collective bargaining and other means of obtaining meaningful redress for grievances. The particulars of the bullying, intimidation and harassment include sexually explicit comments; unwanted physical and\/or sexual exposure or touching; demeaning or belittling comments made about sexual orientation and to or about First Nations individuals, other non-Caucasian individuals, and those suffering from mental health issues; and retaliation against those who complained or reported bullying, intimidation or harassment.\n[75] While not mentioned in the motion judge\u2019s reasons, the common issues in the certification orders for Greenwood and AMPMQ and those proposed in Hudson further support the motion judge\u2019s determination. In Greenwood, the first common issue is: \u201cDid the RCMP \u2026 owe a duty of care to take reasonable steps in the operation or management of the Force to provide [class members] with a work environment free from bullying, intimidation and harassment?\u201d\n[76] In AMPMQ, the first common issue is: \u201cWere the RCMP and its staff obligated to respect the rights of the members under the Charters and to provide a workplace exempt from Abuse of power, including protection on the basis of belonging to the language group of French locutors or of their militancy in favour of freedom of association or the right to unionize?\u201d\n[77] In Hudson, a proposed common issue is: \u201cWas the \u2026 RCMP obligated to respect the Plaintiff and Class Members\u2019 rights under [the Charters] and to provide a workplace free from discrimination on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, colour and religion?\u201d\n[78] I find no error in the motion judge\u2019s approach to assessing the overlap in claims based on the \u201cfocus\u201d of each proceeding, as this included a consideration of both the causes of action and the underlying factual foundation in each of the proceedings. This approach finds support in the class actions context, where the issue has been described as whether proceedings involve the \u201csame dispute or subject matter\u201d: Google BCCA Decision at paras. 61-62. The approach also finds support in other contexts, where in characterizing claims, courts have determined that what matters is the \u201cessential character\u201d, based on realistic appreciation of the practical result sought by the plaintiff: JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc. v. Canada (National Revenue), 2013 FCA 250 at para. 50; Scow at para. 75; Weber v. Ontario Hydro, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 929 at para. 49, 24 O.R. (3d) 358; Roitman v. Canada, 2006 FCA 266 at para. 16 (all concerning jurisdiction); and Manuge v. Canada, 2010 SCC 67 at para. 19 (whether a proceeding should be brought as a judicial review application rather than an action).\n[79] The fact that the claims in Hudson and Greenwood both plead systemic negligence is not an answer to the duplication analysis. Two claims may plead systemic negligence in respect of the same organization, yet nonetheless be legally and factually distinct based on the different duties and standards of care and alleged breaches. As the motion judge concluded, Greenwood alleges a duty to provide a workplace free from bullying, intimidation and harassment; Hudson and Pierrot allege a duty to provide a workplace free from systemic racism.\n[80] It was open to the motion judge to conclude that the focus of the claims in Hudson and Pierrot differed from the focus of the claims in Greenwood and AMPMQ. There was no error in law in characterizing the claims.\n(c) Alleged error in the factual characterization of the pleadings [81] The appellant submits that the motion judge erred in distinguishing the factual basis for Hudson (and Pierrot) from the factual bases for Greenwood and AMPMQ. It says that Hudson (and Pierrot), like Greenwood and AMPMQ, involves allegations of explicit or overt acts of discrimination based on race. It also says that Greenwood and AMPMQ encompass workplace discrimination allegations, including systemic acts and omissions based on race. The appellant submits that the motion judge\u2019s errors were palpable and overriding.\n[82] Under the highly deferential standard of palpable and overriding error, appellate intervention is warranted only where an error is both obvious and determinative of the outcome: Salomon v. Matte-Thompson, 2019 SCC 14 at para. 33 [Salomon]; Mahjoub v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FCA 157 at paras. 61-75 [Mahjoub]. An appellate court must not reweigh the evidence that was before the motion judge and exercise discretion afresh: Salomon at para. 40; Mahjoub at paras. 70-79.\n[83] In my view, the appellant and the interveners have not identified an error that is obvious and \u201cgoes to the very core of the outcome of the case\u201d: Benhaim v. St\u2011Germain, 2016 SCC 48 at para. 38, citing Canada v. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 FCA 165. The motion judge\u2019s reasons, although brief, address the key differences between the factual foundations in Greenwood, AMPMQ, and Hudson and Pierrot and are supported by the record.\n[84] As discussed earlier in these reasons, the motion judge concluded that the factual foundation in Greenwood was explicit misconduct \u2014 bullying, intimidation and harassment in the form of unwanted touching, sexual exposure, belittling and demeaning comments. These misconducts occurred in retaliation for action taken by an individual, such as filing a complaint or report: Reasons at paras. 17 and 27. Although the allegations of harassment in Greenwood might include situations of race-based discrimination, the motion judge concluded that this was not the focus of the Greenwood proceeding; there was little mention of racism and no mention of systemic racism in Greenwood: Reasons at para. 24.\n[85] The motion judge acknowledged that Hudson included allegations of explicit misconduct but concluded that the factual foundation in Hudson was implicit misconduct \u2014 the failure to have or enforce adequate policies, procedures and guidelines to minimize the risk of being subjected to racism. The plaintiff suffered the consequences because she had \u201ccertain immutable characteristics\u201d that resulted in the discrimination: Reasons at paras. 19 and 27.\n[86] The motion judge\u2019s determination of the factual foundation of the proceedings and the areas of overlap are owed deference. No palpable and overriding error has been established. There is no basis for this Court to intervene.\n(5) Conclusion [87] There are potential areas of intersection between the proceedings \u2014 for example, between the claims in Hudson \/ Pierrot and Greenwood, for certain class members and periods, in the area of harassment based on race, and between Hudson \/ Pierrot and AMPMQ, in the area of harassment and discrimination based on race towards individuals with a connection to Quebec.\n[88] The motion judge recognized that the claims in Hudson \/ Pierrot and those in Greenwood \/ AMPMQ were not completely distinct: Reasons at paras. 16 and 30-31. However, the motion judge concluded that the areas of overlap did not outweigh the differences and declined to exercise the discretion to permanently stay Hudson and Pierrot. I see no error in that decision.\n[89] Greenwood and AMPMQ have been certified, but Hudson and Pierrot have not. The identifiable class and common questions remain to be determined in the latter proceedings. The motion judge made a discretionary decision in this context and, appropriately, exercised caution.\n[90] The motion judge observed that some of the duplication arguments made by the appellant were better left to the certification judge: Reasons at para. 28. At a certification hearing for Hudson, the Court will be required to address the concerns raised by the appellant in these appeals, including whether Hudson would involve claims that are the subject of any other proceeding: Rules, subsection 334.16(2).\n[91] In the context of a certification hearing, with additional information about the identifiable class(es), representative plaintiffs and common questions, the Court will be in a better position to assess the degree of overlap in the proceedings. At that time, the Court could consider whether a stay is warranted, if sought by the appellant, and other procedural tools available to limit potentially adverse consequences arising from the overlap.\n[92] As acknowledged at the hearing, there may be alternatives less draconian than a stay, including case management, that preserve a role for all of the plaintiffs, allowing the actions to advance without duplication. The Hudson claim already explicitly excludes any claims class members have in Greenwood (unless Greenwood is decertified) and in Delisle (AMPMQ) (unless Delisle (AMPMQ) is de-authorized), addressing the intersection of the Hudson claims with each of the Greenwood and AMPMQ claims. At or prior to a certification hearing in Hudson, these alternatives could be further pursued.\nVI.

(PCS) was entitled, in computing its income for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (the Act) for its taxation years 1999 to 2002, to deduct base payments paid to the province of Saskatchewan under The Mineral Taxation Act, 1983, S.S. 1983-84, c. M-17.1 (MTA) and The Potash Production Tax Schedule (PPTS) to the MTA.\n[2] The Tax Court of Canada (per Justice Owen, 2022 TCC 75) found that PCS was not entitled to deduct these base payments in computing its income for the taxation years under appeal.\n[3] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss this appeal.\nI. Background [4] The PPTS imposed a tax on potash produced from any lands in Saskatchewan that was sold or otherwise disposed of. There were two components of the tax: a base payment and a profit tax. Only the base payment is in issue in this appeal.\n[5] Section 5 of the PPTS set out the formula used to determine the amount of the base payment. The base payment was the rate of tax determined in accordance with the PPTS multiplied by the number of tonnes of potash sold or otherwise disposed of, minus certain permitted deductions (subsection 5(2) of the PPTS).\n[6] The rate of tax was based on a prescribed percentage of the profits for a particular year divided by the number of tonnes of potash sold or otherwise disposed of in that year (subsection 5(3) of the PPTS). The PPTS prescribed a maximum and a minimum rate of tax (subsections 5(4) and 5(5) of the PPTS). To determine whether the rate of tax for PCS for a particular year fell within or outside the range between the minimum and maximum rate of tax, PCS determined the prescribed percentage of its profits for that year and then divided this amount by the number of tonnes of potash that it sold in that year. The rate of tax for PCS as calculated in accordance with the formula for each year under appeal exceeded the maximum rate of tax as prescribed. Therefore, the maximum rate of tax prescribed by the PPTS was used as the rate of tax for each year.\n[7] PCS paid the following base payments for the years under appeal:\nTaxation Year\nBase Payment\n1999\n$14,643,226\n2000\n$16,454,834\n2001\n$14,673,344\n2002\n$13,655,538\n[8] PCS did not claim a deduction for the base payments in filing its tax returns for the years under appeal. Following the decision of the Tax Court in Cogema Resources Inc. v The Queen, 2004 TCC 750 (Cogema) (which was affirmed on appeal (2005 FCA 316)), PCS requested a reduction in its income to reflect the base payments. This request was refused by the Minister of National Revenue (the Minister), which resulted in the appeal that was heard by the Tax Court.\nII. Decision of the Tax Court [9] PCS argued before the Tax Court that it was entitled to deduct the base payments in computing its profit for the purposes of subsection 9(1) of the Act and that neither paragraph 18(1)(a) nor paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act applied to deny this deduction. If either paragraph 18(1)(a) or paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act applied to deny this deduction, that would have been sufficient to dismiss PCS\u2019 appeal.\n[10] Paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act is a general prohibition on claiming a deduction for an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made for the purpose of earning income:\n18 (1) In computing the income of a taxpayer from a business or property no deduction shall be made in respect of\n18 (1) Dans le calcul du revenu du contribuable tir\u00e9 d\u2019une entreprise ou d\u2019un bien, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants ne sont pas d\u00e9ductibles :\n(a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from the business or property;\na) les d\u00e9penses, sauf dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es ou effectu\u00e9es par le contribuable en vue de tirer un revenu de l\u2019entreprise ou du bien;\n[11] The Tax Court Judge found that the deduction of the base payments was denied pursuant to paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act because either:\n(a)the base payment was a tax \u201con the income of a producer from sales or other dispositions of potash mined in Saskatchewan\u201d (paragraph 72 of his reasons); or\n(b)\u201cthe base payment is not incurred by [PCS] for the purpose of gaining or producing income from its potash mining business; rather, it is a tax that is applied only after the conclusion of the process of earning income from that business\u201d (paragraph 73 of his reasons).\n[12] Paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act was repealed in 2003, effective for taxation years that began after 2007. For the purposes of this appeal, paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act would have prohibited the deduction by PCS of the base payment if the base payment could reasonably have been considered to be in relation to the production of potash by PCS. Paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act was amended during the taxation years under appeal. The full text of the two versions of paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act that were applicable during the taxation years under appeal are set out in paragraphs 75 and 76 of the Tax Court Judge\u2019s reasons.\n[13] Although it was not necessary to consider whether paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act applied, the Tax Court Judge summarizes his conclusion that the base payment was made in relation to the production of potash:\n[86] I similarly have no difficulty concluding that a \u201csale or other disposition of\u201d potash is an activity that relates to the production of that potash. There is a direct and immediate connection between the production of potash and the subsequent sale or disposition of that potash. To find otherwise would be to ignore the commercial objective of any mining venture, which is to mine and produce minerals to obtain the value of those minerals through sale, consumption, or use. The fact that the base payment arises after a sale or other disposition of potash does not preclude it being in relation to the production of that potash.\n[14] As a result, the Tax Court dismissed the appeal of PCS.\nIII. Issue and Standard of Review [15] The issues raised by PCS in this appeal are:\n(a)whether paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act precluded PCS from deducting the base payments in computing its income; and\n(b)whether paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act precluded PCS from deducting the base payments in computing its income.\n[16] PCS is not challenging any findings of fact made by the Tax Court Judge. The only issue is the interpretation of these provisions of the Act. As a result, the standard of review is correctness (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33).\nIV. Analysis [17] In order for PCS to be successful in this appeal, it would be necessary to find that neither paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act nor paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act prohibited the deduction of the base payments by PCS.\n[18] As noted above, paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act is a general limitation that restricts a deduction for an outlay or expense to the amount thereof that was made or incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income from a business or property. If the base payments were not made or incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income from the business being carried on by PCS, then they cannot be deducted in computing the income of PCS.\n[19] The formula to calculate the base payment was the rate of tax multiplied by the quantity of potash sold or otherwise disposed of (subsection 5(2) of the PPTS). While the PPTS prescribed a minimum rate of tax (and therefore, even if there was no profit, there would still be a rate of tax), there was no prescribed minimum quantity of potash sold or otherwise disposed of. If no potash was sold or otherwise disposed of in a particular year, there would be no base payment for that year.\n[20] Therefore, in order to incur the base payment, PCS had to sell or otherwise dispose of potash. As noted by the Tax Court Judge (at paragraph 6 of his reasons), PCS only produced potash for sale. The witness for PCS at the Tax Court hearing also confirmed that the base payment was calculated based on the quantity of potash that was sold. As a result, the base payment was only incurred by PCS as a result of a sale of potash by PCS. There was no \u201cother disposition\u201d of potash by PCS.\n[21] Since the issue in this appeal is whether PCS can deduct the base payment in determining its income for the purposes of the Act, what resulted in the base payment being incurred by PCS is relevant. The application of the base payment to a different taxpayer, who may have incurred the base payment as a result of some other event that would be considered to be a disposition for the purposes of the PPTS, is not relevant in determining whether PCS is entitled to the deduction. The tax consequences to PCS are to be determined based on what PCS did that resulted in it incurring the base payment. As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Shell Canada Ltd. v. Canada, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 622, 4 C.T.C. 313, at paragraph 45:\nUnless the Act provides otherwise, a taxpayer is entitled to be taxed based on what it actually did, not based on what it could have done, and certainly not based on what a less sophisticated taxpayer might have done.\n[22] PCS labels as \u201cred herrings\u201d the Tax Court Judge\u2019s focus on the base payment only being incurred on a sale of potash and the requirement to use the profit of PCS to determine if the rate of tax would be the minimum tax rate, the maximum tax rate or somewhere in between. PCS argues that it could not carry on business if it did not pay the base payment.\n[23] However, the argument that not paying the base payment could result in PCS not being able to continue to carry on its business is based on the consequences of not paying the base payment, and not on whether the base payment was incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income. The same argument concerning the consequences of failing to pay the base payment could also be made with respect to provincial income taxes. If a person were to not pay provincial income taxes incurred as a result of carrying on a business, the particular province may well commence collection actions, which could result in the closure of the business.\n[24] However, there is no dispute that provincial income taxes are not deductible in computing income for the purposes of the Act. In Roenisch v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue - M.N.R.) (1930), [1931] Ex.C.R. 1, at page 4, [1931] 2 D.L.R. 90, (Roenisch) Justice Audette stated:\nIt is self-evident that the amount of the income tax paid to the province is not an expense for the purpose of earning the income, within the meaning of 6a [now paragraph 18(1)(a)]. When such payment of taxes is made to the province, it is not so made to earn the income, it is paid because there is an income showing gain and profit.\n[25] This argument that the failure to pay a tax that could lead to the possible consequence of losing a business is not sufficient, in and of itself, to establish that the base payment was incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income.\n[26] PCS, in paragraph 47 of its memorandum, submits that the Tax Court should have considered the following paragraph from Roenisch, [1931] Ex.C.R. 1, at page 5:\nAs was said, in the case of The Crown v. D. and W. Murray Ltd. [(1909) 11 W.A. Law Reports 92, at p. 95], the remarks made by Sir Henry James, when Attorney-General, in the case of Last v. London Assurance Corporation [(1885) 10 A.C. 438], apply to the present case. He says:\nThe test is this \u2015 if there is an expenditure which would be made in any case, from which profits may accrue, the expenditure may be deducted; but an expenditure which will not be incurred unless there is a profit is not an expenditure in order to earn a profit.\n[emphasis was added by PCS in its memorandum]\n[27] PCS, in addressing this test in its memorandum, does not refer to the first part of the test which described \u201can expenditure which would be made in any case, from which profits may accrue\u201d. Therefore, PCS does not address how income or profits could accrue from making the base payment.\n[28] Instead, PCS focuses on the obligation to pay the base payment even if PCS did not realize a profit (because the PPTS prescribed a minimum rate of tax). There are two responses to this argument.\n[29] First, this argument does not take into account the second component of the formula to determine the amount of the base payment. The base payment is the rate of tax multiplied by the number of tonnes of potash sold or otherwise disposed of. PCS only incurred the base payment because it sold potash, which resulted in income being gained. If PCS did not sell any potash, then no base payment would be incurred.\n[30] The second response to PCS\u2019 argument related to Roenisch is that the argument appears to equate income with profit for the purposes of paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act. However, paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act refers to income. The word profit does not appear in this paragraph. The test under paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act is whether the base payment was made or incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income. Therefore, the meaning of \u201cincome\u201d for the purposes of paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act is relevant.\n[31] In Ludco Enterprises Ltd. v. Canada, 2001 SCC 62, the Supreme Court noted that the Act does not define \u201cincome\u201d:\n[57] The Income Tax Act does not define the term \u201cincome\u201d. The Act speaks of \u201cnet income\u201d, \u201ctaxable income\u201d, and income from different sources, but it neither identifies nor describes the legal characteristics of \u201cincome\u201d; it only speaks of what is to be included or excluded from income. Similarly, tax theorists have proposed many different definitions of \u201cincome\u201d distinguishable by their varying degrees of inclusiveness. The common feature of all the definitions of income, whether derived from tax law, economic theory or the dictionary, is that \u201cincome\u201d is a measure of gain: see V. Krishna, The Fundamentals of Canadian Income Tax (6th ed. 2000), at pp. 97-100.\n[32] The Supreme Court concluded, at paragraph 61, that \u201cincome\u201d, for the purposes of paragraph 20(1)(c) of the Act, \u201cdoes not refer to net income, but to income subject to tax. In this light, it is clear that \u2018income\u2019 in s. 20(1)(c)(i) refers to income generally, that is, an amount that would come into income for taxation purposes, not just net income\u201d.\n[33] In Novopharm Ltd. v. Canada, 2003 FCA 112, Justice Rothstein, writing on behalf of this Court, concluded that the comments of the Supreme Court in Ludco applied equally to the meaning of \u201cincome\u201d in paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act:\n[20] The Minister submits that paragraph 18(1)(a) is generally aimed at deductions of outlays which are not profit motivated. However, I think the rationale outlined by Iacobucci J. in Ludco, as to why income in subparagraph 20(1)(c)(i) is not equivalent to profit or net income, is equally applicable to paragraph 18(1)(a). Nowhere in the language of paragraph 18(1)(a) is a quantitative test suggested. Nor is there any support in the words of paragraph 18(1)(a) that suggests a judicial assessment of the sufficiency of income. And, as with subparagraph 20(1)(c)(i), such an assessment would be too subjective where certainty is to be preferred. For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the view of Pigeon J. in Lipson, supra, to the extent that it may have been applied to paragraph 18(1)(a), must now be considered to have been superseded by the rationale in Ludco.\n[34] Therefore, \u201cincome\u201d, for the purposes of paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act, does not mean \u201cprofit\u201d or \u201cnet income\u201d. Rather, \u201cincome\u201d, for the purposes of paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act, means an amount that would be included in computing income for the purposes of the Act. As a result, in applying the test adopted by the Exchequer Court in Roenisch (\u201can expenditure which will not be incurred unless there is a profit is not an expenditure in order to earn a profit\u201d) to paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act, the references to \u201cprofit\u201d must be read as \u201cincome\u201d. The test would then be:\n\u2026 if there is an expenditure which would be made in any case, from which [income] may accrue, the expenditure may be deducted; but an expenditure which will not be incurred unless there is [income] is not an expenditure in order to earn [income].\n[35] For PCS, the base payment was an expenditure that would not have been incurred unless it sold potash, which produced income. The base payment was therefore not an expenditure in order to earn income.\n[36] PCS refers to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Harrods (Buenos Aires), Ltd. v. Taylor-Gooby (Inspector of Taxes) (1964), 41 T.C. 450, 43 A.T.C. 6 (CA). In that case, Harrods (Buenos Aires), Ltd. (Harrods) was incorporated in the United Kingdom and carried on business in Argentina. Argentina imposed a tax on the capital of corporations that carried on business in Argentina through an \u201cempresa estable\u201d. The premises where Harrods carried on its business was an \u201cempresa estable\u201d. The tax was paid regardless of whether the corporation earned a profit.\n[37] All three judges of the Court of Appeal, in separate reasons, agreed that the tax was deductible by Harrods in computing its income for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (UK), 1952, 15 & 16 Geo VI & I Eliz II, c. 10. Wilmer, L.J., stated at page 466:\nIt was the establishment of the \u201cempresa estable\u201d which attracted the tax, which was payable regardless of whether profits were, in fact, made \u2026 Liability to the tax in the present case was an incident to the establishment of the Company's \u201cempresa estable\u201d, and as such it was a liability incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade carried on there.\n[38] Harrods\u2019 liability to pay the tax did not arise on the sale of any products, but rather simply by having the establishment in Argentina. Diplock, L.J. confirmed the significance of the imposition of the tax in Argentina as a result of Harrods having an establishment there (at page 469):\nLiability to the tax does not depend upon whether profits are made or not. It is a payment which the company is compelled to make if it has a business establishment in the Argentine at all, and it must have a business establishment if it is to carry on its trade.\n[39] The tax was imposed in Argentina as a result of Harrods simply having an establishment in that country. Therefore, there is a significant distinction between the tax under consideration in Harrods (Buenos Aires), Ltd. v. Taylor-Gooby (Inspector of Taxes) and the base payment imposed by the Province of Saskatchewan. While in both cases the tax is imposed regardless of whether the taxpayer has a profit, the triggering event for the imposition of the tax in Argentina was the establishment of a store in Argentina by Harrods. In this appeal, the triggering event is not the establishment of a mine in Saskatchewan, but the sale of potash. PCS gained or produced its income by selling potash. The base payment was not incurred for the purpose of making the sale of potash; rather, it was incurred as a consequence of the sale of potash.\n[40] PCS also argues that Cogema confirms that a tax on the value of potash sold is deductible. In Cogema, the amounts in issue were paid under The Corporation Capital Tax Act (Saskatchewan), S.S. 1979-80 c. C-38.1 (the surcharge). The surcharge in Cogema was imposed on the value of the sales of uranium yellowcake. As noted by the Tax Court Judge, at paragraph 6, \u201c[t]he surcharge was not paid at the time of production of the ore or of the yellowcake. It was paid at the time of sale of that yellowcake\u201d.\n[41] The only provision of the Act that was in issue in Cogema was paragraph 18(1)(m). In particular, the issue was whether the surcharge was paid in relation to the production of minerals. The Tax Court Judge found that the surcharge was in relation to the sale of minerals and not the production of minerals:\n[15] \u2026 the surcharge related to Cogema\u2019s actual sale of the mineral and not its right to remove the mineral from the ground. The surcharge was a sales tax and was in relation to the sale of minerals, not the production of minerals.\n[42] Paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act was not considered by the Tax Court in Cogema. The Tax Court Judge simply referred the matter back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment. The Tax Court Judge did not state that the amounts in issue were deductible in computing Cogema\u2019s income:\n[16] The appeals are allowed and these matters are referred back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment pursuant to these Reasons.\n[43] In dismissing the appeal in Cogema, this Court provided brief reasons supporting the conclusion that the surcharge was a tax in relation to the sale of minerals and not the production of minerals:\n[1] We have not been persuaded that the amounts paid by the respondent pursuant to the Corporation Capital Tax Act of Saskatchewan (the Saskatchewan Act) in respect of which the respondent sought a deduction under the Income Tax Act constitute amounts that may reasonably be regarded as being in relation to the production in Canada of minerals.\n[2] Rather, we agree with Beaubier J., that the amounts paid by the respondent to the Province of Saskatchewan under the Saskatchewan Act were taxes in relation to sales of minerals and not the production of minerals.\n[44] Since in Cogema neither the Tax Court nor this Court considered paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act, Cogema does not assist in determining whether a tax in relation to the sale of minerals was incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income.\n[45] In this appeal, PCS gained or produced income by selling potash. The base payments were imposed based on the quantity of potash sold by PCS in a particular year. The base payments were not made or incurred for the purpose of making any sale of potash, but rather as a consequence of making such sale. Hence, the base payments were not made or incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income but rather as a result of PCS gaining or producing income by selling potash.\n[46] Since paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act results in a denial of the deduction in issue, there is no need to consider whether paragraph 18(1)(m) of the Act would also have denied such deduction.\n[47] As a result, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\u201cWyman W.

The undertaking applies automatically and until the information is used in open court or is otherwise made public: Juman v. Doucette, 2008 SCC 8; Fibrogen, Inc. v. Akebia Therapeutics, Inc., 2022 FCA 135. However, the Court may relieve against the undertaking if the applicant demonstrates that the interests of justice served by doing so outweigh the values the implied undertaking is intended to protect: Juman at paras. 32-34.\n[2] The appellant, Iris Technologies Inc., commenced an appeal in the Tax Court of Canada. The Tax Court appointed a case management judge before whom the appellant brought a motion seeking confirmation that the implied undertaking did not apply to seven documents the respondent provided. If it did apply, the appellant sought relief from it.\n[3] The Tax Court judge dismissed the motion for reasons delivered orally on November 18, 2022. The appellant appeals that decision asserting that the judge erred in concluding that the implied undertaking applied. If he did not so err, says the appellant, he erred in failing to grant the appellant relief.\n[4] As it did before the Tax Court judge, the appellant argues here that the respondent was not compelled to produce the documents. The Tax Court judge disagreed, finding the respondent provided them \u201cpursuant to the Appellant\u2019s Notice to Attend served under the rules\u201d which \u201cplaced an obligation on the Respondent to produce the seven documents\u201d such that they were produced \u201cin the course of the Discovery process\u201d. The Tax Court judge found no exception applied. The record fully supports these conclusions. See also Fibrogen at paras. 53-59.\n[5] We see no merit to the appellant\u2019s submission that the Tax Court judge\u2019s findings \u2013 regarding the appellant\u2019s purpose in requesting the documents \u2013 were made without evidence. There is ample evidence in the record to support those findings.\n[6] Finally, the appellant submits the Tax Court judge erred in law in not granting it relief from the implied undertaking. The error, says the appellant, is not a failure to balance the required interests, but a failure to follow jurisprudence the appellant describes as \u201cdispositive\u201d of the interest that prevails in this case.\n[7] We cannot agree with the appellant\u2019s characterization of that jurisprudence which, as the Tax Court judge observed, was not binding on the Tax Court. Moreover, a court must always balance the relevant interests in context with reference to the particular facts: Juman at para. 32; Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of the Province of British Columbia v. Engineer X, 2023 BCCA 211 at paras. 27-28. Accordingly, the result of the balancing exercise in another case is not determinative.\n[8] We add that the appellant has not established a present need for the information covered by the implied undertaking in another proceeding that is actively being prosecuted.\n[9] We agree with the parties that the appellate standard of review applies to this appeal: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33. Having regard to that standard, and having carefully reviewed the record and considered the appellant\u2019s submissions, we see no error warranting our intervention. Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal with costs in the all-inclusive agreed amount of $3,000.\n\"K.A.

RAFIQUE\nAppellant\nand\nMINISTER OF NATIONAL REVENUE\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\n(Delivered from the Bench at Toronto, Ontario, on February 28, 2024).\nBIRINGER J.A.\n[1] The appellant, Ehtesham Rafique, appeals an interlocutory order of the Tax Court (per Rossiter C.J.). The appellant brought a motion to strike the Minister\u2019s reply and have the income tax assessments for his 1994 and 1995 years vacated. The Tax Court dismissed the motion, providing oral reasons.\n[2] The standards of review for the Tax Court\u2019s decision are those in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33: correctness for questions of law, and palpable and overriding error for questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law where there is no extricable legal error: Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, 2016 FCA 215 at para. 79; Canada v. Preston, 2023 FCA 178 at para. 12. A palpable and overriding error is an error that is obvious and determinative of the outcome: Salomon v. Matte-Thompson, 2019 SCC 14 at para. 33; Mahjoub v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FCA 157 at paras. 61-75.\n[3] On the motion, the appellant asked for a writ of mandamus, a remedy that the Tax Court correctly determined it had no jurisdiction to grant: Canada v. Dow Chemical Canada ULC, 2022 FCA 70 at para. 89; Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, subsection 18(1). However, the Tax Court judge appropriately looked beyond that request to consider the substance of the appellant\u2019s motion, which was to have the assessments vacated. The Tax Court concluded that there was no basis to do so.\n[4] The appellant submits that the Tax Court judge made errors in law in rendering the decision, by failing to admit certain evidence on the motion, by relying on certain cases regarding rule 170.1 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure), SOR\/90-688a, which the appellant views as distinguishable, and by refusing to decide on the motion the substantive issues in the tax appeal. We find these submissions to be without merit.\n[5] The Tax Court judge considered whether rule 170.1 applied. As this Court explained in Georgeson Shareholder Communications Canada Inc. v. Canada, 2020 FCA 139 at para. 9, rule 170.1 allows a party to apply for judgment at any stage in a proceeding where \u201cthere is nothing in controversy, either regarding the facts or a fairly arguable legal issue.\u201d It may apply, for example, where there has been an admission in the pleadings.\n[6] The appellant had argued that the Minister\u2019s alleged admission of failing to reconsider the appellant\u2019s assessment \u201cwith all due dispatch\u201d following a notice of objection (as required by subsection 165(3) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.)) warranted the assessments being vacated. The Tax Court judge disagreed, relying on applicable case law.\n[7] We agree with this conclusion. As this Court has confirmed, the Minister\u2019s failure to act \u201cwith all due dispatch\u201d is not a basis for overturning an assessment; the taxpayer\u2019s remedy is to appeal directly to the Tax Court under paragraph 169(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act: Ford v. Canada, 2014 FCA 257 at para. 19, citing Bolton v. The Queen, [1996] 3 C.T.C 3, 200 N.R. 303.\n[8] The Tax Court judge rejected the appellant\u2019s other arguments to have the assessments vacated, finding that there were still several issues in controversy in the tax appeal with respect to the deductibility of expenses and the imposition of late filing penalties. While commenting on the appellant\u2019s arguments on the latter, the Tax Court judge determined that these factual and legal issues were not to be determined on an interlocutory motion but at trial. There, the relevant evidence can be weighed, the Minister\u2019s assumptions challenged, and the legal issues resolved. We see no reviewable error in this conclusion.\n[9] The appellant\u2019s reliance in this Court on rules 167 and 169 as authority for the Tax Court judge to rule on the substantive issues is entirely misplaced. Those rules address the process by which judgments of the Tax Court are issued and do not provide for the disposition of an appeal on an interlocutory motion.\n[10] We find no error warranting this Court\u2019s intervention. Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal, with costs.\n\u201cMonica Biringer\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nEHTESHAM A RAFIQUE v.

AND MG FREESITES LTD.\nAppellants\nAnd\nPRIVACY COMMISSIONER OF CANADA\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\n(Delivered from the Bench at Toronto, Ontario, on February 29, 2024).\nSTRATAS J.A.\n[1] The appellants appeal from an order of the Federal Court: 2023 FC 1428 (per McDonald J.). The Federal Court dismissed the appellants\u2019 motion for injunctive relief and for an order extending earlier orders of the Federal Court that imposed confidentiality and a publication ban.\n[2] These matters stem from preliminary findings and recommendations made by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c. 5 concerning the appellants\u2019 handling of personal information. These preliminary findings and recommendations were expressed in the Commissioner\u2019s preliminary report and a later letter revising some aspects of the report and advising of his decision to publish the final report.\n[3] The appellants have applied for judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The appellants brought the motion, now before us, within that judicial review. The appellants argued that the Commissioner needed to be enjoined from publishing his findings and recommendations. They argued that without injunctive relief, their reputation would be irreparably harmed and their judicial review would be rendered moot.\n[4] Applying the classic test for injunctive relief in RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311, the Federal Court found that the appellants had failed to establish irreparable harm with the evidence they adduced. The evidence was general, broad, unparticularized, unspecific, and relatively sparse\u2014in short, insufficient and inadequate and, thus, well short of the mark. The Federal Court added that the appellants \u201cdid not offer any evidence to establish that such public exposure [as a result of the disclosure of the Commissioner\u2019s final report would have]\u2026 an impact on their business in a manner that would take it outside the normal impact of the Commissioner\u2019s proceedings\u201d (at para. 48). In other words, there was evidence of harm but the evidence was of such generality and non-specificity that it was not possible to infer or conclude that the harm would be irreparable.\n[5] From that, the Federal Court concluded that the appellants failed to establish harm of sufficient quality or weight to show that the balance of convenience was in their favour. The Federal Court added that the pursuit of the Commissioner\u2019s mandate was very much in the public interest and that weighed heavily against the appellants in any assessment of the balance of convenience.\n[6] Applying the standards governing court openness in Sierra Club of Canada v. Canada (Minister of Finance), 2002 SCC 41, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 522 and Sherman Estate v. Donovan, 2021 SCC 25, the Federal Court issued a restricted confidentiality order largely to protect the strong privacy interests of the complainant before the Privacy Commissioner. It also discontinued an earlier publication ban.\n[7] In this Court, the appellants successfully obtained a stay of the Federal Court\u2019s order pending this appeal. As will be discussed, portions of this file and the hearing of this appeal have been subject to confidentiality and publication orders and other orders and directions, largely to ensure that the appellants\u2019 appeal, aimed at preventing disclosure, did not become moot through disclosure.\n[8] We will dismiss this appeal.\n[9] The Federal Court did not err in law in making the order it did. It properly identified and applied the applicable law.\n[10] The appellants have failed to show that the Federal Court\u2019s application of the law to the evidence was tainted by a reviewable error within the meaning of Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. Under Housen, the Federal Court\u2019s assessment of the weight of evidence is reviewable only for palpable and overriding error. The appellants have demonstrated no such error. This Court does not reweigh the evidence before the Federal Court, nor does it substitute its view of the facts for that of the Federal Court.\n[11] We do not accept the appellant\u2019s submission that the Federal Court\u2019s evidentiary findings were affected by a misunderstanding and misapplication of Newbould v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FCA 106, [2018] 1 F.C.R. 590 and Glooscap Heritage Society v. Canada (National Revenue), 2012 FCA 255.\n[12] We add that even if the standard of review on evidentiary findings were more favourable to the appellants and we could reweigh and reassess the evidence, in our view, substantially for the reasons given by the Federal Court, the evidence was indeed deficient, insufficient, and inadequate to establish irreparable harm. From evidence of this quality, it was not possible for the Federal Court nor would it be possible for us to infer that the harm would be irreparable. To attempt to do so would put the courts in the realm of speculation, assumption or guesswork about the quality of the harm the appellants would suffer and, thus, whether it is irreparable. Whether the Commissioner could redact portions of any report to eliminate irreparable harm pending legal challenge could affect the assessment of irreparable harm. As well, further affecting that assessment is the fact that some of the information the appellants seek to keep confidential is already public in media reports. The overall result is evidentiary uncertainty.\n[13] We are also not persuaded that if this appeal is dismissed the judicial review pending in the Federal Court would become moot.\n[14] Both the appellants and the respondent filed motions to admit fresh evidence in the appeal. The appellants\u2019 motion was said to be dependent on the respondent\u2019s motion. As we are dismissing this appeal, both motions are now moot.\n[15] This is sufficient to determine this appeal and the motions. However, a few words need to be said about the challenges posed by the open court principle in appeals such as this. Our words are not specifically directed to the counsel in this case but rather to courts and the legal profession at large.\n[16] The open court principle is of constitutional force, essential in a democratic state, and has been described as the \u201cvery soul of justice\u201d: Sierra Club at paras. 36, 52 and 86; Sherman Estate at para. 1; Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 480 at para. 22. The guidance in these cases is firm, binding and clear, a prescription for all participants in the justice system to follow.\n[17] This appeal presented an unusual challenge. Before us was a difficult chicken-and-egg situation: under appeal was an order denying parties\u2019 request for confidentiality based on evidence that itself was said to be confidential. But undue openness and disclosure in the appeal would render moot the appellants\u2019 appeal seeking confidentiality. Despite this, in the end, after eight directions and orders issued by this Court in the last month, much openness was achieved, making it possible for public observers to appreciate the nature of what was taking place.\n[18] As for the hearing in this case, we emphasized the need to keep it as open as possible and the closed session as short as possible. To this end, only a five-minute portion was held in closed session.\n[19] In cases like this, all in the justice system must keep the open court principle front of mind. For example, counsel must remember that they are officers of the court, ethically bound to further the administration of justice and the public\u2019s confidence in it. Counsel must work with the Court to ensure that the Court\u2019s proceedings are as open as possible.\n[20] In particular, all must follow strictly the guidelines\u2014open to interpretation and occasional difficulties of application\u2014as they are set out in Sierra Club and Sherman Estate. Among other things, in exceptional cases\u2014and truly exceptional they must be\u2014where the need for confidentiality has an important public dimension as explained in these cases, confidentiality must nevertheless be minimized. In this regard, where possible\u2014and it almost always is\u2014public versions of confidential material must be filed alongside confidential material and the redactions in the confidential material must be minimized in accordance with a strict reading of the governing confidentiality order.\n[21] This Court regularly reviews its practices in cases involving confidential evidence\u2014especially in particularly challenging cases such as this\u2014to ensure that our proceedings are as open as possible, in accordance with Sierra Club, Sherman Estate and the fundamental constitutional imperatives that underlie them.\n[22] For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss the motions and the appeal, all with costs to the respondent, fixed by agreement at $10,000 all inclusive.\n\u201cDavid Stratas\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-297-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\n9219-1568 QUEBEC INC.

The appellant alleged various intentional torts and breaches of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11 (the Charter) by his employer, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and certain employees. The Federal Court (Ebadi v. Canada, 2022 FC 834 per Brown J.) struck the action, holding that it was barred by the combined operation of sections 236 and 208 of the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 2 (FPSLRA). Together, these provisions bar any civil recourse for \u201cany dispute relating to\u2026 terms or conditions of employment\u201d which can be addressed through a grievance procedure.\n[2] I would dismiss the appeal. The Federal Court correctly understood and applied paragraph 208(1)(b) and section 236 of the FPSLRA, and did not err in refusing to exercise its residual discretion to allow the claim to proceed.\nThe Federal Court decision\n[3] The appellant, a Canadian citizen and practicing Muslim, has been employed with CSIS since 2000 in the Prairie Regional office in Edmonton. He has been on sick leave since January of 2018 because of an alleged pattern of discrimination, humiliation, harassment and psychological abuse in the workplace. He commenced an action in the Federal Court against CSIS alleging the intentional torts of mental suffering, assault and battery, as well as breaches of his Charter rights under sections 2, 7, and 15. The appellant sought damages in tort and under subsection 24(1) of the Charter.\n[4] Applying the \u201cplain and obvious\u201d test from R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45 (Federal Court decision at paras. 26-29), the Federal Court granted the respondents\u2019 motion to strike the claim. After examining the allegations in the claim in light of the jurisprudence, the Federal Court held that section 236 of the FPSLRA barred all of the appellant\u2019s claims.\n[5] The Federal Court judge acknowledged that the bar in section 236 of the FPSLRA only applies to disputes that may be grieved under section 208 of the FPSLRA. However, the judge found that the appellant\u2019s allegations relating to threats, harassment, and discrimination could be grieved under paragraph 208(1)(b) of the FPSLRA, noting that prior case law had applied this provision to a wide range of workplace-related disputes, including allegations of discrimination and harassment (Federal Court decision at paras. 38-41). Also, in the Federal Court\u2019s view, the fact that the appellant requested Charter remedies (Federal Court decision at paras. 43-44) did not place the claims outside the scope of section 208. These conclusions were described as the \u201ccomplete answer to his submissions\u201d (Federal Court decision at para. 48).\n[6] In reaching his decision the judge noted that the harassment allegations fell within the scope of the CSIS Safe, Healthy and Respectful Workplace Policy, as well as the corresponding CSIS policy dealing with the resolution of harassment complaints (collectively, the Harassment Policy). While article 5.19 of the Harassment Policy precluded a grievance in respect of a harassment investigators\u2019 report, the judge noted that this only precluded grievances in respect of the conclusions of an investigator in a harassment claim; a complainant would still be able to grieve the manner in which the investigation was conducted, management\u2019s decision to accept or reject the investigator\u2019s report and management\u2019s decision with respect to a remedy (Federal Court decision at para. 58).\n[7] Finally, the Federal Court held that the circumstances of the case did not warrant the exercise of any residual discretion that the Court might retain in light of the statutory scheme. In this regard, the Court noted that the appellant had never filed a complaint under the Harassment Policy in the course of his 20-year career at CSIS nor had he engaged the CSIS grievance procedure (Federal Court decision at para. 47). The Federal Court also did not find the appellant\u2019s evidence in support of the assertion that the harassment and grievance procedures at CSIS were \u201cfutile\u201d or \u201cbroken\u201d to be convincing (Federal Court decision at para. 61).\nThe appellant\u2019s case\n[8] The core of the appellant\u2019s appeal is that the Federal Court erred in concluding that the Charter breaches and intentional torts alleged by the appellant were grievable under paragraph 208(1)(b) of the FPSLRA, as this brings too broad an interpretation to the language of \u201cterms and conditions of employment\u201d. He argues that employees do not forgo civil remedies they might have against their employer in respect of intentional torts. In this regard, the appellant emphasizes that he could not have grieved his claims of harassment, given the existence of article 5.19 of CSIS\u2019s Harassment Policy, which channels harassment complaints away from the grievance procedure.\n[9] His second ground of appeal is that the Federal Court erred in declining to exercise its residual discretion to hear the appellant\u2019s action. The appellant emphasizes that the judge overlooked key facts that were relevant to the exercise of residual discretion. Those included that the appellant does not belong to a union, that the remedies sought are not available through existing CSIS procedures, that CSIS\u2019s harassment procedures provide limited procedural rights and avenues of review and that there was systemic discrimination, harassment, and a fear of reprisal for complaints within CSIS.\n[10] The appellant also raises a new argument before this Court. He challenges the constitutional validity of section 236 of the FPSLRA, arguing that section 236 of the FPSLRA is unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibits a court from hearing claims under the Charter.\n[11] I will deal briefly with this argument now.\n[12] The appellant did not raise this issue at first instance, and did not serve a notice of constitutional question in accordance with section 57 of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-7 until one month after the respondents raised the issue in their submissions.\n[13] The decision whether to hear a constitutional challenge for the first time on appeal is discretionary, albeit one governed by specific considerations including the state of the record, fairness to all parties, the importance of having the issue resolved, the issue\u2019s suitability for decision, and more broadly, the fair and efficient administration of justice. The burden is on the challenging party to show that hearing the issue would be appropriate and non-prejudicial (Guindon v. Canada, 2015 SCC 41, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 3 at para. 23).\n[14] The test is strict, and, as a general premise, courts are hesitant to address the constitutional validity of a provision without a sufficient factual context (Smith v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 122, 2023 A.C.W.S. 2306 at para. 52; Filion v. Canada., 2017 FCA 67, 77 A.C.W.S. (3d) 211 at para. 14). A constitutional challenge raised for the first time on appeal may rest on an inadequate and potentially prejudicial evidentiary foundation and the appellate court is deprived of a trial judge\u2019s reasoning and analysis (Luk\u00e1cs v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 FCA 36, 2023 A.C.W.S. 639 at paras. 73-74).\n[15] I would not exercise my discretion to hear the constitutional argument raised by the appellant. The arguments were not developed before us in either memorandum and the Court does not have the benefit of the Federal Court\u2019s consideration of the issues. It would be premature for us to offer an opinion on the constitutionality of an important statutory provision in these circumstances.\n[16] I return to the substance of this appeal and note that the appellate standards from Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, i.e. correctness for questions of law, and palpable and overriding error for questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law, apply. There are extricable questions of law raised by this appeal: whether the appellant\u2019s claims of Charter breaches and intentional torts could have been grieved under paragraph 208(1)(b) of the FPSLRA, and whether, even if the appellant\u2019s claims could have been so grieved, the Federal Court has a residual discretion to hear the matter in light of the grievance scheme. Assuming that it did have this discretion, the question of whether the judge erred in the exercise of that discretion is assessed against a standard of palpable and overriding error.\nThe statutory scheme\n[17] I begin with the central issue on this appeal\u2014whether the judge erred in finding that the appellant could have grieved his allegations of intentional torts and Charter breaches under paragraph 208(1)(b) of the FPSLRA. Sections 208 and 236 are set forth in their entirety in the appendix at the end of these reasons. I have however extracted the two key provisions in issue in this appeal:\n208(1) Subject to subsections (2) to (7), an employee is entitled to present an individual grievance if he or she feels aggrieved\n(a) by the interpretation or application, in respect of the employee, of\n(i) a provision of a statute or regulation, or of a direction or other instrument made or issued by the employer, that deals with terms and conditions of employment, or\n(ii) a provision of a collective agreement or an arbitral award; or\n(b) as a result of any occurrence or matter affecting his or her terms and conditions of employment.\n208 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (2) \u00e0 (7), le fonctionnaire a le droit de pr\u00e9senter un grief individuel lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019estime l\u00e9s\u00e9 :\na) par l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ou l\u2019application \u00e0 son \u00e9gard :\n(i) soit de toute disposition d\u2019une loi ou d\u2019un r\u00e8glement, ou de toute directive ou de tout autre document de l\u2019employeur concernant les conditions d\u2019emploi,\n(ii) soit de toute disposition d\u2019une convention collective ou d\u2019une d\u00e9cision arbitrale;\nb) par suite de tout fait portant atteinte \u00e0 ses conditions d\u2019emploi.\n236(1) The right of an employee to seek redress by way of grievance for any dispute relating to his or her terms or conditions of employment is in lieu of any right of action that the employee may have in relation to any act or omission giving rise to the dispute.\n(2) Subsection (1) applies whether or not the employee avails himself or herself of the right to present a grievance in any particular case and whether or not the grievance could be referred to adjudication.\n236 (1) Le droit de recours du fonctionnaire par voie de grief relativement \u00e0 tout diff\u00e9rend li\u00e9 \u00e0 ses conditions d\u2019emploi remplace ses droits d\u2019action en justice relativement aux faits \u2014 actions ou omissions \u2014 \u00e0 l\u2019origine du diff\u00e9rend.\n(2) Le paragraphe (1) s\u2019applique que le fonctionnaire se pr\u00e9vale ou non de son droit de pr\u00e9senter un grief et qu\u2019il soit possible ou non de soumettre le grief \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage.\n[18] It is instructive to begin with the decisions of the Supreme Court in Weber v. Ontario Hydro, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 929, 1995 CanLII 108 [Weber] and Vaughan v. Canada, 2005 SCC 11, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 146 [Vaughan]. These decisions provide critical guidance in considering the issues raised by this appeal.\n[19] In Weber the employer sent a private investigator to the employee\u2019s home to investigate the employee\u2019s entitlement to the sick leave benefits he had been claiming. The investigator entered the employee\u2019s home under false pretenses. The employee filed grievances against his employer and concurrently brought an action in the provincial court based on various torts and breaches of the Charter. The Supreme Court held that the employee\u2019s action was barred by subsection 45(1) of Ontario\u2019s Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.2, which provided that all collective agreements \u201cshall provide for the final and binding settlement by arbitration\u2026 of all differences between the parties arising from the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the agreement\u201d.\n[20] The Court held that the arbitrator was to have exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes arising out of the collective agreement. The Court rejected that there could be overlapping jurisdiction between courts and labour arbitrators where issues extended to the common law, the Charter, or matters outside of the traditional subject matter of labour law. This approach would undercut not only the clear statutory language at issue, but the purpose of the exclusive arbitration regime that is \u201cat the heart of all Canadian labour statutes\u201d, which provides for quick, economic resolution of claims (Weber at paras. 39-50).\n[21] In determining whether a dispute arises out of a collective agreement, the Court held that decision-makers must look to the \u201cessential character\u201d of the dispute. This involves assessing the facts of the dispute. The place at which the dispute arose and the parties to the dispute may be relevant, but are not determinative (Weber at paras. 43 and 51-52).\n[22] Importantly, for the purposes of the issues before us, the Supreme Court was clear that it is the facts that govern, and not the legal characterization that counsel give to those facts. This has implications for the appellant\u2019s argument that intentional torts can never have a connection to the workplace, as it can never be within the terms and conditions of employment that an employee foregoes a right to sue for compensation for an intentional tort in the workplace. Weber teaches that the inquiry must remain focused on the facts that gave rise to the dispute.\n[23] The Supreme Court also confirmed the ability of labour adjudicators to consider torts and Charter breaches, as well as to award Charter remedies (paras. 55-56 and 66). While arbitrators may not have the same expertise as courts, they are still subject to judicial review. If there is a remedy required that an arbitrator cannot grant, courts of inherent jurisdiction can take jurisdiction\u2014though there must be a \u201creal deprivation of the ultimate remedy\u201d sought (Weber at para. 57).\n[24] The dispute in Weber was, in fact, related to the employee\u2019s collective agreement. The Court acknowledged that \u201c[i]solated from the collective agreement, the conduct complained of in this case might well be argued to fall outside the normal scope of employer-employee relations\u201d (Weber at para. 71). However, the collective agreement provided that the grievance procedure applied to \u201c[a]ny allegation that an employee has been subjected to unfair treatment or any dispute arising out of the content of this Agreement\u201d (Weber at para. 72).\n[25] A decade after Weber came Vaughan. In Vaughan, the employee, a federal public servant, was denied early retirement benefits. The denial was grievable, but not arbitrable. The employee did not grieve the denial of benefits, but instead brought an action in the Federal Court based in negligence, alleging that his employer ought to have known that he was eligible for the benefits. The employee argued that Weber was distinguishable since there was no independent third-party adjudication available to him. (I add, parenthetically, that the appellant in this appeal also has no recourse to adjudication.)\n[26] The Supreme Court held that the employee\u2019s action was barred by what are now sections 208 and 209 of the FPSLRA. While these provisions did not explicitly oust the court\u2019s jurisdiction, the comprehensive nature of the scheme and the rationale behind it signalled that courts should defer to grievance processes. The lack of third-party adjudication did not, in and of itself, allow a court to exercise its residual discretion to hear a claim. Courts exercise their residual discretion, for example, in circumstances where a whistle-blowing claim is brought or where the integrity of the grievance process or the effectiveness of available remedies is called into question. However, courts should generally decline to get involved in such disputes, except via judicial review (Vaughan at paras. 13, 16-17, 22, and 39).\n[27] The Court, echoing Weber, noted that permitting parallel access to the courts would jeopardize the comprehensive scheme for labour disputes meant to provide specialized, expedient resolutions. The Court also cautioned litigants against \u201cdressing [] up\u201d grievable disputes as negligence actions, guidance which is particularly apposite to this appeal (Vaughan at paras. 37, 40, and 42).\n[28] Following Vaughan, Parliament added section 236 to the FPSLRA, which provides that the court\u2019s jurisdiction is ousted by grievance processes even where there is no third-party adjudication. The Ontario Court of Appeal in Bron v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 ONCA 71, [2010] O.J. No. 340 [Bron] noted that this effectively patched the \u201cwhistle-blower exception\u201d coming out of Vaughan, leaving courts with residual discretion to hear grievable claims only where the grievance process cannot provide an appropriate remedy (Bron at paras. 27-30).\n[29] Since Weber and Vaughan, conflicts related to the \u201cterms and conditions of employment\u201d referred to in paragraph 208(1)(b) of the FPSLRA have been considered to encompass allegations of defamation, discrimination, harassment, malice and bad faith, Charter breaches, and intentional torts, including intentional infliction of mental suffering (see, for example: Nosistel v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FC 618, [2018] CarswellNat 10225 (WL Can) at para. 66; Price v. Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 649, 268 A.C.W.S. (3d) 866 at paras. 26-31; Green v. Canada (Border Services Agency), 2018 FC 414, 291 A.C.W.S. (3d) 402 at para. 16; Bron at paras. 14-15; Thompson v. Kolotinsky, 2023 ONSC 1588 (Div. Ct.), 2023 A.C.W.S. 2518 at paras. 37-39).\n[30] In Hudson v. Canada, 2022 FC 694, 2022 C.L.L.C. 220-053 [Hudson] the Federal Court held that allegations of sexual assault in the workplace were grievable. The Court noted that given the breadth of section 208, the plaintiffs could not escape the operation of section 236 of the FPSLRA simply by alleging that their claims were not \u201cordinary workplace disputes\u201d. The Federal Court pointed to Jane Doe v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 183, 428 D.L.R. (4th) 374, in which this Court found that an adjudicating board had unreasonably denied compensation for pain and suffering to an employee who had been subject to a sexual assault by her co-worker\u2014demonstrating that sexual assault claims have been, at least implicitly, recognized as grievable (Hudson at paras. 102-103).\n[31] Two cases are helpful in fleshing out the contours of the required nexus to the workplace\/employment.\n[32] In Martell v. AG of Canada & Ors., 2016 PECA 8, 376 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 91 [Martell], the claimant brought an action against her employer alleging harassment and a hostile work environment, as well as harassment by individual defendants that occurred after her resignation. The Court held that the claims covering occurrences during her employment were grievable, as they arose in the workplace, during the course of her employment and by perpetrators in the performance of their duties (Martell at paras. 11-13). The claims that arose post-resignation, though, were not grievable, as \u201c[c]laims of abuse, threats, and harassment which occurred long after the employment relationship ended cannot be considered matters in which the essential character of the dispute is rooted in the appellant\u2019s term of employment\u201d (Martell at para. 37).\n[33] Similarly, in Joseph v. Canada School of Public Service et al., 2022 ONSC 6734, 2022 CarswellOnt 17461 [Joseph], the claimant was terminated following a security investigation at her workplace, during which her employer involved the police. The claimant alleged the torts of breach of privacy, negligence, and defamation. The Court held that the portions of the claim dealing with the employer\u2019s involving of the police and the consequent alleged breaches of privacy were not grievable, since their essential character did not relate to the employee\u2019s collective agreement, but rather to \u201cpotential resort to the criminal process\u201d (Joseph at para. 29). The balance of the claims (negligence and defamation, in association with the suspensions and investigation) were grievable, as they related to the managerial duties of discipline (Joseph at para. 31).\n[34] The appellant contends that the words \u201caffecting\u2026 terms and conditions of employment\u201d must be given a more restrictive meaning than that accorded to them by the Federal Court, or indeed, by much of the jurisprudence. I do not agree.\n[35] Each word in a statute must be given meaning; it is presumed that the legislature does not speak in vain. Courts should therefore \u201cavoid, as much as possible, adopting interpretations that would render any portion of a statute meaningless\u201d (Ruth Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes, 7th ed. (Toronto, ON: LexisNexis Canada, 2022) at \u00a78.03). Every word has a specific role to play in advancing the legislative purpose, and in this case the word \u201caffecting\u201d is integral to understanding the meaning of the section. Parliament chose a word with a broad sweep; it did not say \u201cin the terms and conditions of employment\u201d. As observed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Bron at paragraph 15, \u201c[a]lmost all employment-related disputes can be grieved under s[ection] 208\u201d.\n[36] This interpretation aligns with the object of the FPSLRA, which was to establish a comprehensive and exclusive scheme for the resolution of labour disputes (Vaughan at para. 39). To allow large categories of claims\u2014such as any claim involving an intentional tort or Charter breach\u2014to escape the operation of the FPSLRA would undermine Parliament\u2019s intent. Many if not all workplace grievances could, through artful pleading, be cast as intentional torts: for example, a manager speaking harshly to an employee could be said to be intentionally inflicting mental harm, or the failure to be promoted an act of discrimination. To exempt these claims from the grievance process could effectively gut the scheme, reducing it to the most mechanical and administrative elements of employment relationships, such as hours of work, overtime, classification and pay.\n[37] The application of section 208 cannot be driven by the label that a party assigns to the behaviour or conduct. This would divert from the true inquiry, which is the degree of connectedness between the complaint and the workplace. Here, the essential character of the appellant\u2019s allegations is that CSIS failed to provide the appellant that which it committed to provide by its policies\u2014a safe and harassment-free workplace. A safe and harassment-free workplace, manifested by managerial practices and co-worker behaviour, must at the very least be impliedly part of any employee\u2019s terms and conditions.\nWhether CSIS policy bars grievance\n[38] The appellant argues that, in any event, he could not grieve the allegations in the statement of claim in light of article 5.19 of the Harassment Policy and thus the grievance process could not provide him with an effective remedy:\n5.19: The investigator\u2019s conclusion(s) cannot be subject to a grievance.\n[39] The Federal Court held that while the appellant could not have grieved the conclusions of an investigator, other key elements of a harassment claim could be grieved, including the manner in which an investigation was conducted, management\u2019s decision to accept or reject the investigator\u2019s report and any decision with respect to remedy or discipline (Federal Court decision at para. 58).\n[40] I agree with the Federal Court that the harassment investigation process, and what management did with the report, including any remedy, could have been grieved; but I would go further. While inelegantly framed, article 5.19 does not constitute a dead-end for the employee; rather it simply means that the report itself does not trigger a new, independent grievance, separate and apart from the conduct that sparked the filing of the harassment complaint. Article 5.19 confirms that the investigation report itself is a preliminary step, with no direct consequence unless and until accepted by management. The effect of article 5.19 is to ensure that the harassment inquiry is not diverted from the true focus\u2014the conduct in question. Management\u2019s decision to accept or reject the report is therefore grievable. It is then that the substantive right to grieve arises; acceptance of the report makes it a management decision.\n[41] This result accords with Kane J.\u2019s holding in Thomas v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 FC 292, 430 F.T.R. 1 [Thomas]. There, the Court held that there was no procedural unfairness in a harassment complainant not being provided with a copy of the investigator\u2019s final report for comment prior to its submission to the responsible manager. The Court pointed out that such an approach would be inefficient and contrary to the set-up of the scheme: the investigation itself is delegated, with the manager making the ultimate decision based on the final report of the investigator (Thomas at para. 89). While Thomas dealt with a different workplace and therefore a different investigatory scheme, the case stands for the proposition that the ultimate conclusion of a manager, though based on an investigation, is purposefully separate from the conclusion of the investigator. This reasoning, when applied to the CSIS Harassment Policy, leaves the conduct complained of grievable.\n[42] In addition, subsection 208(5) of the FPSLRA does not assist the appellant. Subsection 208(5) provides that \u201c[a]n employee who, in respect of any matter, avails himself or herself of a complaint procedure established by a policy of the employer may not present an individual grievance in respect of that matter if the policy expressly provides that an employee who avails himself or herself of the complaint procedure is precluded from presenting an individual grievance under this Act\u201d.\n[43] For the provision to apply, two conditions must be met: the employee must avail himself or herself of a complaint procedure established by a policy of the employer, and that policy must expressly provide that the employee is precluded from grieving the matter.\n[44] As explained below, the appellant did not avail himself of the complaint procedure under the Harassment Policy. In any event, as I have concluded, article 5.19 of the Harassment Policy does not preclude an employee from presenting an individual grievance under the FPSLRA. Subsection 208(5) does not affect the appellant\u2019s right to grieve.\n[45] I would therefore dismiss this argument.\nWhether the Court should have exercised its residual discretion\n[46] The Federal Court did not err in declining to exercise its residual discretion to hear the appellant\u2019s action.\n[47] In Canada v. Greenwood, 2021 FCA 186, [2021] 4 F.C.R. 635, this Court confirmed the existence of a residual discretion but confined its exercise to circumstances where \u201cthe internal mechanisms are incapable of providing effective redress\u201d (at para. 130). Similarly, the New Brunswick Court of Appeal has confined the discretion to circumstances where the grievance process itself is entirely \u201ccorrupt\u201d (Attorney General of Canada, on behalf of Correctional Service of Canada v. Robichaud and MacKinnon, 2013 NBCA 3, 398 N.B.R. (2d) 259 at para. 10). Therefore, the Court\u2019s residual discretion arises where the available mechanisms cannot provide effective redress, either because the legislative scheme does not cover the circumstances, or because the existing processes are demonstrably ineffective (see, for example, Weber at para. 67; Bron at para. 29).\n[48] The Federal Court determined, and I agree, that the interpretation or application of CSIS policies, including the Harassment Policy, could be grieved under subparagraph 208(1)(a)(i) (Federal Court decision at paras. 48-49). I agree that this would encompass various claims of the appellant, with the broader paragraph 208(1)(b) capturing the balance of his claims. There is no legislative gap.\n[49] The Federal Court also found that the evidence put forward by the appellant did not support the conclusion that the CSIS grievance process was \u201cbroken\u201d or \u201cfutile\u201d or \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d (Federal Court decision at para. 61). The Federal Court considered both a statement of the Director of CSIS as to the existence of systemic racism and the assertion in an expert report of a culture of fear of reprisal. The Federal Court was not persuaded by this evidence and gave thoughtful reasons in support of its conclusion. I see no reviewable error in its assessment of this evidence.\n[50] I turn to the argument that the judge erred in finding that a harassment complaint had not been filed, and that this coloured his approach to the exercise of his discretion.\n[51] The appellant alleges that he filed a harassment complaint pursuant to the Harassment Policy, but that it was ignored. To this end, he points to two emails he sent to management in 2017 as constituting his filing of a complaint. He says that they are sufficient to put management on notice of his concerns and that the Federal Court judge erred in concluding that the Harassment Policy had not been invoked.\n[52] In the first email the appellant alleged that he was disturbed during prayer by a co-worker, causing stress and anxiety. The appellant stated that he \u201cneed[s]\u2026 help\u201d as he did not know what would be \u201cthe next plot to harm [him]\u201d (Appeal Book at p. 109). This email resulted in the appellant\u2019s manager meeting with one of the appellant\u2019s alleged harassers to hear her side of the story and to set certain behavioural boundaries with her. The appellant emailed his manager approximately one week later, alleging that his co-workers continued to bother him by \u201cwalking back and forth in front of [his] office and trying to take a peek into [his] office\u201d (Appeal Book at p. 121). The appellant\u2019s manager acknowledged his email and stated that further action would be taken. It does not appear that there was any further follow-up by either party.\n[53] The appellant also relies on an email sent to management in 2013 in which he alleges an unreasonable workload and mistreatment at work, including subjection to \u201chumiliation, abuse and harassment\u201d (Appeal Book at p. 152). This email resulted in some action by management, including supervision of the appellant, referral to health supports, other employee support programs and to CSIS\u2019s Internal Conflict Management Service.\n[54] I am not convinced that the judge made a palpable and overriding error in his conclusion that a harassment complaint had not been filed. The judge considered this evidence and concluded that a complaint had not been filed. His decision has an evidentiary foundation. The judge noted that the appellant never engaged the formal Harassment Policy procedures, never asked that his emails be treated as a harassment complaint and never followed up on them, as one would reasonably expect. The appellant also reluctantly conceded under cross-examination that while he was aware of CSIS\u2019s Harassment Policy as early as 2008 or 2009, he never filed a formal complaint (Appeal Book at pp. 814-816 and 820).\n[55] The filing of a harassment complaint has consequences for the organization and certainly for the person alleged to have breached departmental standards of conduct. Complaints, whether memorialized or not, about disputes or misbehaviour are insufficient to inferentially trigger the policy. There must be sufficient precision in the complaint, identifying when, whom and what conduct or behaviour, and, importantly, a clear stated intention on the part of the employee to commence a harassment complaint in order for management to begin an investigation.\n[56] Finally, the appellant contends that the lack of civil damages and Charter remedies available warrants a favourable exercise of discretion to allow his action to proceed to trial.\n[57] I do not agree.\n[58] At no time during his twenty-year career did the appellant file a complaint under the Harassment Policy or the grievance procedure. As Brown J. rightly concluded, \u201c[h]e cannot now litigate in this Court the adequacy of procedures he himself chose never to follow\u201d (Federal Court decision at para. 47). This is consistent with what Binnie J. noted in Vaughan: courts should generally decline to exercise their jurisdiction where the claimant\u2019s legal position would be improved by a failure to engage with available grievance procedures. To allow the appellant to come to the courts without having used the workplace harassment procedures available would undermine efficient labour relations, as it would put the courts in competition with existing labour schemes, clogging up a system designed to streamline dispute resolution (Vaughan at para. 37). I note again that a lack of third-party adjudication does not itself make a scheme less worthy of deference, and does not itself allow a court to exercise its residual discretion (Vaughan at para. 38).\n[59] Further, the absence of remedies argument was based on the assumption that article 5.19 of the Harassment Policy precluded access to grievance procedures. This assumption is, for the reasons I have explained, incorrect. The conduct in issue can be grieved and the final level grievance decision is subject to judicial review.\n[60] Nor did this Court hear argument on the scope of remedies available to the appellant should his grievance be successful. We did not hear, for example, of any possibility of compensation under the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. G-5 (GECA). The Federal Court has cited the GECA as a possible source of compensation in lieu of an action for workplace injuries\u2014including injuries to mental health (Hudson at para. 61). Additionally, remedial schemes like the GECA are to be interpreted so as to achieve coherence with related legislation, which would include the FPSLRA (R. v. Ulybel Enterprises Ltd., 2001 SCC 56, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 867 at paras. 50-52; see also L\u00e9vis (City) v. Fraternit\u00e9 des policiers de L\u00e9vis Inc., 2007 SCC 14, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 591 at para. 47). I, of course, make no decision whether the GECA would actually allow the appellant to claim compensation under the circumstances.\n[61] Accordingly, I would sustain the judge\u2019s decision not to exercise his discretion to allow the action to proceed.\n[62] I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\u201cDonald J. Rennie\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nMonica Biringer J.A.\u201d\nWEBB J.A. (Dissenting Reasons)\n[63] I have read my colleagues\u2019 reasons. I would, however, reach a different conclusion with respect to whether the appellant\u2019s statement of claim should be struck in its entirety.\n[64] The appellant filed a statement of claim in the Federal Court. The alleged incidents are summarized in paragraph 11 of the reasons of the Federal Court Judge. In particular, the appellant alleges that:\nJ. He was subjected to insults and assaults from his co-workers while he was praying in his office between 2015 and 2018.\n[65] In paragraph 27 of his statement of claim, the appellant expanded upon the alleged incidents that occurred while he was praying:\n27. Worse still, Jane, Joseph, and others, would enter Sameer\u2019s office by quickly swinging open the door, knowing he was at prayer and located just behind the door, and smash the door into Sameer\u2019s body or head. They would then feign surprise that Sameer was at prayer, but would laugh outside the door afterwards. Jane and Joseph were the individual defendants who took the most pleasure in this \u201cpastime\u201d and did this to Sameer on several occasions between 2015 and 2017, sometimes as often as weekly. Jane also would invite other employees to the attraction for mockery and amusement.\n[66] A further incident is described in paragraph 31 of his statement of claim:\n31. In late January 2018, Sameer returned from a lunch break to discover that someone had obviously spit on his office door while he was away.\n[67] These incidents can generally be characterized as harassment complaints. The alleged causes of action are intentional infliction of mental suffering; assault and battery; and breaches of the appellant\u2019s rights under sections 2, 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982 being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c 11 (Charter).\n[68] The appellant also describes, in his statement of claim, certain interactions with management when he attempted to raise his concerns about harassment and discrimination.\n[69] The motion before the Federal Court was a motion to strike the appellant\u2019s statement of claim. The test for striking a pleading is set out in R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42:\n[17] \u2026 A claim will only be struck if it is plain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action: Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse, 2003 SCC 69, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263, at para. 15; Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959, at p. 980. Another way of putting the test is that the claim has no reasonable prospect of success. Where a reasonable prospect of success exists, the matter should be allowed to proceed to trial: see, generally, Syl Apps Secure Treatment Centre v. B.D., 2007 SCC 38, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 83; Odhavji Estate; Hunt; Attorney General of Canada v. Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 735.\n[70] The key provision in this appeal is subsection 236(1) of the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22 (FPSLRA), which bars an employee from bringing an action with respect to a particular dispute when that employee has a grievance right in relation to the same dispute. In my view, it is important to focus on the specific wording of this provision:\n236 (1) The right of an employee to seek redress by way of grievance for any dispute relating to his or her terms or conditions of employment is in lieu of any right of action that the employee may have in relation to any act or omission giving rise to the dispute.\n236 (1) Le droit de recours du fonctionnaire par voie de grief relativement \u00e0 tout diff\u00e9rend li\u00e9 \u00e0 ses conditions d\u2019emploi remplace ses droits d\u2019action en justice relativement aux faits \u2014 actions ou omissions \u2014 \u00e0 l\u2019origine du diff\u00e9rend.\n[71] This subsection bars \u201cany right of action that the employee may have in relation to any act or omission giving rise to the dispute\u201d. The basis for this bar is that this right of action is replaced by \u201c[t]he right of an employee to seek redress by way of grievance for any dispute relating to his or her terms or conditions of employment\u201d.\n[72] The acts that give rise to the dispute in this case are the acts of certain employees of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). These acts form the basis of the action commenced by the appellant. The reference to \u201cany right of action that the employee may have in relation to any act or omission giving rise to the dispute\u201d (emphasis added) in subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA limits the statutory bar to causes of action that are related to the same acts or omissions for which an employee may seek redress by way of grievance.\n[73] This link between the statutory bar and the right to grieve the same matter is identified by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Bron v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 ONCA 71. In Bron the Ontario Court of Appeal addressed the bar in subsection 236(1) of the Public Service Labour Relations Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 2 (the PSLRA which is now the FPSLRA):\n[29] Parliament can, subject to constitutional limitations that are not raised here, confer exclusive jurisdiction to determine certain disputes on a forum other than the courts. It will take clear language to achieve that result: Pleau [Pleau (Litigation Guardian of) v. Canada (Attorney General), 1999 NSCA 159, 182 D.L.R. (4th) 373, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 27770 (28 September 2000)] at p. 381 [D.L.R.]. Section 236 is clear and unequivocal. Subject to the exception identified in s. 236(3), which has no application here, s. 236(1) declares that the right granted under the legislation to grieve any work related dispute is \u201cin lieu of any right of action\u201d that the employee may have in respect of the same matter. Section 236(2) expressly declares that the exclusivity of the grievance process identified in s. 236(1) operates whether or not the employee actually presents a grievance and \u201cwhether or not the grievance could be referred to adjudication\u201d. The result of the language used in s. 236(1) and (2) is that a court no longer has any residual discretion to entertain a claim that is otherwise grievable under the legislation on the basis of an employee's inability to access third-party adjudication: see Van Duyvenbode v. Canada (Attorney General), [2007] O.J. No. 2716 (S.C.), at para. 17, aff\u2019d without reference to this point, 2009 ONCA 11; Hagal v. Canada (Attorney General), [2009] F.C.J. No. 417, [2009 FC 329] (T.D.), at para. 26, aff\u2019d without reference to this point 2009 FCA 364.\n[emphasis added]\n[74] The Ontario Court of Appeal noted that the bar to bringing an action in relation to a particular dispute applies when an employee has a grievance right with respect to the same matter.\n[75] In Pearce v. Canada (Staff of the Non-Public Funds, Canadian Forces), 2021 ONCA 65, the Ontario Court of Appeal identified the purpose of the FPSLRA:\n[69]The purpose of the FPSLRA is to ensure that the \u201cGovernment of Canada is committed to the fair, credible and efficient resolution of matters arising in respect of terms and conditions of employment.\u201d\n[76] The purpose of having a fair and credible resolution of workplace disputes would be satisfied if an aggrieved employee has a forum in which a particular dispute may be resolved.\n[77] In Vaughan v. Canada, 2005 SCC 11, at paragraph 22, the Supreme Court of Canada stated:\nThe task of the court is still to determine whether, looking at the legislative scheme as a whole, Parliament intended workplace disputes to be decided by the courts or under the grievance procedure established by the PSSRA [Public Service Staff Relations Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-35, which was replaced by the PSLRA and later the FPSLRA].\n[78] Since the Supreme Court only identified two possibilities \u2015 a court procedure or a grievance procedure \u2015 if a grievance procedure is not available then it would fall to the Courts to resolve the dispute. This leads to the question of whether redress by way of grievance is available to the appellant for the same matter that is the subject of the statement of claim.\n[79] Subsection 208(1) of the FPSLRA provides a general right of grievance:\n208 (1) Subject to subsections (2) to (7), an employee is entitled to present an individual grievance if he or she feels aggrieved\n208 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (2) \u00e0 (7), le fonctionnaire a le droit de pr\u00e9senter un grief individuel lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019estime l\u00e9s\u00e9 :\n(a) by the interpretation or application, in respect of the employee, of\na) par l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ou l\u2019application \u00e0 son \u00e9gard :\n(i) a provision of a statute or regulation, or of a direction or other instrument made or issued by the employer, that deals with terms and conditions of employment, or\n(i) soit de toute disposition d\u2019une loi ou d\u2019un r\u00e8glement, ou de toute directive ou de tout autre document de l\u2019employeur concernant les conditions d\u2019emploi,\n(ii) a provision of a collective agreement or an arbitral award; or\n(ii) soit de toute disposition d\u2019une convention collective ou d\u2019une d\u00e9cision arbitrale;\n(b) as a result of any occurrence or matter affecting his or her terms and conditions of employment.\nb) par suite de tout fait portant atteinte \u00e0 ses conditions d\u2019emploi.\n[80] Subsection 208(5) provides that an employee is precluded from presenting a grievance if the employee \u201cavails himself or herself of a complaint procedure established by a policy of the employer\u201d and the applicable policy precludes presenting a grievance:\n(5) An employee who, in respect of any matter, avails himself or herself of a complaint procedure established by a policy of the employer may not present an individual grievance in respect of that matter if the policy expressly provides that an employee who avails himself or herself of the complaint procedure is precluded from presenting an individual grievance under this Act.\n(5) Le fonctionnaire qui choisit, pour une question donn\u00e9e, de se pr\u00e9valoir de la proc\u00e9dure de plainte institu\u00e9e par une ligne directrice de l\u2019employeur ne peut pr\u00e9senter de grief individuel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette question sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi si la ligne directrice pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment cette impossibilit\u00e9.\n[81] Since this provision is conditional on an employee availing himself or herself of a separate complaint procedure, rather than being conditional on such a separate complaint procedure being available, it could raise the question of whether an employee would have the option to choose whether to follow the complaint procedure or present a grievance.\n[82] In this matter, the appellant did not avail himself of \u201cCSIS Procedures: Resolution of Harassment Complaints\u201d (the Harassment Policy). Neither the Federal Court nor the respondent have suggested that since the appellant did not avail himself of the Harassment Policy he would have been able to present a grievance with respect to his complaint of harassment. If he would have attempted to present a grievance with respect to his complaint of harassment, it would appear that article 1.2.2 e) of the Human Resources Policies and Procedures HUM-502 Grievance Resolution (Grievance Policy) and article 5.2 of the Harassment Policy would have been applied and his complaint would have proceeded under the Harassment Policy:\nGrievance Policy\n1.2.2 This policy is not applicable in cases where alternative recourse, through the following policies and procedures, is available:\n\u2026\ne) Resolution of complaints of harassment - refer to \u201cCSIS Procedures \u2013 Resolution of Harassment Complaints\u201d\nHarassment Policy\n5.2 Should an employee file a grievance in which allegations of harassment are raised, the file is first addressed as a harassment complaint. A grievance and a harassment complaint cannot run concurrently for the same situation. If a complaint on the same issue is or has been dealt with through the grievance process, the formal complaint of harassment will not proceed any further and the file will be closed.\n[83] Under the Harassment Policy, if a complaint is found to be admissible (article 5.10), an investigator is appointed by the Assistant Director, Human Resources (ADH) (article 5.12). The Investigation Process is set out in articles 5.15 to 5.19:\n5.15 The ADH must provide the investigator with the Terms of Reference which outline how to proceed with the investigation.\n5.16 A complaint should be investigated and completed within six months. Should there be a requirement to go beyond the six month period, the complainant and respondent must be advised as to the reasons why an extension is required.\n5.17 When the investigation is complete, the investigator must present a final report to the ADH. This report details the allegations, issues and facts provided by the parties and witnesses during the course of the interviews, as well as an analysis and conclusion on whether the allegations of harassment were founded or unfounded.\n5.18 The ADH must review the final report provided by the investigator and make the decision to accept or not to accept the investigator\u2019s conclusion(s). The ADH decision and the findings must be provided to the complainant and the respondent. Where corrective or disciplinary measures may be required, the respondent will be given ten working days to provide comments before a decision is made on the appropriate disciplinary measure. The employee\u2019s DG [Director General], or where applicable the AD [Assistant Director] or DD [Deputy Director] will receive a copy of the final report and determine the measures in consultation with LR [Labour Relations]. Complainants must be notified of any disciplinary measure to be imposed.\n5.19 The investigator\u2019s conclusion(s) cannot be subject to a grievance.\n[emphasis added]\n[84] Under the Harassment Policy, the investigator\u2019s conclusion cannot be the subject of a grievance (article 5.19). This conclusion is the finding that the allegations of harassment were either founded or unfounded (article 5.17). Therefore, there is no right to grieve an investigator\u2019s finding that an allegation of harassment is unfounded.\n[85] The Federal Court found that the appellant would have some grievance rights:\n[57] In addition, as the AGC notes, it is only the investigator's conclusion(s) under the Harassment Policy that may not be subject to a grievance, by virtue of the article 5.19 of the Harassment Policy quoted above. AGC submits and I find that under the Harassment Policy it is up to CSIS management to accept or reject the investigator's conclusions. It is also up to management to determine what if any remedies to impose.\n[58] Therefore, the AGC asserted and I agree that a CSIS employee such as the Plaintiff may grieve (1) the manner in which the investigation was conducted (as the Court found in Shoan v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 1003 per Justice Zinn), (2) management's decision to accept or reject the investigator's report, and (3) management's decision in relation to remedy. This list is not intended to be exhaustive; it deals only with matters arising in the present litigation. In my respectful view, these findings concerning the scope and range of grievable matters in relation to the Harassment Policy answer the Plaintiff's objections to the Defendants' motion to strike.\n[86] What is missing from this list of matters that may be grieved is the right to grieve whether the alleged conduct of the employees constitutes harassment. The appellant\u2019s dispute is in relation to this conduct and whether this conduct is harassment that could support the causes of action raised in his statement of claim.\n[87] The matters that may be grieved, as identified above by the Federal Court, are limited by the ban on grieving the investigator\u2019s conclusion as set out in article 5.19 of the Harassment Policy. A grievance concerning the manner in which the investigation was conducted would do little to address the dispute related to the conduct of the CSIS employees without being able to challenge the investigator\u2019s conclusion.\n[88] Assume the investigator\u2019s conclusion is that the allegations were unfounded. Assume an employee successfully grieves the manner in which the investigation was conducted. Since the investigator\u2019s conclusion cannot be the subject of a grievance, would the conclusion (that the allegations were unfounded) remain in place? If a grievance related to the manner in which the investigation was conducted could result in the investigator\u2019s conclusion being set aside, this would mean that an employee would be able to do indirectly what that employee could not do directly. It is not plain and obvious that this right to grieve the manner in which the investigation was conducted would be a substantive grievance right.\n[89] Likewise, any grievance arising as a result of management\u2019s acceptance of an investigator\u2019s report that concludes that the allegations are unfounded would presumably not include any right to challenge the investigator\u2019s conclusion.\n[90] Furthermore, the list of matters that could be the subject of a grievance (as identified in paragraph 58 of the reasons of the Federal Court) are all matters that arise as a result of the actions of someone other than the employees whose acts are the subject of the statement of claim. They are not the same matters that are the basis for the statement of claim. The acts that are grievable are the acts of the investigator (the manner in which the investigation was conducted) or management (management\u2019s decision to accept or reject the investigator\u2019s report or management\u2019s decision in relation to a remedy). The acts that give rise to the dispute that resulted in the statement of claim being filed are not the acts of the investigator or management. They are the acts of the appellant\u2019s fellow employees of CSIS.\n[91] There is some support in the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal in Pontbriand v. Administration du r\u00e9gime de soins de sant\u00e9 de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, 2011 QCCA 157 for finding that if a particular procedure excludes a right to grieve, the bar in subsection 236 does not apply. The issue in that case was whether a federal civil servant could commence a Court proceeding against the Federal Public Service Health Care Plan Administration Authority for refusing reimbursement of certain medial expenses that the employee had claimed. The Qu\u00e9bec Court of Appeal found that the dispute did not involve a decision of the employer and, therefore, section 236 of the PSLRA did not apply. The Court also noted, however, that the directive governing the PSHCP excluded the grievance procedure and, therefore, that subsection 208(5) would also have resulted in section 236 not applying:\n[25] As argued by the intervener, the essence of the dispute here is the refusal of the PSHCP Administration to reimburse medical expenses; in short, it is a matter related to the administration of the Public Service Health Care Plan. No employer decision is involved. Moreover, the directive governing the PSHCP excludes the grievance procedure under subsection 208(5) PSHCP. It follows that section 236 PSLRA, which provides that the right of an employee to seek redress by way of grievance is in lieu of any right of action in relation to his or her conditions of employment, does not apply\u2026\n[The Qu\u00e9bec Court of Appeal added emphasis to \u201cconditions of employment\u201d and I added the other emphasis]\n[92] The issue in this appeal is not whether the appellant would be successful in his claim. Rather, the issue is whether \u201cit is plain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action\u201d (R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. referred to in paragraph 7 above). Absent a clear right to grieve whether the alleged conduct of the employees constitutes harassment, in my view, it is not plain and obvious that subsection 236(1) of the FPSLRA would bar the appellant\u2019s claims based on the causes of action identified in his statement of claim that arise from the same conduct of the appellant\u2019s fellow employees.\n[93] As a result, I would allow the appeal and I would not strike the entire statement of claim.\n[94] The remedy the appellant seeks is setting aside the Federal Court Judgment and dismissing the Respondents\u2019 motion brought under Rule 221 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106.\n[95] The Federal Court Judge, in paragraph 21 of his reasons, noted that, if he had not struck the entire statement of claim, he would nonetheless have struck paragraphs 33 and 34 thereof. These paragraphs related to an alleged breach of the Access to Information Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1. The appellant has not provided any submissions that address this finding by the Federal Court Judge. Therefore, the finding that paragraphs 33 and 34 of the statement of claim are struck from the statement of claim would remain in place.\n\u201cWyman W.

She first applied for CPP benefits in 2013, and has since attempted to convince the General Division (GD) and the Appeal Division (AD) of the Social Security Tribunal (SST) to overturn the initial decision to deny her disability application made by Service Canada on July 16, 2013.\n[2] In file A-178-20, Ms. Milner challenges the decision of the AD confirming the earlier decision of the GD to the effect that she failed to present new material facts that would justify reopening its 2018 determination that she had not become disabled by the end of her minimum qualifying period (MQP). In file A-16-21, Ms. Milner asks this Court to quash the decision of the AD confirming the decision of the GD on the merits, alleging that both divisions of the SST committed various errors when they decided that she was not entitled to the CPP disability pension.\n[3] After having carefully reviewed and considered both parties\u2019 records, as well as their written and oral submissions, I have come to the conclusion that the AD did not commit an error in applying subsection 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act, S.C. 2005, c. 34 (DESDA), and that both applications should be dismissed. While I sincerely empathize with Ms. Milner\u2019s situation, I cannot find in her favour in the absence of errors that are sufficiently central and significant to render the decisions under review unreasonable. Ms. Milner obviously disagrees with the AD\u2019s assessment of the GD\u2019s findings, and this is perfectly understandable, but it is insufficient for this Court to intervene in its role as a reviewing court.\nI. Facts [4] Ms. Milner is a former insurance agent and mediator. She applied for CPP benefits on January 31, 2013, claiming that she was no longer able to work as of January 2003 due to peripheral vascular disease (PVD), ischemic colitis, lower back arthritis, neuropathic pain and premature ventricular contractions of her heart (Questionnaire for Disability Benefits, Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at p. 818). The Minister denied her application twice \u2013 initially, and on reconsideration (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at pp. 789-795 and 800-805).\n[5] Ms. Milner appealed the Minister\u2019s reconsideration decision to the GD. After conducting a hearing by written questions and answers, the GD dismissed her appeal (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at p. 726). However, the AD allowed the appeal on February 22, 2018 and returned the matter to the GD for a new hearing on the merits, due to a violation of procedural fairness resulting from the failure to conduct an oral hearing (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at p. 515).\n[6] On August 22, 2018, a different member of the GD dismissed Ms. Milner\u2019s appeal after holding a hearing by way of videoconference. The GD determined that Ms. Milner had not established that she suffered from a severe disability on or before the end of her MQP, which was December 31, 2003, based on her contributions to the CPP. The GD also found that many of Ms. Milner\u2019s conditions arose after her MQP, that the medical evidence and her testimony did not establish a disability that was severe as of December 31, 2003, and that her personal characteristics did not adversely affect her employability at the time of her MQP (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at p. 411).\n[7] Although Ms. Milner was in a \u201cfair amount of pain\u201d and exhibited symptoms before the MQP (such as leg, back, shoulder and temporomandibular joint pain, an injured left thumb, and grief), the GD dismissed their significance on the basis that there was insufficient medical evidence, particularly from Ms. Milner\u2019s family physician, which was the only evidence that was contemporaneous with the MQP, to prove their severity. The GD also relied on Ms. Milner\u2019s family physician\u2019s evidence to infer that these symptoms before the end of her MQP were not significant contributors to her main disability.\n[8] Further, the GD dismissed the significance of the symptoms before the end of her MQP on the basis that the evidence was insufficient, subjective and unreliable. For example, the GD found general inconsistencies with dates and found that Ms. Milner stopped her work positions at the YMCA and at an insurance company for reasons other than medical. Finally, the GD found that Ms. Milner\u2019s personal characteristics did not adversely affect her employability during the MQP.\n[9] While appealing the August 2018 decision, Ms. Milner filed an application to rescind or amend that decision in August of 2019. She filed with her application 6 documents which she argued established new material facts: (a) a hospital emergency record describing her injuries from a motor vehicle accident in January 2003; (b) a family doctor report from July 2019; (c) prescription records from October 2008 to November 2016; (d) blood test results from 1988 to 2018; (e) a gastroscopy report from October 2018 suggesting a prior infection; and (f) an undated mental health narrative, in which she explained that she was unable to discover the above-mentioned medical documents in time for the hearing because she was suffering from mental health issues at the time leading up to the hearing.\n[10] On October 26, 2019, the GD refused to rescind or amend its earlier decision, because in its view, Ms. Milner did not establish new material facts within the meaning of paragraph 66(1)(b) of the DESDA, as it read at the relevant time (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at p. 278). The GD found that none of the evidence submitted was new information that was not discoverable at the time of the hearing and material in that it could be reasonably expected to affect the outcome of Ms. Milner\u2019s claim.\n[11] Ms. Milner then sought leave to appeal this new GD decision, which the AD granted on the basis that she raised at least two arguments having a reasonable chance of success on appeal (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at p. 248). Specifically, the AD found that Ms. Milner had an arguable case that the GD erred (a) when it found that information about her childhood H. Pylori infection could not have reasonably affected the outcome, and (b) when it suggested that the cost of holding another hearing on the merits was a factor in its decision not to admit new information.\n[12] At the merits stage, the AD dismissed Ms. Milner\u2019s appeal on June 10, 2020, being of the view that there was no basis to intervene because the GD did not commit a reviewable error within the meaning of subsection 58(1) of DESDA (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-178-20), at p. 17).\n[13] With respect to Ms. Milner\u2019s submission that she was not well enough to obtain medical records documenting her mental health issues at the time of the July 2018 GD hearing, the AD found that Ms. Milner and her lawyer were aware of additional potentially relevant medical records but chose not to request additional time to obtain them. While Ms. Milner may have been unaware that a postponement was possible, her counsel was presumed to be competent and must have known that such requests are routinely made in adjudicative forums. The AD found that the GD did not act unfairly by relying on Ms. Milner\u2019s counsel\u2019s willingness to proceed with the hearing, even if she now claims that her lawyer made that decision against her informed consent. Nor did the GD err by not taking at face value Ms. Milner\u2019s claim that her mental health issues prevented her from realizing the extent of her problems.\n[14] The AD also found that the GD did not err when it determined that Ms. Milner\u2019s prescription records and blood test results, which predated the GD hearing, were discoverable and could have been adduced before the hearing. It also concluded that the emergency room report from 2003 documenting a visit two weeks after a motor vehicle accident and the family doctor report dated 2019 summarizing her earlier medical history were discoverable and contained information that was already before the GD when it determined that she was not disabled at the relevant time. It was reasonable to expect that Ms. Milner would have at least some idea of the treatment she received and where to obtain information; if she did not have the knowledge or capacity to obtain it herself, she had a lawyer who was presumably hired to help her gather the evidence in support of her case.\n[15] The AD further found that the GD did not err in concluding that the report from Ms. Milner\u2019s gastroenterologist, which stated that she was \u201clikely\u201d infected with H. Pylori from childhood, was not material because it saw no evidence that the bacteria caused any disabling symptoms during the MQP. The AD stressed that new facts are material only if they can be reasonably expected to affect the outcome of a decision. Even if the GD may have failed to recognize the link between H. Pylori and PVD, it could nevertheless focus on the fact that Ms. Milner had not shown that her PVD symptoms prevented her from working before the end of the MQP.\n[16] Finally, the AD found that the GD struck the appropriate balance between efficiency and fairness in deciding to bifurcate the new facts hearing. Far from suggesting that the GD\u2019s decision to defer the arguments on the merits to a second hearing was driven by cost considerations, the AD found that the GD was instead concerned with working out the most logical and efficient way to proceed.\n[17] As for the appeal of the August 2018 GD decision on the merits (File A-16-21), the AD dismissed the appeal on December 16, 2020 (Respondent\u2019s Record (A-16-21), at p. 17). The AD first determined that the GD did not breach procedural fairness when it held a videoconference hearing, in accordance with her stated preference for a videoconference hearing. It further found that she was not treated unfairly on the basis that an in-person hearing could have allowed the GD to notice that she was feeling unwell; she was represented by an experienced lawyer who could have asked for a delay or an adjournment.\n[18] The AD also found no error with the GD\u2019s assessment of the testimonies from Ms. Milner\u2019s aunt and from her former employer. It determined that it was not its role to second-guess the GD\u2019s assessment in the absence of an error, and that the GD\u2019s findings were supported by the evidence before it. The AD also found that the GD did not err by giving some weight to Ms. Milner\u2019s volunteer work. Even if she had given up most of her volunteer activities by the end of her MQP, the GD correctly inferred a degree of functionality, among other factors, from Ms. Milner\u2019s \u201cfairly robust volunteer schedule\u201d during a time where she \u201cclaims to have been increasingly debilitated\u201d (AD (A-16-21), Respondent\u2019s Record (A-16-21), at pp. 25-27, at paras. 31-35).\n[19] As for Ms. Milner\u2019s painkiller consumption, the AD further found no error with the GD\u2019s findings that there was no medical evidence that she was taking painkillers for generalized pain before the end of her MQP. Contrary to Ms. Milner\u2019s submissions, the AD saw no indication that the GD mischaracterized her doctor\u2019s notes or selectively considered the material before it. The AD similarly found that it could not overturn the decision of the GD simply because Ms. Milner disagrees with the weight given to her grief following her cousin\u2019s death. To the extent that the GD did not base its decision on a factual error, it was entitled to consider evidence as it saw fit. Finally, the AD found that the GD did not err in relying on Ms. Milner\u2019s family doctor\u2019s notes or drawing inferences from these notes, and saw no indication that it made illogical or unsupportable presumptions along the way.\nII. Issues [20] In her written and oral submissions, Ms. Milner raises many of the same arguments that she made before the AD. They mostly relate to alleged errors of fact and to the weight given to the evidence. In file A-178-20, she also makes new procedural fairness arguments. More particularly, she claims that she was treated unfairly first because the same member decided all three AD decisions, and second because the Minister\u2019s representative was allowed to ask her questions about privileged conversations she had with her lawyer.\n[21] Before grappling with Ms. Milner\u2019s various arguments, I shall first deal with the applicable standard of review. In a case such as this one, it is often the most determinative factor of the analysis. I will then turn to the merits of the two decisions under review, and to the AD\u2019s alleged breaches of procedural fairness.\nIII. Analysis A. The standard of review [22] The first thing to be emphasized is that the role of this Court, on judicial review, is not to assess the decision of the GD. The focus of our enquiry is the decision of the AD. In performing this role, the jurisdiction of the AD must also be kept in mind. Pursuant to subsection 58(1) of the DESDA, the AD is neither a reviewing court in the judicial sense of the word, nor is it conducting a de novo hearing: Glover v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FC 363 at para. 19; Marcia v. Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 1367 at para. 34; Canada (Attorney General) v. Jean, 2015 FCA 242 at para. 19. Specifically, the AD can only intervene if it finds that the GD (1) acted unfairly, (2) erred in law (whether or not the error appears on the face of the record), or (3) \u201cbased its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it\u201d.\n[23] It is by now well established that AD decisions are reviewable on the standard of reasonableness: see, for example, Atkinson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2014 FCA 187 at paras. 24-32; Garvey v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 118 at para. 1 [Garvey]; Sjogren v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 157 at para. 6; Parks v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FCA 91 at para. 8 [Parks]; Stavropoulos v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FCA 109 at para. 11; Riccio v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 108 at para. 5; Mudie v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 239 at para. 18, leave to appeal to the Supreme Court refused, 2022 CanLII 74314 (S.C.C.); Balkanyi v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 164 at paras. 12 and 13; Canada (Attorney General) v. Ibrahim, 2023 FCA 204 at para. 13. The question to be decided, therefore, is not whether Ms. Milner was entitled to a disability pension, but whether the AD\u2019s decision to confirm the GD\u2019s decision on the basis of no unfairness, error in law or erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner, and the reasons for so deciding, are reasonable. As the Supreme Court stated in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at paras. 83 and 84 [Vavilov], the task of a reviewing court is not to decide the issue according to its own yardstick, but to approach the reasons provided by the administrative decision-maker with \u201crespectful attention\u201d, with a view to understanding both the chain of analysis and the conclusion. Needless to say, the threshold is high to show that a decision is unreasonable.\n[24] As for questions of procedural fairness, they must be reviewed on the correctness standard: Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa, 2009 SCC 12 at para. 43; Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 at para. 54. Accordingly, this Court owes no deference to the AD and must determine whether the AD itself breached Ms. Milner\u2019s right to procedural fairness. On the other hand, this Court must also decide whether the AD acted reasonably in refusing to find that the GD acted unfairly.\nB. Are the AD decisions reasonable? (1) A-178-20 [25] Pursuant to paragraph 66(1)(b) of the DESDA, as it read at the relevant time, the SST could rescind or amend a decision if it was presented with a new material fact that was not discoverable at the time of the hearing with the exercise of reasonable diligence. This is a narrow exception to the principle that SST decisions are binding and final, subject only to statutory appeal or judicial review: Canada (Attorney General) v. Jagpal, 2008 FCA 38 at para. 27. A new fact will be \u201cmaterial\u201d if it could reasonably be expected to have affected the outcome of the hearing: Kent v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 FCA 420 at para. 34 [Kent]. This is a question of mixed fact and law (see Mazzotta v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 297 at para. 37 [Mazzotta]), and in the present case, a fact will be material if it is related to Ms. Milner\u2019s capacity as of December 31, 2003 (the end of her MQP). As for discoverability, Ms. Milner must show that the new fact could not have been discovered \u201cwith the exercise of reasonable diligence\u201d at the time of the hearing. This has been characterized as a question of fact (Mazzotta, at para. 37), or as a highly fact-driven question of mixed fact and law (Carepa v. Canada (Minister of Social Development), 2006 FC 1319 at paras. 17 and 18, citing Taylor v. Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development), 2005 FCA 293 at para. 12 [Taylor]). In a case like this one, discoverability will usually involve knowledge of the document, steps taken to discover it, and the justification as to why it was not produced at the hearing.\n[26] After having carefully considered Ms. Milner\u2019s oral and written submissions, I am unable to find in her favour. Ms. Milner\u2019s submissions amount, by and large, to mere disagreements with the AD\u2019s assessment of the GD\u2019s decision. This is not sufficient for a reviewing court to intervene. Before setting aside a decision on the basis that it is unreasonable, the reviewing court must be satisfied that the alleged flaws or shortcomings are not merely peripheral to the merits of the decision but rather, sufficiently significant to strip it of the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility and transparency: Vavilov at para. 100. This is a high threshold to meet, especially in the context of such an exceptional recourse as that set out in paragraph 66(1)(b) of the DESDA.\n[27] I have summarized in considerable detail the decisions of the GD and the AD in this file to show that Ms. Milner\u2019s arguments have already been carefully considered and dealt with. It is not for this Court to make its own assessment of the GD\u2019s decision, nor to reconsider the AD\u2019s decision against its own conclusions: Parks at para. 8. As this Court stated in Kent at para. 35, the test for determining the existence of new facts must be applied in a flexible manner, such that it allows for the balancing of the Minister\u2019s legitimate interest in the finality of decisions and the need to encourage claimants to put their best foot forward, and the equally legitimate interest of claimants in having their claims assessed fairly and reasonably.\n[28] Ms. Milner claims that the AD erred in many respects in concluding that the GD did not commit any errors in finding that she failed to present new material facts that would justify reopening its August 2018 decision. I will now briefly deal with these alleged errors.\n[29] Ms. Milner first submits that her family doctor\u2019s report dated July 15, 2019 did not exist at the time of the initial hearing and should have been allowed as a new fact as it supplements the record with allegedly new findings with respect to her health predicaments that would have predated the end of her MQP. The AD agreed with the GD that the report\u2019s content could have been discovered at the time of the initial hearing before the GD, and that the file already contained many other reports that covered similar information as the family doctor\u2019s post-hearing letter. This finding is consistent with previous decisions of this Court, according to which medical reports that merely reiterate what is already known or has been diagnosed will not be considered evidence of new facts: see, for example, Taylor at para. 13; Canada (Attorney General) v. MacRAE, 2008 FCA 82 at para. 17.\n[30] As for Ms. Milner\u2019s blood test results and prescription records, the GD had found that it was discoverable at the time of the hearing. The AD could reasonably find that there was no basis to intervene in that decision. These reports were clearly discoverable since Ms. Milner must have been aware that she had undergone investigations and taken medications. As noted by the AD, even if she might not have had the knowledge or capacity to obtain that information, she was represented by counsel whose role was to help her obtain and produce relevant documents in advance of the hearing before the GD. The same is true of Ms. Milner\u2019s 2003 emergency room records; not only were these reports discoverable at the time of the initial GD hearing because Ms. Milner and her lawyer knew about the accident, but the information about the motor vehicle accident and her resulting injuries were already before the GD.\n[31] With regard to the letter from Ms. Milner\u2019s gastroenterologist dated November 20, 2018, which provides that she tested positive for H. Pylori and that she likely acquired this infection in childhood, the AD could reasonably conclude that there was no reason to interfere with the GD\u2019s finding that this information was not material. It is an applicant\u2019s capacity to work due to disability that determines whether a disability is severe under the CPP, not the diagnosis of a disease per se: see Klabouch v. Canada (Social Development), 2008 FCA 33 at para. 14. As noted by the AD, even if we accept that Ms. Milner was infected with H. Pylori as a child and that H. Pylori is associated with PVD, a positive test for H. Pylori says nothing about whether PVD produces disabling symptoms and, if so, whether disabling symptoms were present on or before December 31, 2003. Ms. Milner has not convinced me that this finding was unreasonable.\n[32] Ms. Milner also challenged the AD\u2019s finding that the GD did not err in its treatment of her mental health narrative, which she submitted in advance of the second GD hearing. In that statement, Ms. Milner provided her written testimony of her personal experiences with grief and addiction between January 2003 and the second GD hearing, explaining that she was not well enough to obtain medical records documenting her mental health issues. The testimony also stated that she asked her lawyer to postpone the hearing, but her lawyer advised against it. The GD determined that counsel could have requested an adjournment to adduce the missing medical records, and the AD reasonably found no error in that decision. Not only had counsel made requests for medical documents that were not received by the GD at the time of the initial hearing, but counsel is presumed to be competent and to know that she could have requested an adjournment.\n[33] Finally, Ms. Milner argues that the GD erred in determining that it would hold a separate hearing on the merits of her CPP claim only if it found that she established a new material fact, and that the AD unreasonably found no basis to intervene in that decision. Once again, I am of the view that this argument is without merit. It is clear that a decision to reconsider a prior decision based on new material facts involves two distinct decisions: Kent at para. 18. First, a decision-maker must determine whether there are new material facts; if not, the original decision will stand. It is only if new material facts are established that the decision-maker will go on to reassess the applicant\u2019s pension entitlement on the basis of the new material facts and of the existing record. There would be no point in assessing the potential impact of an applicant\u2019s new evidence if it was later to be found that this new evidence does not meet the test for materiality or discoverability. While the GD member alluded to the cost of a second hearing, it is clear that his primary concern was to proceed in the most logical and efficient way.\n[34] Before this Court, Ms. Milner raises two new arguments of procedural fairness. First, she claims that she was treated unfairly on the basis that the same member decided all three appeal decisions. She also raises this argument in her application for judicial review in Court file number A-16-21. Second, she contends that she was treated unfairly because the GD member allowed the Minister\u2019s representative to ask her questions about privileged conversations she had with her lawyer. The GD member did advise her that these conversations were privileged and that she did not need to disclose that information, but only after she provided two preliminary answers and she was put in the difficult position to either answer the questions or be seen to avoid the questions.\n[35] I agree with the respondent that an alleged breach of procedural fairness must be raised at the earliest practicable opportunity: Hennessey v. Canada, 2016 FCA 180 at para. 21; Benitez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 461 at para. 220, aff\u2019d 2007 FCA 199, leave to appeal to the Supreme Court refused, 2007 CanLII 55337 (S.C.C.); Mohammadian v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] 3 F.C. 371 at para. 25 (Fed. T.D.). Ms. Milner knew that the same member presided over her case three times, yet did not raise any concern or object that it was improper for the member to preside until her appeals were dismissed. Similarly, she knew that she had been asked questions about conversations she had with her lawyer during the last GD hearing, yet she did not raise that argument before the AD. Moreover, she was advised by the GD member that the questions about her conversations with her lawyer were privileged, but nevertheless answered the questions and told the member that she did not mind discussing those conversations. It is therefore too late to argue that her right to procedural fairness has been breached.\n(2) A-16-21 [36] The CPP is a compulsory contributory and earnings-related scheme. Three criteria must be satisfied to qualify for a CPP disability pension, pursuant to subsection 42(2), paragraph 44(1)(b), and subsection 44(2) of the Canada Pension Plan, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-8 (CPP Act). An applicant must meet the contributory requirements, be found disabled within the meaning of the CPP Act, and continue to be disabled. In the case at bar, it is the second condition that is at play. It is not in dispute that Ms. Milner meets the contributory requirements, and that the latest date by which she must be found disabled to be entitled to a CPP is December 31, 2003 (MQP).\n[37] To be \u201cdisabled\u201d, Ms. Milner must prove through medical evidence and with due regard to the \u201creal world context\u201d that she was more likely than not to have a disability that was severe and prolonged on or before the end of her MQP: see Warren v. Canada (Attorney General), 2008 FCA 377 at para. 4; Canada (Attorney General) v. Angell, 2020 FC 1093 at para. 40; Bungay v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FCA 47 at para. 8; Villani v. Canada (Attorney General), 2001 FCA 248 at paras. 32 and 38 [Villani]. A disability is severe if it causes Ms. Milner \u201cto be incapable regularly of pursuing any substantially gainful occupation\u201d: CPP Act, subparagraph 42(2)(a)(i); Villani at paras. 44 and 50. Where there is evidence of some capacity for work, disability claimants must show that efforts to obtain and maintain employment have been unsuccessful because of their health conditions. A disability is prolonged if it is \u201clikely to be long, continued and of indefinite duration or likely to result in death\u201d: CPP Act, subparagraph 42(2)(a)(ii); Litke v. Canada (Human Resources and Social Development), 2008 FCA 366 at para. 5.\n[38] Ms. Milner submits that the AD made several errors of fact. She claims, for example, that too much weight was given to her volunteer activities, without taking into account that she eventually had to give them up by the end of her MQP due to her pain. The GD did indeed find that Ms. Milner appeared to have been doing a significant amount of volunteer work in the years 2000 to 2002. However, as reasonably noted by the AD, the GD did not base its decision solely on Ms. Milner\u2019s volunteer involvement, but also on evidence that many of her medical conditions arose after the MQP, the absence of compelling signs of disability in her family doctor\u2019s notes from 2003 to 2004, and inconsistencies that raised questions about the reliability of her testimony. Moreover, the AD could reasonably find that the GD was entitled to consider Ms. Milner\u2019s volunteer work when assessing whether she retained work capacity; while volunteer work cannot be the sole basis to deny benefits, it can be used to infer functionality when considered in combination with other factors. The evidence that Ms. Milner was engaged in volunteer work while she was working for an insurance brokerage in 2001 was considered relevant to assessing her work capacity by the GD, since it contradicted testimony that her job ended because she was medically unable to complete brokerage courses on top of her full-time work. The AD was entitled to find no error in that factual assessment.\n[39] Ms. Milner also complains about the weight given to her biological aunt\u2019s and former employer\u2019s testimonies. Her aunt\u2019s testimony was to the effect that, like her niece, she suffers from PVD and that it took a long time before she was properly diagnosed. As for her former employer, he testified that she often missed work and ultimately, was unable to get through the courses required to become a licensed broker. The GD did not place much weight on Ms. Milner\u2019s aunt\u2019s testimony, because the issue has never been whether and when she had PVD, but rather when she became impaired to the point where she could no longer regularly perform substantially gainful employment. As for her former employer\u2019s testimony, the GD did not deny that Ms. Milner was experiencing pain at the time but found that there were likely other reasons than impairment to explain why she did not become a broker.\n[40] In my view, the AD could reasonably refuse to interfere with the GD\u2019s assessment of the evidence. Paragraph 58(1)(c) of the DESDA provides that only factual errors made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the evidence on which a decision is based constitute errors of fact. This is a high threshold. As this Court stated in Garvey at paragraph 6, a finding will be perverse, capricious or made without regard to the evidence if it squarely contradicts or is unsupported by the evidence. In the case at bar, Ms. Milner\u2019s arguments before the AD amounted to mere disagreement with the GD\u2019s assessment of the testimonies given by her aunt and former employer. The GD\u2019s factual findings were supported by the evidence, and the fact that the AD or, for that matter, this Court, may have decided the case differently is no ground to interfere with the GD\u2019s decision: see Cameron v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 100 at para. 2; Nelson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 222 at para. 17.\n[41] The same is true with respect to Ms. Milner\u2019s argument that the GD did not give enough weight to her grief following her cousin\u2019s death, and erred in the inferences it drew from her family doctor\u2019s office notes. Once again, the AD determined that the GD was fully aware of and considered the evidence that was put forward by Ms. Milner with respect to her grief-related stress, and that it was not its proper role to revisit how the GD chose to weigh that evidence. Similarly, the AD found that the GD did not err in concluding, on the basis of Ms. Milner\u2019s family doctor\u2019s clinical notes, that she was not experiencing generalized pain (which formed the basis of her application for CPP benefits) or that she was not taking pain medication for generalized pain before the end of her MQP, and that Tylenol 3 was prescribed to address only localized pain until May 2004. There was no basis for the AD to set aside these conclusions, which were all supported by fulsome review of the evidence.\n[42] Finally, Ms. Milner submits that the AD incorrectly found that the GD did not breach her right to procedural fairness by holding a videoconference hearing. More specifically, she argues that if the hearing had been in person, the GD could have noticed that she was not well. Once again, this argument is without merit. First of all, as noted by the AD, Ms. Milner never insisted on an in-person hearing before the GD; on the contrary, she indicated in writing that she preferred to proceed either by videoconference or by personal appearance. The AD therefore correctly determined that the GD did nothing more than agree to one of Ms. Milner\u2019s stated preferences. Moreover, there is no indication that Ms. Milner insisted on an in-person hearing before the GD. Finally, the AD was correct in pointing out that she was represented by counsel before the GD; since lawyers are presumed to act in accordance with their client\u2019s instructions and best interests, the GD was justified to assume that she was ready to proceed in the absence of any request for a postponement or adjournment before or during the hearing.\nIV. Conclusion [43] For all the above reasons, I would dismiss these applications for judicial review, without costs. I realize that this is not the conclusion Ms. Milner hoped for. In light of the record that is before us, however, I am unable to find in her favour. As indicated above, I sympathize with her plight. However, I find that the decisions of the AD not to interfere with the GD\u2019s determinations that she failed to present new material facts and that she was not disabled within the meaning of the CPP by her MQP were reasonable.\n\u201cYves de Montigny\u201d\nC.J.\n\u201cI agree.\nGeorge R.

E-15 (the Act) be granted or to commence an appeal to the Tax Court of Canada was dismissed by the Tax Court of Canada (per Visser J., Tax Court File No. 2018-1186(GST)APP).\n[2] This is an appeal from the Order of the Tax Court dismissing the appellant\u2019s application. The issue in this appeal is whether the Tax Court judge erred in dismissing this application.\n[3] The following dates and events are relevant in this matter:\nDate\nEvent\nDecember 14, 2014\nA notice of reassessment was issued following the appellant\u2019s filing of its GST return for the reporting period from January 5, 2010 to December 31, 2010 (the Reporting Period). The GST return was filed in response to an arbitrary assessment issued on November 18, 2011. The Minister had previously requested, on two separate occasions, that the appellant file its GST return. This is the relevant notice of reassessment in this matter.\nNovember 2, 2015\nThe appellant submitted a notice of objection to the Minister.\nNovember 27, 2015\nThe Minister rejected the notice of objection because it was not filed within the time limit set out in subsection 301(1.1) of the Act (within 90 days after the date the notice of reassessment was sent to the appellant). The appellant was informed that it would have to request an extension of time to file the notice of objection. This application would have to be made within one year after the expiration of the time period within which the appellant could have filed an objection without an extension of time.\nJune 25, 2017\nThe appellant wrote to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) requesting that the CRA accept an amended return for the Reporting Period.\nJuly 27, 2017\nThe CRA informed the appellant that it would not be reassessed based on the amended return.\nOctober 23, 2017\nThe appellant submitted, to the Minister, a request for an extension of time to object in response to the letter from the CRA dated July 27, 2017.\nNovember 28, 2017\nThe Minister rejected the application on the basis that the time within which an application could have been made to object to the notice of reassessment (which was issued on December 14, 2014) expired on March 16, 2016 and therefore the request was too late.\nApril 5, 2018\nThe appellant filed the application with the Tax Court referred to in paragraph 1 above.\n[4] Subsection 304(5) of the Act provides that the Tax Court cannot grant an application to extend the time to object to an assessment unless the conditions set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) are satisfied. Paragraph (a) provides that the appellant must have filed its application to the Minister to extend the time to object within one year after the expiration of the time period within which the appellant could have filed an objection without an extension of time. The letter from the CRA dated July 27, 2017 is not an assessment. The relevant reassessment in this matter is dated December 14, 2014. The time period within which the appellant could have requested an extension of time to object to this reassessment expired on March 16, 2016.\n[5] Since the appellant only applied after March 16, 2016 to the Minister to request an extension of time to object to the relevant reassessment, there is no basis on which the Tax Court could have granted an extension of time for the appellant to object to this reassessment. The Tax Court did not err in dismissing this application.\n[6] Filing a valid notice of objection is a condition precedent to commencing an appeal to the Tax Court (Beima v. Canada, 2016 FCA 205, at paragraph 14). Since the appellant did not file a valid notice of objection, the time period to commence an appeal to the Tax Court has not commenced. As noted in Beima, at paragraph 14, \u201c[a]n extension of time is not available if the time period has not commenced\u201d.\n[7] The Act stipulates specific requirements for making an objection to the Minister and filing an appeal to the Tax Court. The appellant did not comply with these requirements. Neither the Tax Court nor this Court has the jurisdiction (either equitable or otherwise) to waive compliance with or modify these statutory requirements.\n[8] The Tax Court Judge did not err in dismissing the appellant\u2019s application for an extension of time to file an appeal to the Tax Court.\n[9] This appeal will be dismissed with costs.\n\"Wyman W.

(Micsau), through its shares in 3295940 Canada Inc. (3295 or the appellant), held an indirect minority stake in a generic drug business. The majority owner began negotiations to sell the business to a third party. Thus, Micsau had to sell its stake in the business.\n[2] Micsau wished to use the high tax cost in its 3295 shares. 3295\u2019s tax cost in the underlying business was much lower, so selling that stake through 3295 would have created a higher capital gain. Therefore, Micsau wished to sell its 3295 shares in order to use its high tax cost. For reasons I will explain below, Micsau could not sell its shares in 3295. Faced with these circumstances, Micsau initiated a series of transactions, which replicated the tax consequences of Micsau selling its 3295 shares.\n[3] To borrow liberally from one author, what should then have been a \u201cplain-vanilla tax\u2011planning opportunity\u201d whereby Micsau used its high cost to be taxed on its true economic gain ended up being, for the Tax Court of Canada, an abusive avoidance transaction by 3295: Eric Hamelin, \u201cGAAR Applicable to the Circular Payment of Capital Dividends\u201d (2023) 71:3 Can Tax J 859 at 868 [Hamelin].\n[4] In light of the true nature and overall result of the series of transactions, there was no abuse of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (the Act). For the following reasons, I would allow the appeal.\nI. Factual Background [5] Shakespeare once wrote that \u201cbrevity is the soul of wit\u201d. Much as I wish to implement this maxim, I must recount the facts in some depth. I omit certain minor details for simplicity. Keen readers may consult an even more fulsome recitation of the facts in the Partial Agreed Statement of Facts (PASOF) attached to the Tax Court\u2019s decision. Unless otherwise specified, the facts are taken from the PASOF.\nA. Initial Situation [6] Before the series of transactions, the corporate structure was as follows.\n[7] As illustrated, Micsau wholly owned 3295, and 3295 owned a minority stake in Holdings. RoundTable, an American investment fund, owned the remaining shares and thus controlled Holdings. Holdings owned an operating company (Sabex 2002), which carried on a generic drug business.\n[8] As also illustrated, Micsau\u2019s shares in 3295 had an adjusted cost base (ACB) of $48.1M and a fair market value (FMV) of $101.8M. 3295\u2019s shares in Holdings had an ACB of $4M and a FMV of $88.5M. The difference between the ACB of the shares in Holdings and those in 3295 is due to a transaction that occurred two years before the relevant period when Micsau bought shares in 3295 from another shareholder and became 3295\u2019s sole shareholder. Micsau paid $47.46M for these additional shares. As for the difference between the FMV of the shares in Holdings and those in 3295, it is attributable to 3295 having $13.3M of cash.\nB. Roundtable Negotiates to Sell Holdings [9] In 2004, RoundTable began negotiations to sell 100% ownership of Holdings to a third party, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (Novartis). One option for executing this sale was for Micsau to sell its shares in 3295 to Novartis. This option would have generated a capital gain of $53.7M ($101.8M \u2013 $48.1M). Comparatively, 3295 selling its shares in Holdings would have been inefficient: these shares\u2019 low ACB would have generated a capital gain of $84.5M ($88.5M \u2013 $4M). With this information in mind, Micsau\u2019s business and tax adviser submitted to RoundTable\u2014which had the exclusive right to negotiate with Novartis and to make decisions regarding the sale to Novartis\u2014the following alternative transactions:\na)Micsau sells its shares in 3295 to Novartis;\nb)3295 merges with Holdings: This merger would create a new, amalgamated corporation (AmalCo). Micsau would have the same ACB in its AmalCo shares as its ACB in its 3295 shares. Micsau would sell its AmalCo shares;\nc)A tuck-under reorganization is undertaken: Micsau would transfer its 3295 shares to Holdings in consideration for shares in Holdings on a taxable basis, allowing Micsau to use its high ACB in computing its resulting capital gain. Micsau would then sell its Holdings shares to Novartis. Holdings and 3295 would be in cross\u2011ownership, but the cross ownership could be eliminated without additional tax through an amalgamation; or\nd)Micsau sells its 3295 shares to RoundTable: RoundTable could then wind up 3295, the ACB of 3295\u2019s shares would transfer to the Holdings shares, and RoundTable would sell the Holdings shares to Novartis.\nUnder each of these options, Micsau would use its high ACB to realize a $53.7M gain, and Novartis would acquire 100% of the shares in Holdings.\n(Transcript of hearing of September 8, 2020, Appeal Book, vol. 2 at 1032, 1034\u201336, 1040\u201343 [Sept. 8 Transcript]; Transcript of hearing of September 9, 2020, Appeal Book, vol. 2 at 1149\u201350 [Sept. 9 Transcript]; 3295940 Canada Inc. v. The Queen, 2022 TCC 68 at para. 152 [TCC Reasons].)\n[10] It appears that RoundTable, not wanting to impede the momentum of the sale, did not put the first three transactions to Novartis. Nevertheless, RoundTable said Novartis was unwilling to acquire the 3295 shares due to potential legacy liabilities. The last proposal involved RoundTable, not Novartis, acquiring shares in 3295. RoundTable rejected the proposal, saying it did not want to be left with a Canadian subsidiary (3295) following the sale of Holdings: Sept. 8 Transcript at 1032\u201335, 1043\u201344, 1067\u201368; Sept. 9 Transcript at 1114\u201315, 1153\u201355.\n[11] Once Novartis and RoundTable agreed to terms for the sale of Holdings, Micsau\u2019s adviser was able to speak to Novartis. Assuming that Novartis did not want to acquire the 3295 shares directly or indirectly, the adviser proposed selling the shares of a new corporation: Sept. 8 Transcript at 1035; Sept. 9 Transcript at 1114\u201315.\n[12] Novartis accepted the proposal in exchange for a $1.5M reduction of the purchase price: Sept. 9 Transcript at 1108\u201309. It is not clear from the evidence how this reduction of $1.5M was reflected in the numbers below. However, this is not material to the resolution of the issue before this Court.\n[13] As a result, the following transactions occurred.\nC. Series of Transactions (1) Micsau creates 31.5M Class D shares [14] Micsau exchanged its shares in 3295 for (1) Class D preferred shares with $31.5M of ACB and FMV and (2) 100 common shares with $16.6M of ACB and $70.3M of FMV. This had the effect of transferring a portion of Micsau\u2019s high ACB to the newly-created Class D shares.\n(2) Micsau transfers the Class D shares to 4244 [15] Micsau transferred the Class D shares in 3295, for $31.5M, to a newly created subsidiary: 4244851 Canada Inc. (4244). In consideration, 4244 issued to Micsau Class D shares with an ACB and FMV of $31.5M. Micsau\u2019s Class D shares in 3295 had an ACB equal to the price at which it transferred those shares to 4244; consequently, this transaction created no capital gain. The resulting corporate diagram, which excludes RoundTable for simplicity, was as follows:\n[16] I wish to pause here to note a foundational point. The proposal Novartis accepted was the sale of shares in a new corporation (4244) for $88.5M. As we will see, two \u201clots\u201d of 4244 shares will be sold to Novartis. The first lot is the Micsau\u2019s 31.5M Class D shares in 4244.\n(3) 3295 sells its Holdings shares to 4244\n[17] 3295 transferred its Holdings shares, worth $88.5M, to 4244. To make this an even trade, 4244 issued $88.5M worth of shares: (1) 57M Class D shares, worth $57M and (2) 31.5M common shares, worth $31.5M. As the Act permits, 3295 elected to recognize, not $88.5M, but $57M in proceeds of disposition. Consequently, 3295 realized a $53M capital gain ($57M \u2013 $4M). That gain is roughly the gain Micsau would have realized if it had sold its 3295 shares to Novartis. Due to the election, 3295\u2019s shares in 4244 had $57M of ACB, which went to the 57M Class D shares. This left 3295\u2019s 31.5M common shares with no ACB.\n[18] As the Act provides, half of 3295\u2019s gain was taxed, and half was added to 3295\u2019s Capital Dividend Account (CDA). The CDA represents amounts, including capital gains\u2019 non-taxable portion, which a corporation can distribute tax-free. Accordingly, 3295\u2019s capital gain increased the CDA balance by $26.5M, yielding a total CDA of $32.28M.\n[19] The corporate diagram after these transactions was as follows:\n[20] I pause to note that the second \u201clot\u201d of 4244 shares that will be sold to Novartis is the 57M Class D shares that 3295 acquired when it sold the Holdings shares to 4244.\n(4) Eliminating the cross-ownership between 3295 and 4244 [21] Since Micsau had been told Novartis did not want to own shares in 3295 directly or indirectly, the series could not contemplate Novartis purchasing a company (4244) that was in a cross-ownership with 3295. Hence, 4244 and 3295 eliminated the cross-ownership before the sale to Novartis.\n[22] It is important to recognize that eliminating the cross-ownership did not change the value of what Novartis wanted to purchase. Irrespective of the cross-ownership, the underlying drug business\u2019 value was $88.5M. That value was reflected in the two \u201clots\u201d of shares: (1) Micsau\u2019s 31.5M Class D shares in 4244, worth $31.5M and (2) 3295\u2019s 57M Class D shares in 4244, worth $57M.\n[23] The cross-ownership was eliminated through a cross-redemption. First, 3295 redeemed 4244\u2019s Class D shares for a promissory note of $31.5M. Under the Act, this resulted in 4244 being deemed to have received a $31.5M dividend from 3295. 3295 elected to treat this dividend as a capital dividend. Consequently, the dividend was not taxable, and 4244\u2019s CDA increased by $31.5M (with 3295\u2019s CDA decreasing correspondingly). Second, 4244 redeemed 3295\u2019s common shares, also for a promissory note of $31.5M. This resulted in 3295 being deemed to have received a $31.5M dividend from 4244. 4244 elected to treat this dividend as a capital dividend. Consequently, the dividend was not taxable, 4244\u2019s CDA balance was eliminated, and 3295\u2019s CDA was restored. Finally, 3295 and 4244 offset the two promissory notes. After these transactions, the corporate diagram was as follows:\n(5) Micsau transfers its 4244 shares to 3295\n[24] Micsau transferred to 3295 the first lot of shares\u2014the 31.5M Class D shares in 4244. In exchange, 3295 issued 31.5M Class D shares to Micsau. The corporate diagram after these transactions was as follows:\n[25] As the diagram illustrates, 3295 owned all the 4244 Class D shares, which had $88.5M of FMV and ACB. These shares come from the two lots discussed above. The first lot, the 31.5M Class D shares, are the ones Micsau obtained by using its high ACB in the first steps of the series, described at paragraphs [14] and [15] above. The second lot, the 57M Class D shares, comprises shares on which 3295 paid full tax in step 3 of the series, described at paragraphs [17] and [18].\n(6) 3295 sells both lots to Novartis\n[26] 3295 sold all its shares in 4244 to Novartis for $88.5M. Because the shares\u2019 sale price and ACB were equal, 3295 realized no additional capital gain from this sale.\n(7) 3295 sends Micsau $31.5M of cash\n[27] Finally, 3295 redeemed, for $31.5M, the Class D shares it issued to Micsau in step 5 of the series, described in paragraph [24]. 3295 used the funds it received from Novartis on the sale. This transaction resulted in no tax liability. The corporate structure after the series of transactions can be illustrated as follows:\nD. The Minister\u2019s Reassessment [28] The Minister of National Revenue (Minister) reassessed 3295 pursuant to the General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) in section 245 of the Act. The GAAR applies when a series of transactions meets three requirements. First, a tax benefit must arise from the series of transactions. Second, there must be avoidance, meaning the series was undertaken primarily for the purpose of obtaining a tax benefit. Third, the avoidance must be abusive. Abuse occurs when the result of the series frustrates the object, spirit, and purpose of a provision of the Act or of the Act as a whole.\n[29] The Minister\u2019s reassessment applied the GAAR to add a $31.5M of capital gain to 3295\u2019s income. The Minister said Micsau and 3295 carried out a series of avoidance transactions that resulted in a tax benefit\u2014namely, a $31.5M reduction in the capital gain 3295 would have realized if it had directly sold its shares in Holdings to Novartis. The Minister said the series allowed 3295 to abuse:\na)the Act\u2019s regime regarding the taxation of capital gains, found in paragraphs 3(b), 38(1), 39(1)(a), and 40(1)(a);\nb)the Act\u2019s scheme governing capital dividends provided for in subsections 83(2) and 89(1); and\nc)subsection 55(2).\n[30] Before reviewing the Tax Court\u2019s analysis, I will briefly summarize these provisions and the context in which they operate.\nII. Overview of Allegedly Abused Provisions A. Capital Gains Regime [31] Capital gains represent the accrued economic gain a taxpayer realizes when she disposes of a capital asset: paragraph 39(1)(a). One calculates capital gains as the proceeds of disposition (POD) minus the adjusted cost base (ACB): subsection 40(1). For example, if a taxpayer buys a capital asset for $100 and sells it for $150, she realizes a $50 capital gain; that is, $150 POD minus $100 ACB. Only half of capital gains are taxable: paragraph 38(a). Thus, in our example, the taxpayer\u2019s taxable capital gain is only $25; that is, half of the $50 capital gain.\nB. Capital Dividends [32] Parliament\u2019s objective is to tax half of capital gains, whether they are earned directly by an individual or indirectly through a corporation. Where a private corporation realizes a capital gain, the non-taxable portion is added to the corporation\u2019s Capital Dividend Account (CDA). As mentioned, the CDA represents amounts, including capital gains\u2019 non-taxable portion, which a corporation can distribute to its shareholders tax-free via capital dividends. Without this feature, the system would tax the non-taxable portion of the capital gain. When the distributing corporation pays a capital dividend to a corporate shareholder, the distributing corporation\u2019s CDA decreases by the amount of the dividend, and the corporate shareholder\u2019s CDA increases by that amount. These provisions are found in subsections 83(2) and 89(1).\nC. Subsection 55(2) [33] Subsection 55(2) operates in the context of the intercorporate dividend regime. Key to that regime is subsection 112(1), which says that a taxable dividend that a corporate shareholder receives from a Canadian corporation is deductible from that shareholder\u2019s income. As a result, the corporate shareholder receives this dividend tax-free. The rationale is that this dividend has been paid from after-tax earnings; taxing it again in the hands of the recipient corporation would result in double taxation.\n[34] Subsection 55(2) serves a dual purpose.\n[35] First, it prevents \u201ccapital gains stripping\u201d. Capital gains stripping happens when a corporation, before its shares are sold, reduces its value by paying an intercorporate dividend to its corporate shareholder, thereby converting a capital gain into a tax-free intercorporate dividend. An example can illustrate the effect of subsection 55(2). Suppose ACo wholly owns BCo. BCo has an asset worth $100. BCo pays a $99 intercorporate dividend to ACo, which receives that dividend tax-free. ACo could then sell its shares in BCo to a third party for $1. Using this manoeuvre, ACo would turn a $100 sale into a $1 sale and, in so doing, transform what would have been a taxable capital gain into a tax-free intercorporate dividend. Subsection 55(2) prevents this sort of tax plan by deeming the $99 dividend to be part of ACo\u2019s capital gain from its sale of BCo\u2019s shares.\n[36] Second, subsection 55(2) protects the tax-free flow of dividends attributable to income that has already been taxed in the corporation paying the dividend: Canada v. Kruco Inc., 2003 FCA 284 at para. 32 [Kruco]. To continue with the previous example, if BCo had $10 of after\u2011tax income, it could pay a $10 dividend to ACo prior to its sale. Subsection 55(2) would allow such a dividend. The underlying assumption is that dividends in excess of after-tax profits\u2014in our example dividends in excess of $10\u2014represent the untaxed appreciation of capital assets: Kruco at para. 32; Ottawa Air Cargo Centre Ltd. v. The Queen, 2007 TCC 193 at para. 27, aff\u2019d 2008 FCA 54.\n[37] With this legislative context in mind, I now turn to the Tax Court\u2019s decision.\nIII. Tax Court Decision [38] The Tax Court had to decide whether the GAAR applied to the series of transactions. 3295 conceded the first two elements of the GAAR: the existence of a tax benefit and avoidance. The only remaining issue was whether the series of transactions was abusive.\n[39] The Tax Court ruled that the series abused subsection 55(2) and the scheme governing capital dividends: TCC Reasons at paras. 118, 120, 129\u2013132, 144. The Tax Court found that the object, spirit, and purpose of subsections 55(2), 83(2) and 89(1), collectively, is to \u201cprevent a taxpayer from using a tax-free dividend to avoid the capital gain inherent in the shares of a corporation that is attributable to an unrealized appreciation\u201d: TCC Reasons at para. 118. According to the Tax Court, the cross-redemption dividends between 3295 and 4244 were abusive because they circumvented subsection 55(2) and resulted in 3295 increasing the ACB of its shares in Holdings, even though subparagraphs 88(1)(c)(ii) and (iii) did not allow for such an increase: TCC Reasons at paras. 118, 120\u2013123, 136\u2013144.\n[40] 3295 argued that the tax plan was not abusive because alternative transactions, described in paragraph [9] above, could have been implemented and resulted in less tax liability. The Tax Court said these alternative scenarios were not valid comparisons because \u201cthey related to the sale of the [3295] shares\u201d and because \u201cit was shown that the sale of Holdings\u2019 shares was essential\u201d: TCC Reasons at para. 159.\n[41] Hence, the Tax Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the Minister\u2019s reassessment.\nIV. Issue and Standard of Review [42] The only issue is whether the series is abusive.\n[43] The standard of review for GAAR cases on appeal depends on what stage of the abuse analysis a party challenges. The abuse analysis occurs in two stages. The first is to determine the object, spirit, and purpose of the provisions at issue. This first stage is a question of law, subject to correctness review by appellate courts: Deans Knight Income Corp. v. Canada, 2023 SCC 16 at para. 78 [Deans Knight]; Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 SCC 49 at para. 50; Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54 at para. 44 [Canada Trustco]; Housen v Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 at paras. 8, 26\u201337 [Housen]. The second stage is to determine whether the transactions in issue are abusive. This inquiry is \u201cnecessarily fact intensive\u201d and is thus reviewable only for palpable and overriding error, absent an extricable error of law: Deans Knight at para. 121; Canada Trustco at para. 44; Canada v. Oxford Properties Group Inc., 2018 FCA 30 at para. 39 [Oxford Properties]; Housen at para. 10.\n[44] A trial judge\u2019s failure to consider the overall result of a series of transactions is an extricable error of law. For instance, in Oxford Properties, this Court accorded no deference to the portion of the trial judge\u2019s abuse analysis that failed to consider the overall result of the series of transactions: Oxford Properties at paras. 107\u2013113. Likewise, a trial judge\u2019s failure to consider the true, overall nature of a tax plan constitutes an error of law: Canada v. Microbjo Properties Inc., 2023 FCA 157 [Microbjo]. In Microbjo, No\u00ebl CJ explained the point as follows:\nThe Tax Court\u2019s failure to take into account the true nature of the plan amounts to an error of law. Indeed, as was explained by the Supreme Court in Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc., 1997 CanLII 385 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748, 144 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (paras. 39 and 41), a tribunal that fails to consider evidence that the law requires it to consider commits an error of law.\n(Microbjo at para. 74)\nV. Analysis [45] The Tax Court failed to consider the entire series of transactions and its overall result. This error of law led the Court to misconstrue the abuse analysis and improperly reject alternative transactions that would have confirmed that the series did not abuse subsection 55(2) or the scheme governing capital dividends.\nA. The Tax Court Misconstrued the Abuse Analysis [46] The Supreme Court and this Court have held that, to determine whether transactions forming part of a series are abusive, one must consider the \u201centire series of transactions\u201d or its \u201coverall result\u201d: Lipson et al. v. The Queen, 2009 SCC 1 at para. 34; Copthorne Holdings Ltd. v. The Queen, 2011 SCC 63 at para. 71 [Copthorne]; Canada v. Landrus, 2009 FCA 113 at paras. 66\u201367; Birchcliff Energy Ltd. v. Canada, 2019 FCA 151 at paras. 27\u201328 [Birchcliff]; Oxford Properties at paras. 106\u2013110, 118\u2013119.\n[47] Here, the series\u2019 overall result did not shortchange the Minister. Before the series, a $53.7M capital gain would have been realized if Micsau had sold its 3295 shares to Novartis. After the series, a $53M capital gain was realized and taxed. Similarly, the difference between the capital gain taxed ($53M) and the purchase price paid by Novartis ($88.5M) did not escape taxation. It is simply the use of ACB legitimately acquired: $4M in the case of 3295, and $31.5M in the case of Micsau.\n[48] Instead of considering the entire series of transactions and its overall result, the Tax Court limited its analysis to the moment in the series when 3295, through the cross-redemption capital dividend, could be said to have reduced the capital gain that it would have realized from disposing of its common shares in 4244 immediately before the dividend. However, had the Tax Court considered the entire series, it could have only concluded that the cross-redemption capital dividend did not reduce 3295\u2019s capital gain and, therefore, did not abuse subsection 55(2).\n[49] A brief hypothetical illustrates that the cross-redemption did not decrease 3295\u2019s capital gain. Technically, Novartis could have purchased the 4244 shares without the cross-redemption step at paragraph [23]. This would have transferred control of 4244 to Novartis, like the impugned series of transactions, and 3295\u2019s capital gain would have remained $53M ($57M POD minus $4M ACB). As for Micsau, it would have had no gain from the sale of its 31.5M Class D shares in 4244 because those shares\u2019 ACB was equal to their FMV. After Novartis\u2019 purchase, 4244 and 3295 could have eliminated the cross-ownership using a cross-redemption. Just as the cross-ownership did not increase the value of the drug business Novartis wanted to purchase, the cross-redemption did not decrease the value of the shares sold to Novartis.\n[50] The Minister argues that the cross-redemption capital dividend decreased 3295\u2019s capital gain by $31.5M. I disagree. The $31.5M reduction the Minister complains about does not stem from the cross-redemption; it stems from selling the first lot of shares. These shares derived their FMV and ACB from Micsau lawfully isolating $31.5M of legitimately-obtained ACB and FMV into new, separate Class D shares.\n[51] A more technically precise way of explaining the provenance of the $31.5M reduction the Minister complains about is as follows. Recall that the $88.5M of 4244 shares Novartis purchased came from two lots: the first lot was Micsau\u2019s 31.5M Class D shares, and the second lot was 3295\u2019s 57M Class D shares. The second lot, worth $57M, was properly taxed; the Minister concedes that point. The remaining contention relates to the first lot. This lot derived its $31.5M FMV and ACB from the series\u2019 first two steps, in which (1) Micsau isolated $31.5M of legitimately-obtained ACB and FMV into Class D shares, then (2) exchanged them for 4244 Class D shares, which also had $31.5M ACB and FMV. Just before the sale to Novartis, Micsau transferred these 4244 shares to 3295, and 3295 sold that lot to Novartis for $31.5M. It follows that Micsau using its high ACB explains why the first lot did not create any capital gain; this has nothing to do with the cross-redemption capital dividend.\n[52] To alleviate any doubt about the series\u2019 purpose and effect, it bears noting that instead of transferring its 4244 shares to 3295 for 3295 to sell to Novartis, Micsau could have sold its shares in 4244 directly to Novartis for $31.5M. Had Micsau done so, it would have received the $31.5M directly from Novartis, and 3295\u2019s gain would have remained $53M: Hamelin at 874. This different way of proceeding would have made it clear that the series\u2019 purpose and effect was to allow Micsau to use its high ACB, not to abusively reduce 3295\u2019s capital gain. Indeed, this purpose and effect correspond exactly to the appellant\u2019s tax planning documents: Appeal Book, Vol. 1, Tab F.5 at 829.\n[53] To conclude: the series implemented the sale of shares in a new corporation, 4244, for $88.5M. The series involved 3295 receiving $57M and being taxed on a $53M capital gain ($57M POD minus $4M ACB). The series also involved Micsau receiving $31.5M while using $31.5M of its ACB. Before the series, Micsau\u2019s 3295 shares had an ACB of $48.1M and a FMV of $101.8M, and so had an accrued gain of $53.7M. After the series, Micsau received $31.5M from 3295, Micsau\u2019s ACB and FMV in 3295 was reduced by $31.5M, and Micsau\u2019s accrued gain in those shares remained $53.7M ($16.6M ACB and $70.3M FMV). Thus, Micsau stands to be taxed on $53.7M if it sells its 3295 shares after the series.\n[54] Assessing the impugned cross-redemption capital dividend in the context of the entire series of transactions, as the Tax Court should have done, I fail to see how that transaction was abusive. I agree with 3295 that this series\u2019 overall result is consistent with the object, spirit and purpose of the capital gains regime as previously identified by this Court\u2014that is, to tax real economic gains: Triad Gestco Ltd. v. The Queen, 2012 FCA 258 at paras. 40\u201342.\nB. The Tax Court Failed to Consider the Alternative Transactions [55] By failing to consider the entire series and its overall result, the Tax Court not only misconstrued the abuse analysis but also improperly rejected alternative transactions, which would have confirmed that the series is not abusive.\n[56] Alternative transactions that a taxpayer might have carried out are considered in the course of GAAR analyses.\n[57] For instance, in some cases, the existence of a tax benefit can only be established by comparing the tax consequences of the transaction or series actually carried out with the tax consequences of an alternative transaction that might have been carried out: Canada Trustco at para. 20; Copthorne at para. 35. A perfect example is the case at bar, in which 3295 conceded the existence of a tax benefit because selling its 1.5M Holdings shares without the series would have resulted in a higher capital gain.\n[58] Similarly, courts consider alternative transactions\u2019 tax consequences when determining whether tax avoidance is abusive: Shawn D. Porter, \u201cThe Misuse and Abuse Exception: The Role of Alternative Transactions\u201d in Brian J. Arnold, ed., The General Anti-Avoidance Rule: Past, Present, and Future (Toronto: Canadian Tax Foundation, 2021) at 275\u2013286 [Porter], citing Lehigh Cement Limited v. Canada, 2010 FCA 124 at paras. 40\u201341; Birchcliff at paras. 31, 48; Mathew v. Canada, 2005 SCC 55 at para. 58. Alternative transactions are helpful in determining the object, spirit and purpose of the relevant provisions and, correspondingly, what the Act seeks to allow and prevent. As stated by Webb J.A. of this Court:\nIn my view, these alternative transactions are a relevant factor in determining whether or not there has been an abuse of the provisions of the ITA [Income Tax Act]. If the taxpayer can illustrate that there are other transactions that could have achieved the same result without triggering any tax, then, in my view, this would be a relevant consideration in determining whether or not the avoidance transaction is abusive.\n(\u2026) [T]he alternative means by which the same result could have been realized is a relevant consideration in determining whether or not the avoidance transaction was abusive.\n(Univar Holdco Canada ULC v. Canada, 2017 FCA 207 at paras. 19\u201320 [Univar])\n[59] Here, 3295 asked the Tax Court to consider the four non-abusive alternative transactions, which would have allowed Micsau to use its high ACB in 3295. As mentioned, the Tax Court decided that these alternatives were not valid comparisons because \u201cthey related to the sale of the [3295] shares\u201d and \u201cit was shown that the sale of Holdings\u2019 shares was essential\u201d with the consequence that the \u201cpurpose of the sale, the price and the business implications would have been different\u201d: TCC Reasons at paras. 159\u2013160.\n[60] The Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the sale of the shares in Holdings was essential is inconsistent with the evidence and constitutes a palpable and overriding error: the shares Novartis purchased were not those in Holdings, but those in 4244. Further, nothing in the record suggests that the sale of shares in 4244 affected the purpose of the sale or the business implications of the transaction with Novartis. Indeed, Novartis obtained a $1.5M reduction of the sale price in exchange for its agreement to purchase the 4244 shares instead of the Holdings shares. It is quite possible that the same reduction would have taken place under the alternative transactions submitted by 3295, but those were never put to Novartis.\n[61] More fundamentally, in deciding not to consider the alternative transactions, the Tax Court failed to take into account the series\u2019 overall result: Micsau used its high ACB, and a capital gain was realized, which was roughly equal to the capital gain Micsau would have realized from selling 3295 directly. In my opinion, the alternative transactions 3295 submitted are relevant because:\na)They are available under the Act. The fact that they were not presented to Novartis or that Novartis may have refused to proceed with them does not detract from the fact that the Act allowed for these transactions;\nb)They are not so remote as to be practically infeasible. The alternative transactions 3295 submitted could realistically have been carried out. Had Novartis or RoundTable agreed, carrying out these alternatives would have been relatively easy;\nc)They have a high degree of commercial and economic similarity to the series at issue: Porter at 270. The alternative transactions would have resulted in Novartis acquiring shares of a corporation whose underlying asset would be the generic drug business\u2014exactly what Novartis in fact acquired;\nd)They generate tax consequences approximately as favourable as the series at issue: The proposed alternatives would have enabled Micsau to use its ACB in the 3295 shares. This would have generated a capital gain of $53.7M\u2014roughly the same gain that 3295 realized in our case; and\ne)They are not abusive of the GAAR: Univar at para. 20; Porter at 277\u2013279. The various alternative transactions would have enabled Micsau to realize its high ACB without attracting the application of the GAAR.\n[62] Accordingly, the Tax Court erred in failing to consider the alternative transactions.\nVI. Conclusion [63] I would allow the appeal with costs in this Court and the court below, and set aside the judgment of the Tax Court. Rendering the judgment that the Tax Court should have rendered, I would allow 3295\u2019s appeal from the reassessment dated November 21, 2008, and refer the reassessment back to the Minister for reassessment on the basis that 3295 did not realize an additional capital gain of $31.5M in its 2005 taxation year.\n\"Nathalie Goyette\"\nJ.A.\n\"I agree.\nYves de Montigny C.J.\"\n\"I agree.\nGerald Heckman J.A.\"\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-201-22\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\n3295940 CANADA INC. v.

The appellants asserted in their statement of claim that the levying of such fees violates subsection 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as they only apply to \u201cnon-Canadian born\u201d individuals, and as they discriminate against such individuals on the basis of their national or ethnic origin.\n[2] In a decision reported as 2022 FC 1231, the Federal Court accepted that the appellants\u2019 statement of claim identified two groups of individuals who were required to pay the fees in question, who were thus treated differently than others. It found, however, that the basis for that differential treatment was neither an enumerated nor an analogous ground of discrimination as contemplated by section 15 of the Charter. Consequently, the Federal Court found that it was plain and obvious that a claim asserting discrimination against these groups based on the Charter was bound to fail. Accordingly, the Court struck out the appellants\u2019 statement of claim, without leave to amend.\n[3] The Federal Court also dismissed the appellants\u2019 motion to certify the action as a class proceeding, again on the basis that the statement of claim failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action.\n[4] The appellants submit that in striking their statement of claim and refusing to certify the action as a class proceeding, the Federal Court erred in law in failing to find that it was at least arguable that being \u201cnon-Canadian born\u201d could qualify as a protected ground for the purpose of subsection 15(1) of the Charter. The Court further erred, the appellants say, in denying them leave to amend their statement of claim.\n[5] The appellants also argue that the Federal Court erred in failing to render a decision with respect to the four other criteria that have to be satisfied for a proceeding to be certified as a class action, even though the Court had already found the reasonable cause of action requirement had not been met. According to the appellants, the Court\u2019s failure to address these other criteria was contrary to the principle that the Court should seek to secure the most expeditious and least expensive outcome for every case.\n[6] For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the appellants\u2019 statement of claim does not disclose a reasonable cause of action, and that the Federal Court did not err in denying leave to the appellants to amend their statement of claim. I have further found that the Court did not err in failing to consider the other four criteria for the certification of class actions. Consequently, I would dismiss the appeal.\nI. Background [7] There are two categories of fees at issue in this proceeding. The first is a $500.00 fee prescribed by subsection 303(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR\/2002-227 (IRPA Regulations). This fee is charged to foreign nationals who seek to acquire permanent resident status. The parties refer to this as the \u201cRight of Permanent Residence Fee\u201d [RPRF].\n[8] The second category of fees being challenged is that prescribed by section 32 of the Citizenship Regulations, SOR\/93-246. This is a fee of $100.00 which is to be paid \u201cfor the right to be a citizen\u201d, and is payable by the applicant at the time of making the application for citizenship, but is refunded if citizenship is not granted. The parties describe this as the \u201cRight to be a Citizen Fee\u201d [RCF].\n[9] I shall refer to the RPRF and the RCF collectively in these reasons as \u201cthe Fees\u201d.\n[10] The appellant, Michael Brink, is an immigrant who resides in Canada. On May 10, 2017, while still resident in South Africa, Mr. Brink applied to become a permanent resident of Canada. He paid the RPRF as well as an application fee for the processing of his application, and his application for permanent residence was granted on March 17, 2018. Mr. Brink came to this country in 2019.\n[11] The appellant, Fuh-Chii Yang, was born in Taiwan and came to Canada in 2015. Ms. Yang was a permanent resident of Canada when she applied for Canadian citizenship on July 13, 2019, paying the RCF and an application fee at that time. Ms. Yang became a Canadian citizen in 2021.\nII. The Appellants\u2019 Statement of Claim [12] Paragraph 15 of the statement of claim states that the appellants bring the proposed class action on their own behalf, and on behalf of a putative class described as being comprised of:\nAll individuals who were not born in Canada and between September 8, 2014 until the date of the Court\u2019s trial judgment, have paid, or would otherwise be subject to the following fees:\na. a Right of Permanent Residence Fee; and\/or\nb. a Right to be a Citizen Fee,\nexcluding those who:\nc. have received a refund of the Right of Permanent Residence Fee under subsection 303(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations; or\nd. have received a refund of the Right to be a Citizen Fee under section 33 of the Citizenship Regulations.\n[13] Paragraph 19 of the statement of claim further states that the class is comprised of \u201cindividuals born outside of Canada that are otherwise fully qualified to permanently reside in Canada, or to have the right or privilege of being a Canadian citizen, and are charged taxes that are not charged to individuals born in Canada\u201d.\n[14] While the putative class is identified as being comprised as \u201cindividuals who were not born in Canada\u201d, paragraphs 40 and 42 of the statement of claim state that the distinction created by the Fees is based upon class members\u2019 \u201cnational or ethnic origin, or country of origin\u201d.\n[15] Paragraph 45 of the statement of claim further asserts that \u201csingling out the Class Members under the guise of charging the Taxes [has] further injured their dignity, feelings, and self-respect\u201d.\n[16] The appellants submit that they were subject to fees to which individuals born in Canada are not subject. They contend that these fees are discriminatory and contrary to the constitutional guarantee of substantive equality contained in section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11. Consequently, the appellants submit that they (and other members of the class) are entitled to restitution of what they say are unconstitutional fees.\n[17] The appellants refer to both classes of fees as \u201ctaxes\u201d throughout the statement of claim, stating at paragraph 4 that the Fees are \u201cakin to \u2018head taxes\u2019\u201d. However, counsel for the appellants confirmed at the hearing that nothing turns on the appellants\u2019 use of the term \u201ctaxes\u201d in the claim, and that the term is used interchangeably with the term \u201cfees\u201d in the pleading. In particular, counsel confirmed that the appellants are not pursuing an argument that the Fees are in fact unlawful taxes, such as that advanced in Eurig Estate (Re), [1998] 2 S.C.R. 565, [1998] S.C.J. No. 72.\n[18] That said, the appellants assert that whether the Fees are characterized as a tax or a regulatory charge does not change the fact that they are discriminatory and unconstitutional.\n[19] It should be noted that the appellants do not take issue with the fact that they have to apply for permanent residency or Canadian citizenship, nor do they allege that the application fees that class members are required to pay as part of their applications for permanent residence or citizenship are discriminatory.\n[20] Canada acknowledges that it requires foreign nationals to pay the RPRF in order to acquire permanent resident status and that landed immigrants have to pay the RCF to acquire Canadian citizenship. It asserts, however, that the Fees are required in order to impose a greater share of costs on those who receive a specific benefit, thereby sharing the financial burden more equitably among those who benefit from it.\n[21] Following the resolution of certain preliminary issues, the appellants brought a motion to certify this proceeding as a class action and Canada brought its motion to strike the statement of claim. The Federal Court dealt with both motions in a single decision.\nIII. The Federal Court\u2019s Decision [22] As noted earlier, Canada\u2019s motion was successful, and the Federal Court struck out the appellants\u2019 statement of claim without leave to amend on the basis that it did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. The Court dismissed the appellants\u2019 certification motion for the same reason.\n[23] The Federal Court found that although the appellants\u2019 statement of claim stated that the groups required to pay the Fees in order to obtain permanent resident status and Canadian citizenship are treated differently than others, that distinction is not based on a prohibited ground of discrimination. As a result, the Court held that the appellants had failed to establish that their statement of claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action.\n[24] Citing this Court\u2019s decision in Wenham v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 199 at para. 29, the Federal Court recognized that its task was not to assess the odds of a cause of action ultimately succeeding. The test was, rather, \u201cwhether a cause of action has been pleaded that is not plain and obvious to fail\u201d: Wenham, above at para. 31. The appellants do not take issue with the test identified by the Federal Court, but rather with its application in this case.\n[25] The Federal Court noted that the appellants claimed that there is a distinction in the treatment accorded to those born in Canada and those born outside Canada. The question for determination was whether this equated to discrimination based on an enumerated or analogous ground for the purposes of section 15 of the Charter.\n[26] While the appellants\u2019 statement of claim alleged discrimination based on \u201cnational or ethnic origin, or country of origin\u201d, the Federal Court observed that the alleged bases for the discrimination had expanded over time. In addition to the aforementioned grounds, the appellants\u2019 memorandum of fact and law filed in support of their certification motion also asserted that the Fees create a distinction based on the analogous ground of citizenship.\n[27] The Federal Court noted that the alleged grounds of discrimination had further evolved in the appellants\u2019 oral submissions to the Court, with counsel asserting that the bases for the alleged discrimination between the two groups were the enumerated grounds of national origin or ethnic origin, and analogous grounds that included citizenship, birth, or place of birth.\n[28] The Federal Court observed that a Charter claim could only succeed if the distinction in issue was based on a proscribed ground of discrimination, whether it be an enumerated or an analogous ground. If it was not based on at least one such ground, then it was plain and obvious that the action could not succeed. The Court thus considered each of the alleged bases of distinction alleged by the appellants, and whether the distinction with respect to the Fees was based on that ground.\n[29] Dealing first with the question of \u201cnational origin\u201d, the Federal Court held that \u201cnational origin\u201d refers to the nation where a person was born, or more broadly, where that person\u2019s ancestors came from. The Court held that the distinction between the two groups\u2014those who must pay the Fees and those who are not required to pay the Fees\u2014was not based on individuals\u2019 national origin, as \u201cthere are persons in each group with a variety of national origins, and some with the same national origin\u201d.\n[30] The Court further observed that while most people born in Canada are automatically Canadian citizens, there are exceptions to this such as, for example, children born in Canada to diplomatic or consular officers of a foreign government. Such individuals would have a Canadian \u201cnational origin\u201d as they were born here, but they would nevertheless be required to pay the Fees. Similarly, children born outside Canada to parents, at least one of whom is a Canadian citizen, are automatically Canadian citizens. The \u201cnational origin\u201d of such individuals would be that of a country other than Canada, but they would not be required to pay the Fees.\n[31] From this, the Federal Court concluded that the distinction in issue in this case was not based on the class members\u2019 national origin.\n[32] The Federal Court next considered whether it was plain and obvious that the discrimination claim based on \u201cethnic origin\u201d was bound to fail. The Court noted that \u201cethnic origin\u201d refers to the ethnic or cultural origins of a person and\/or the person\u2019s ancestors, and that the ethnic origin of those born in Canada encompasses most or all of the world\u2019s cultural or ethnic origins. As such, the Court found that there was no arguable case that the distinction at issue in this case was based on the class members\u2019 ethnic origins. Indeed, the ethnic origin of those born in Canada who were not required to pay the Fees parallels the ethnic origins of those not born in Canada who may be required to pay the Fees.\n[33] Although not specifically referred to as an alleged ground of discrimination in the statement of claim, the Federal Court also considered whether \u201ccitizenship\u201d was the basis of the distinction at issue in this case. The Court observed that while it was true that Canadian citizens are not required to pay either type of fee, it was also true that not all non-Canadian citizens seeking either permanent residence or citizenship were required to pay the Fees.\n[34] Indeed, the Court observed that the IRPA Regulations exempt various categories of individuals from the RPRF, many of whom are persons born outside Canada. Such individuals include, for example, dependent children of principal applicants for permanent resident status. The Citizenship Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29, similarly exempts certain classes of non-citizen individuals from the RCF, including, for example, minor adoptees.\n[35] From this, the Federal Court concluded that the basis of the distinction between those required to pay the Fees and those who are not is not their citizenship.\n[36] Insofar as class members\u2019 \u201cplace of birth\u201d was concerned, the Federal Court found that it was plain and obvious that the claim based on place of birth could not succeed for the same reason that the claim based on national origin was bound to fail. That is, individuals subject to the Fees could have been born anywhere. Consequently, the distinction in question is not based on individuals\u2019 places of birth.\n[37] The Federal Court thus accepted that the appellants had identified two groups of individuals who were required to pay the Fees who were distinguished from another group of persons not required to pay the Fees. However, the basis for that distinction was neither an enumerated nor an analogous ground of discrimination for the purposes of section 15 of the Charter. Consequently, the Court found that it was plain and obvious that the appellants\u2019 discrimination claim was bound to fail, and it granted the Crown\u2019s motion to strike without leave to amend. The Court dismissed the appellants\u2019 motion to certify the action as a class proceeding for the same reason.\nIV. Issues [38] The primary issue raised by the appellants is whether the Federal Court erred in law in failing to find that it was at least arguable that being \u201cnon-Canadian born\u201d could qualify as an analogous protected ground for the purposes of section 15 of the Charter. The appellants further argue that the Federal Court erred in denying them leave to amend their statement of claim.\n[39] The other issue raised by the appellants is whether, having found that their statement of claim did not disclose a reasonable cause of action, the Federal Court erred in failing to render a decision with respect to the four remaining certification criteria.\nV. Standard of Review [40] Whether a pleading discloses a cause of action is primarily a question of law. The standard of appellate review of the Federal Court\u2019s decision on both the motion to strike and the first certification condition is thus that of correctness: Canada (Attorney General) v. Nasogaluak, 2023 FCA 61 at para. 21; Pioneer Corp. v. Godfrey, 2019 SCC 42 at para. 57; Canada (Attorney General) v. Jost, 2020 FCA 212 at para. 21. On this standard, this Court owes no deference to the Federal Court: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 at para. 8.\n[41] The decision whether or not to grant leave to a party to amend their statement of claim is a discretionary one. So too is the decision whether or not to address other issues raised by a case, once a determinative issue has been decided. The standard of review applicable to discretionary decisions of the Federal Court is the Housen v. Nikolaisen standard. That is, correctness for questions of law and palpable and overriding error for questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law (except where there is an extricable question of law): Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, 2016 FCA 215 at para. 79; Canada v. Preston, 2023 FCA 178 at para. 12; Michaels of Canada, ULC v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 243 at para. 2; Newbould v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FCA 106 at para. 19.\nVI. Principles Governing Motions to Strike [42] As noted earlier, the parties agree that the Federal Court properly identified the principles governing motions brought pursuant to Rule 221(1)(a) of the Federal Court Rules, SOR\/98-106 to strike statements of claim on the basis that they do not disclose a reasonable cause of action.\n[43] That is, a statement of claim should not be struck unless it is plain and obvious that the action cannot succeed, assuming the facts pleaded in the statement of claim to be true: Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959, [1990] S.C.J. No. 93 at 980; Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd. v. Microsoft Corporation, 2013 SCC 57 at para. 63. In other words, the claim must have no reasonable prospect of success: R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42 at para. 17.\n[44] The onus is on the party who seeks to establish that a pleading fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action: La Rose v. Canada, 2023 FCA 241 at para. 19; Edell v. Canada, 2010 FCA 26 at para. 5. The threshold that a plaintiff must meet to establish that a claim discloses a reasonable cause of action is a low one: Brake v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 274 at para. 70.\n[45] Pleadings must, moreover, be read generously, in a manner that accommodates any inadequacies in the allegations that are merely the result of deficiencies in the drafting of the document: see Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441, [1985] S.C.J. No. 22 at 451.\n[46] Motions judges should not delve into the merits of a plaintiff\u2019s argument, but should, rather, consider whether the plaintiff should be precluded from advancing the argument at all: Salna v. Voltage Pictures, LLC, 2021 FCA 176 at para. 77. Recognizing that the law is not static, motions judges must also err on the side of permitting novel, but arguable claims to proceed to trial: R. v. Imperial Tobacco, above at paras. 19-25; Mohr v. National Hockey League, 2022 FCA 145 at para. 48, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 40426 (20 April 2023).\n[47] That said, it must also be recognized that there is a cost to access to justice in allowing cases that have no substance to proceed. The diversion of scarce judicial resources to such cases diverts time away from potentially meritorious cases that require attention: Mohr, above at para. 50; Coote v. Lawyers\u2019 Professional Indemnity Company, 2013 FCA 143 at para. 13.\n[48] Insofar as the appellants\u2019 certification motion is concerned, Rule 334.16(1) of the Federal Courts Rules identifies five conditions that must be satisfied for a proceeding in the Federal Court to be certified as a class proceeding. The first of these requires that the pleadings disclose a reasonable cause of action. This condition is assessed on the same standard that applies on a motion to strike out a pleading: Pro-Sys, above at para. 63; Salna, above at para. 72; Atlantic Lottery Corp. Inc. v. Babstock, 2020 SCC 19 at para. 14; Nasogaluak, above at para. 18.\n[49] To fail at this stage of the test the claim must be \u201cbereft of any possibility of success\u201d: Wenham, above at para. 33, citing Canada (National Revenue) v. JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc., 2013 FCA 250 at para. 47.\n[50] As is the case with motions to strike, there is a heavy burden on a defendant trying to defeat a certification motion on the ground that the statement of claim fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action. Indeed, the burden resting on a defendant in such cases has been described by this Court as \u201conerous\u201d: Nasogaluak, above at para. 19; Canada v. Greenwood, 2021 FCA 186 at para. 144, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 39885 (17 March 2022).\nVII. Principles of Pleading [51] Before considering whether the appellants\u2019 statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action, it is important to first have regard to the requirements of pleading.\n[52] Rule 174 of the Federal Courts Rules provides that \u201c[e]very pleading shall contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the party relies...\u201d. Rule 181(1) further requires that pleadings \u201ccontain particulars of every allegation contained therein \u2026\u201d.\n[53] As this Court observed in Mancuso v. Canada (National Health and Welfare), 2015 FCA 227, \u201c[i]t is fundamental to the trial process that plaintiffs plead material facts in sufficient detail to support the claim and relief sought\u201d. This is because pleadings play an important role in providing notice, and in defining the issues to be tried: at para. 16.\n[54] Not only is the proper pleading of a statement of claim necessary for a defendant to prepare a statement of defence, the material facts will also establish the parameters of relevancy of evidence at discovery and trial: Mancuso, above at para. 17. In addition, the nature of the facts pleaded allows counsel to advise their clients, prepare their case and map a trial strategy. The Court and the opposing parties should thus not be left to speculate as to how the facts might be arranged to support various causes of action.\n[55] A statement of claim must plead each constituent element of every cause of action with sufficient particularity, and each allegation must be supported by material facts. The bald assertion of conclusions does not constitute the pleading of material facts: Mancuso, above at para. 27; Canadian Olympic Association v. USA Hockey, Inc. (1997), 74 C.P.R. (3d) 348, 72 A.C.W.S. (3d) 346 (F.C.T.D.). Indeed, if the Court were to \u201c[allow] parties to plead bald allegations of fact or mere conclusory statements of law, the pleadings would fail to perform their role in identifying the issues\u201d: Mancuso, above at para. 17.\n[56] What will constitute a material fact in a statement of claim in a given case is to be determined in light of the causes of action asserted and the damages sought. Plaintiffs must plead\u2014in summary form but with sufficient detail\u2014the constituent elements of each cause of action or legal ground raised. The pleading must tell the defendant the \u201cwho, when, where, how and what\u201d of the actions that allegedly give rise to its liability: Mancuso, above at para. 19.\n[57] An assessment of the sufficiency of the material facts pleaded in a statement of claim is contextual and fact-driven. There is no bright line between material facts and bald allegations, nor is there a bright line between the pleading of material facts and the prohibition on the pleading of evidence. They are, rather, points on a continuum. It is the responsibility of a motions judge, \u201clooking at the pleadings as a whole, to ensure that the pleadings define the issues with sufficient precision to make the pre-trial and trial proceedings both manageable and fair\u201d: Mancuso, above at para. 18.\n[58] Plaintiffs can neither file inadequate pleadings and rely on defendants to request particulars, nor supplement insufficient pleadings to make them sufficient through particulars: Mancuso, above at para. 20; AstraZeneca Canada Inc. v. Novopharm Limited, 2010 FCA 112.\n[59] This Court has confirmed that there are no separate rules of pleadings for Charter cases, and that the requirement of material facts applies to pleadings of Charter infringement in the same way that it does with respect to causes of action rooted in the common law. The substantive content of each Charter right\u2014including claims under section 15 of the Charter\u2014has been clearly defined by decisions of the Supreme Court, and plaintiffs must plead sufficient material facts to satisfy the criteria applicable to the provision in question. This is not a technicality, but is rather essential to the proper presentation of Charter issues: Mancuso, above at paras. 21, 25; MacKay v. Manitoba, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357, [1989] S.C.J. No. 88 at 361-367.\n[60] The normal rules of pleading similarly apply with equal force to proposed class proceedings. Indeed, the launching of a proposed class action is a serious matter, as it potentially affects the rights of many class members as well as the interests of defendants. Compliance with the requirements of the Rules is consequently not a trifling or optional matter; it is both mandatory and essential: Merchant Law Group v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2010 FCA 184 at para. 40.\n[61] With this understanding of the requirements for pleading a claim such as this, I turn next to consider the appellants\u2019 arguments as to the errors allegedly committed by the Federal Court in determining that their statement of claim should be struck for failing to disclose a reasonable cause of action.\nVIII. The Appellants\u2019 Section 15 Arguments [62] Subsection 15(1) of the Charter states that \u201c[e]very individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability\u201d.\n[63] The protections afforded by section 15 of the Charter are not limited to the grounds expressly referred to in the provision itself (the \u201cenumerated grounds\u201d). They also extend to certain grounds not specifically mentioned in the section, known as the \u201canalogous grounds\u201d. Analogous grounds are often the bases for stereotypical decisions made not on the basis of merit, but on the basis of personal characteristics that are immutable or constructively immutable, being changeable only at unacceptable cost to personal identity: Corbiere v. Canada (Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 203, 173 D.L.R. (4th) 1 at para.13.\n[64] To establish a violation of subsection 15(1) of the Charter, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the impugned law or state action:\ncreates a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds, on its face or in its impact, and\nimposes a burden or denies a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage: R. v. Sharma, 2022 SCC 39 at para. 28; Fraser v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 SCC 28 at para. 27.\n[65] A claimant must first establish that the differential treatment to which he or she claims to have been subjected is based on either an enumerated or an analogous ground within the scope of section 15.\n[66] In addition to being victims of discrimination based on their national or ethnic origins, the appellants contend that class members are subject to discrimination based on their \u201cplaces of birth\u201d and the fact that they were born outside of Canada. They further submit that class members form the type of discrete and insular minority that warrants protection under section 15 of the Charter.\n[67] The first question for consideration is thus whether the appellants\u2019 section 15 claim as pleaded in their statement of claim is based on an enumerated or analogous ground.\nA. Is the Appellants\u2019 Section 15 Claim Based on an Enumerated or Analogous Ground? [68] I agree with Canada that the alleged grounds of discrimination in this case have been something of a moving target. The appellants assert that the differential treatment allegedly at issue in this case was based on the fact that members of the putative class were \u201cnon-Canadian born\u201d. This, the appellants say, resulted in discrimination based on class members\u2019 national origin, ethnic origin, and\/or their country of origin.\n[69] As noted earlier, \u201ccitizenship\u201d was not alleged as a basis for the differential treatment in the statement of claim, but was raised as a ground of discrimination in the memorandum of fact and law filed by the appellants in support of their certification motion. The proscribed grounds of discrimination alleged by the appellants further evolved in their oral argument before the Federal Court, when they alleged that the distinction in issue was based on class members\u2019 \u201cplace of birth\u201d or simply their \u201cbirth\u201d.\n[70] That said, the appellants have acknowledged that their \u201cprimary complaint of discrimination\u201d relates to the place of birth of class members being outside of Canada.\n[71] I will consider citizenship as a possible arguable ground for the appellants\u2019 section 15 claim later in these reasons. In the meantime, I will confine my analysis to the grounds of alleged discrimination that were specifically identified in the appellants\u2019 statement of claim, namely discrimination based on class members\u2019 national origin, ethnic origin, and\/or their country of origin, including their country of birth.\n[72] In assessing whether a statement of claim should be struck, the Court must look at the claim as it has been drafted, not how it might be drafted: Merchant Law Group, above at para. 40.\n[73] The appellants argue that the Federal Court erred in striking their statement of claim by failing to find that it was at least arguable that their claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action based on their places of birth. In support of this contention, they cite the decisions of the Federal Court and this Court in Veffer v. Canada (Minister of Foreign Affairs), 2006 FC 540 (Veffer FC), aff\u2019d 2007 FCA 247 (Veffer FCA), leave to appeal to SCC refused, 32260 (14 February 2008). These decisions held that an individual\u2019s place of birth is immutable, and that it thus qualifies as an analogous ground for the purpose of section 15 of the Charter.\n[74] The appellants further observe that once recognized, an analogous ground always stands as a constant marker of potential legislative discrimination: Corbiere, above at para. 10; Fraser, above at para. 183. Consequently, the appellants say that the Federal Court erred in failing to find that they had an arguable case based upon class members\u2019 places of birth.\n[75] The appellants note that the threshold that they had to meet to establish that their statement of claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action was a low one, submitting that it was not \u201cplain and obvious\u201d that an individual being non-Canadian born could not be protected from discrimination under section 15 of the Charter. According to the appellants, the Veffer decisions are \u201ca complete answer\u201d to the first step of the two-part section 15 analysis, and their statement of claim thus raises an arguable case that the imposition of the Fees draws a distinction between class members and others based on the analogous ground of \u201cplace of birth\u201d.\n[76] The appellants further assert that they brought the Veffer decisions to the attention of the Federal Court in their written submissions, but that the Court failed to address them in its decision.\n[77] The facts of Veffer are instructive. Mr. Veffer is a Canadian citizen who was born in Jerusalem. He applied for a Canadian passport, indicating in his application form that his place of birth was \u201cJerusalem, Israel\u201d, asking that it be recorded as such in his passport. The Government of Canada denied his request based on a policy that required that the place of birth designation for individuals born in Jerusalem be indicated simply as \u201cJerusalem\u201d in their Canadian passports, and not \u201cJerusalem, Israel\u201d.\n[78] Mr. Veffer sought judicial review of this decision, alleging that the Government\u2019s policy regarding place of birth descriptions in passports violated his right to freedom of religion under subsection 2(a) of the Charter and his section 15 equality rights, based on his religion and his place of birth.\n[79] The Federal Court held that the Government\u2019s passport policy drew a formal distinction between Mr. Veffer and others, based on his place of birth. The Court further found that Canadian passport applicants born in Jerusalem were treated differently from other passport applicants born outside Canada: Veffer FC, above at para. 34. The Federal Court went on, however, to determine that such a distinction was not discriminatory.\n[80] In Veffer FCA, the parties agreed that \u201cplace of birth\u201d was a ground analogous to those enumerated in subsection 15(1) of the Charter, as it met the criteria laid out in Corbiere, namely that it was an innate, immutable characteristic that was not alterable by conscious action: Veffer FCA, above at para. 56. This Court nevertheless dismissed Mr. Veffer\u2019s appeal. In so doing, this Court observed that not every distinction created by legislation will be discriminatory, and that a reasonable person would not conclude that the passport policy invaded Mr. Veffer\u2019s human dignity: at paras. 58, 72.\n[81] The appellants here argue that to establish that their statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action all they need is an opening to advance a novel claim. They say that this Court\u2019s decision in Veffer provides that opening, and that accordingly this case should be allowed to go to trial.\n[82] It is important to recognize, however, that the alleged discrimination at issue in Veffer was based upon the claimant having a particular place of birth\u2014that is, his having been born in the city of Jerusalem. Both Courts accepted that Mr. Veffer (and others born in Jerusalem) were treated differently than other passport applicants, because of the particular place where they were born.\n[83] That is not the situation here. Members of the putative class are not a discrete and insular minority, as was the case in Veffer. Indeed, they are a diffuse and disparate group. Class members are not subject to the Fees because they were born in a specific country, as the Fees apply regardless of class members\u2019 country of origin and the legislation imposing the Fees draws no distinction with respect to applicants\u2019 places of birth. Class members are subject to the Fees because they seek permanent residency in Canada or Canadian citizenship, regardless of where they were born.\n[84] The appellants contend that they do not need to show that every class member is potentially subject to the Fees, as the Supreme Court has held that \u201cpartial discrimination\u201d is no less discriminatory than discrimination occurring in situations in which all members of a protected group are affected: Fraser, above at para. 72. That said, it bears noting that, as the Federal Court observed in this case, some individuals may be subject to the Fees, even though they were born in Canada.\n[85] The distinction between having a particular place of birth and being born outside Canada writ large illustrates the flaw in the appellants\u2019 \u201chead tax\u201d analogy.\n[86] As noted earlier, the appellants characterize the Fees as being \u201cakin to \u2018head taxes\u2019\u201d in their statement of claim. In so doing, they attempt to draw an analogy between the Fees at issue in this case and the shameful practice in Canada\u2019s past where migrants from China (and no other country) were required to pay a monetary amount in order to come to Canada. This was known as a \u201chead tax\u201d.\n[87] What was particularly offensive about the head tax was the singling out of would-be immigrants from one country. Not only was the policy racist in origin, it perpetuated negative stereotyping of Chinese individuals and clearly communicated to them (and others) that they were less worthy of being admitted to Canada and less welcome in this country than would-be immigrants from other countries.\n[88] A more apt analogy to a head tax could arise if RPRF and RCF fees were only charged to people born in Germany or Somalia or Vietnam who were seeking permanent residence in Canada or Canadian citizenship: Canadian Doctors for Refugee Care v. Canada (Attorney General), 2014 FC 651 at para. 765.\n[89] That is not, however, what we are dealing with here. The Fees are payable by anyone\u2014whatever their national origin, ethnic origin or place of birth\u2014who seeks permanent residence in Canada or Canadian citizenship. Veffer is thus distinguishable from the present case, and this Court\u2019s comments in Veffer FCA with respect to \u201cplace of birth\u201d being an analogous ground have to be read in this context.\n[90] This distinction was recognized by this Court in Pawar v. Canada (1999), 247 N.R. 271, [1999] F.C.J. No. 1421 (F.C.A.). Pawar involved a section 15 Charter challenge to the residency requirement of the Old Age Security Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. O-9 brought by individuals who were born abroad. In upholding the Federal Court\u2019s decision dismissing the action by way of summary judgment, this Court held that \u201cbeing born abroad\u201d was not embraced by the concept of \u201cnational and ethnic origin\u201d, and that it was neither an enumerated nor an analogous ground under section 15 of the Charter: at para. 2.\n[91] This Court observed that the distinction at issue in Pawar was based on class members\u2019 prior residency in countries without reciprocal pension agreements with Canada, and that it had nothing to do with the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cnational or ethnic origin\u201d. In other words, the distinction at issue in Pawar was not based on the particular country where class members had previously resided, but rather on whether those countries had entered into reciprocal pension agreements with Canada: para. 2.\n[92] More importantly for our purposes, this Court further held in Pawar that \u201cpeople born abroad\u201d \u201cdo not form a discrete and insular group who have suffered historical disadvantage because of immutable personal characteristics or vulnerability to political and social prejudice\u201d: at para. 3.\n[93] The appellants point to the brevity of this Court\u2019s reasons in Pawar, suggesting that the decision may not have been fully considered, and that this should limit the decision\u2019s persuasive effect. While it is true that the decision is only five paragraphs in length, this Court started its reasons by acknowledging the \u201cgreat significance of the case\u201d: at para. 1. The Court went on to state that it had arrived at its decision only \u201c[a]fter having long considered and studied the written representations of counsel and listened carefully to their oral arguments\u201d: at para. 2. The panel thus clearly understood the importance of the case, and considered it carefully.\n[94] Perhaps more importantly, the decision of the Federal Court under consideration was substantial, detailed and carefully considered: Pawar v. Canada, [1998] F.C.J. 1418, [1999] 1 F.C. 158. This Court agreed with that decision, finding it unnecessary to repeat the Federal Court\u2019s analysis: at para. 4. That does not mean that this Court did not carefully consider the case. It also bears noting that the Supreme Court of Canada subsequently denied leave to the class members in Pawar to appeal this Court\u2019s decision: [1999] S.C.C.A. No. 526, 27578 (8 June 2000).\n[95] A differently constituted panel of this Court subsequently came to the same conclusion as the Court did in Pawar: Shergill v. Canada, 2003 FCA 468, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 30177 (13 May 2004).\n[96] In accordance with doctrine of vertical stare decisis, this Court\u2019s decision in Pawar was binding on the Federal Court. Even though the Federal Court did not mention Pawar in its analysis, the Court was nevertheless bound to find that that \u201cbeing born abroad\u201d was not an analogous ground for the purpose of section 15 of the Charter, nor was it subsumed within the enumerated grounds of national or ethnic origin. As a result, it was plain and obvious that the appellants\u2019 claim could not succeed.\n[97] Stare decisis also has a horizontal aspect, which provides that decisions from the same court should be followed unless there is a compelling reason not to do so: R. v. Sullivan, 2022 SCC 19 at paras. 74-79; Janssen Inc. v. Canada (Minister of Health), 2021 FCA 137 at para. 72.\n[98] Indeed, as this Court observed in Miller v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 FCA 370, while it is open to this Court to overrule its prior decisions, \u201cthe values of certainty and consistency lie close to the heart of the orderly administration of justice in a system of law and government based on the rule of law\u201d: at para. 8. As a result, one panel of this Court ought not to come to a different conclusion from a different panel, even if it were the view that the first decision was wrongly decided: Miller, above at para. 8.\n[99] The appellants have not provided a compelling reason that would justify departing from this Court\u2019s decision in Pawar. This Court is thus required to conclude that individuals\u2019 place of birth outside of Canada is not embraced by the concept of \u201cnational and ethnic origin\u201d, and that \u201cbeing born abroad\u201d is not an analogous ground under section 15 of the Charter.\n[100] As noted above, class members are subject to the Fees because they are seeking permanent residency in Canada or Canadian citizenship. Their need to do so is a function of their immigration status rather than their place of birth or their national or ethnic origin. This does not assist the appellants, however, as this Court has rejected \u201cimmigration status\u201d as an analogous ground on the basis that it is not a personal characteristic that is immutable or changeable only at great personal cost: Almadhoun v. Canada, 2018 FCA 112 at para. 28. See also Forrest v. Canada (Attorney General), 2006 FCA 400 at para. 16; Toussaint v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FCA 213 at para. 99.\n[101] As noted earlier, the first part of the two-part test for assessing section 15 claims requires claimants to demonstrate that the impugned law or state action creates a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds, on its face or in its impact. As explained above, none of the grounds currently identified in the appellants\u2019 statement of claim constitute enumerated or analogous grounds in the circumstances of their claim.\n[102] It is thus plain and obvious that, to the extent that the appellants\u2019 claim is based on their places of birth being outside of Canada, their national or ethnic origin or their country of origin, it could not succeed, as it did not engage any of the enumerated or analogous grounds protected by subsection 15(1) of the Charter. The Federal Court thus did not err in striking the appellants\u2019 statement of claim on that basis.\n[103] This argument was the primary focus of the appellants\u2019 appeal. To the extent that the appellants raised other issues regarding the viability of their section 15 claim, these arguments will be addressed in the next section of these reasons.\nB. Other Arguments Advanced by the Appellants [104] Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Fraser, above at paragraphs 117 and 120, the appellants contend that an evidentiary record may be required in order for a court to recognize a new analogous ground. Consequently, the appellants say that the Federal Court erred in striking their claim at this stage of the proceeding, thereby denying them the opportunity to lead the necessary evidence to establish that the discrimination at issue in this case was based on an analogous ground.\n[105] It is important to note that the basis for the alleged discrimination at issue in Fraser was family\/parental status, and the Court was being asked to recognize such status as a new analogous ground for the purposes of section 15 of the Charter: at para. 116. While \u201cfamily status\u201d is a protected ground in the federal and most provincial human rights statutes, the Supreme Court had not previously considered whether family\/parental status constituted an analogous ground in the Charter context. As a result, the Court was understandably concerned about recognizing a new analogous ground, in the absence of evidence as to the possible impact that such recognition could have: Fraser, above at para. 120. That is not what we are faced with here.\n[106] As the appellants acknowledge at paragraph 29 of their memorandum of fact and law, whether an alleged ground of discrimination is an enumerated or analogous ground is a legal question. Unlike the situation that the Supreme Court faced in Fraser, the asserted grounds of discrimination at issue in this case have all been judicially considered in the Charter context, including the allegedly analogous grounds of \u201cplace of birth\u201d or \u201cbeing born outside of Canada\u201d.\n[107] The appellants also cite the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Sharma, above, where the Court stated that indirect discrimination may require evidence to be adduced at trial, evidence that could not be made available to the Federal Court on a motion to strike: at paras. 42-44, 49. Assuming for the sake of argument that the alleged discrimination at issue in this case is indeed indirect discrimination (something about which I express no opinion), evidence would undoubtedly be required to demonstrate that the impugned actions actually have a differential impact on a protected group.\n[108] However, whether the affected individuals are in fact members of a protected group such that section 15 of the Charter is engaged on the facts, as pleaded, is a legal question.\n[109] As a consequence, I do not accept the appellants\u2019 contention that they should be given the opportunity to lead evidence at trial to demonstrate that their statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action based on section 15 of the Charter.\n[110] I would also observe that Rule 221(2) of the Federal Courts Rules specifically precludes the use of evidence on a motion to strike a pleading under Rule 221(1)(a) for failing to disclose a reasonable cause of action. This is because the defect in the pleading must be apparent on its face. In this case, it is clear from the jurisprudence discussed above that, as currently pleaded, it is plain and obvious that the appellants\u2019 claim is bereft of any chance of success.\n[111] There are other defects in the appellants\u2019 statement of claim.\n[112] The appellants did not plead sufficient material facts to satisfy the second part of the section 15 Charter test. That is, the requirement that the Fees impose a burden on class members in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating a disadvantage. The appellants also failed to plead sufficient material facts capable of demonstrating that the Fees limited their access to permanent residence or citizenship in a discriminatory manner. Their statement of claim contains a set of conclusions, but does not provide any material facts supporting those conclusions.\n[113] The appellants have also not alleged that the Fees target individuals born abroad in an exclusionary way, or in a way that deprives them of their self-worth or livelihood, or that any proposed class members were impacted in this way. They baldly assert that class members are singled out by the Fees and that their \u201cdignity, feelings and self-respect are injured\u201d, but they provide no material facts in this regard, nor have they alleged that the Fees perpetuate a view that those who have to pay them have less value as members of society.\n[114] It is, therefore, plain and obvious that, as pleaded, the appellants\u2019 claim would also be bound to fail at the second stage of the section 15 analysis.\n[115] Finally, after the hearing of this appeal, the parties drew the Court\u2019s attention to the recent decision of the Ontario Superior Court in Bjorkquist et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, 2023 ONSC 7152.\n[116] The appellants say that Bjorkquist is relevant to this appeal in that it recognizes that being born outside of Canada (regardless of the country) is covered by the enumerated ground of \u201cnational origin\u201d under section 15 of the Charter. The Court further found that the enumerated ground of \u201cnational origin\u201d includes \u201ccountry of birth\u201d, and that the plain reading of section 15 would cover not only birth in a particular country but also \u201cwhether one was born in Canada or in a different country\u201d: at para. 77.\n[117] The Crown observes that Bjorkquist does not address either the sufficiency of pleadings issue or the requirement to plead material facts, in particular. The Crown further submits that the case may or may not be relevant to this appeal, and that, in any event, the decision is both distinguishable and incorrect. I agree.\n[118] Bjorkquist involved a challenge to paragraph 3(3)(a) of the Citizenship Act, which provides that Canadian citizens born abroad are precluded from passing their Canadian citizenship on to their children automatically, if those children were also born abroad. This was known as the \u201csecond-generation cut-off\u201d. Canadians born outside Canada who obtain their citizenship by descent from their Canadian-born parents are treated differently in this regard than Canadians born in Canada and naturalized Canadians, who are entitled to pass their citizenship on to their children, regardless of where those children may be born.\n[119] Amongst other things, the applicants argued that the second-generation cut-off violated section 15 of the Charter, based on their national origin.\n[120] In Bjorkquist, the Court relied on my decision in Canadian Doctors for Refugee Care, above, where I held that the term \u201cnational origin\u201d is broad enough to include people who are born in a particular country, as well as people who come from a particular country: at para. 767. The Court went on in Bjorkquist to find that if discrimination based on country of birth is protected under section 15 of the Charter, it must also protect against discrimination based on whether one was born in Canada or in a different country: at para. 77.\n[121] The Court thus found that the distinction at issue in Bjorkquist was based on the national origin of the claimants, in that it treats those individuals who became Canadians at birth because they were born in Canada differently from those Canadians who obtained their citizenship by descent upon their birth outside of Canada. This latter group holds a lesser class of citizenship because, unlike Canadian-born citizens, they are unable to pass on Canadian citizenship by descent to their children born abroad: Bjorkquist, above at para. 85.\n[122] It is, however, important to understand the context in which my comments in Canadian Doctors were made. At issue in that case was governmental action that reduced the level of healthcare insurance coverage available to refugees and others claiming the protection of Canada, if those individuals came from certain specified countries known as \u201cdesignated countries of origin\u201d. Such individuals received fewer healthcare benefits than refugees and others from non-designated countries of origin.\n[123] In concluding that the government\u2019s actions violated section 15 of the Charter, I found that limiting the healthcare insurance coverage available to such individuals denied them the equal benefit of the law, and conveyed the message that these individuals\u2019 lives were less worthy and that they were less welcome in Canada.\n[124] This is consistent with my earlier comments in this case with respect to the discriminatory nature of the \u201chead tax\u201d that singled out individuals from one country for adverse differential treatment. It is also consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in Veffer FCA, where individuals born in one place\u2014the city of Jerusalem\u2014were treated differently than other applicants for Canadian passports whose passports would signify their country of their birth.\n[125] However, unlike the situation in Bjorkquist, where the differential treatment applied only to individuals born outside Canada, the Fees at issue in this case are payable by anyone\u2014wherever they were born (including in Canada)\u2014who applies for permanent residency or Canadian citizenship. The legislation does not differentiate between applicants born in Canada and those born outside of Canada, and the appellants have not argued that the law has a differential impact on applicants born outside Canada relative to those who were born in this country.\n[126] The facts in Bjorkquist are thus distinguishable from those of the present case. Moreover, to the extent that the Superior Court\u2019s ruling in Bjorkquist is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s holding in Pawar that \u201cbeing born abroad\u201d is not an analogous ground for the purposes of section 15 of the Charter, Pawar governs this case.\n[127] The final issue for determination with respect to this ground of appeal is whether the Federal Court erred in refusing to grant leave to the appellants to amend their statement of claim. This question will be considered next.\nIX. Did the Federal Court Err in Refusing to Grant Leave to Amend the Statement of Claim? [128] As noted earlier, having rejected all of the alleged grounds of discrimination raised by the appellants in their statement of claim and in their written or oral arguments, the Federal Court struck out their statement of claim, without leave to amend. In so doing, the Federal Court did not distinguish between the grounds of discrimination that were specifically pleaded in the appellants\u2019 statement of claim and those that were merely the subject of argument, in particular, that of \u201ccitizenship\u201d.\n[129] Insofar as the alleged discrimination based on citizenship was concerned, the Federal Court observed that while Canadian citizens are not required to pay either type of fee, there are applicants for permanent residence who are not Canadian citizens who also do not have to pay the RPRF. These include individuals born outside Canada such as dependent children and a range of family members of persons sponsoring permanent resident applications. There are also several categories of individuals who are exempt from paying the RCF, including minors applying as adults, minors being granted citizenship and minor adoptees.\n[130] From this, the Federal Court concluded that the basis of the distinction between those required to pay the Fees and those who are not required to do so is not citizenship.\n[131] The appellants submit that they have an arguable case that the Fees discriminate against class members based upon their citizenship. Consequently, the appellants say that if this Court were to decide that the claim, as currently drafted, does not disclose a reasonable cause of action, the Court should nevertheless grant them leave to amend their claim to plead discrimination based on citizenship, and to remedy any deficiencies that the Court may otherwise identify in their statement of claim.\n[132] The decision as to whether or not a party should be granted leave to amend their pleading is a discretionary one. As noted earlier, the standard of review applicable to discretionary orders of the Federal Court is the Housen v. Nikolaisen standard.\n[133] Leave to amend a statement of claim in a proposed class proceeding should only be denied in the clearest cases. That is, where it is plain and obvious that no tenable cause of action is possible on the facts as alleged, and there is no reason to suppose that the party could improve his or her case by an amendment: Jost, above at para. 49.\n[134] It is true that citizenship has been recognized as an analogous ground for the purpose of section 15 of the Charter on the basis that it is, at least temporarily, a personal characteristic that is not alterable by conscious action, and in some cases is not alterable except on the basis of unacceptable cost: Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143, [1989] S.C.J. No. 6 at 151, 158; Lavoie v. Canada, 2002 SCC 23 at paras. 2, 39. However, as was noted earlier, class members are subject to the Fees because they are individuals who are actively seeking to change their legal status. This relates to their immigration status rather than their place of birth or their national or ethnic origin, or, indeed, their citizenship.\n[135] The Supreme Court of Canada has further observed that it is \u201cthe most fundamental principle of immigration law\u201d that non-citizens do not have an unqualified right to enter or remain in Canada: Chiarelli v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 711, 90 D.L.R. (4th) 289 at 733. The Court further observed in Chiarelli that Parliament has the right to adopt an immigration policy, and to enact legislation prescribing the conditions under which non-citizens will be permitted to enter and remain in Canada: at para. 24. Requiring that applicants who wish to immigrate to Canada or become Canadian citizens pay certain fees is within this domain of policy making, as long as such individuals are not targeted in a discriminatory fashion. As explained above, the appellants are subject to the Fees because of their immigration status and not their citizenship, which is neither an enumerated nor an analogous ground.\n[136] Consequently, it is plain and obvious that no reasonable cause of action based on section 15 is possible based on citizenship, and the Federal Court did not err in denying the appellants leave to amend their statement of claim.\nX. The Federal Court\u2019s Failure to Address the Other Four Certification Criteria [137] A motion to certify an action as a class proceeding in the Federal Courts is governed by Rule 334.16(1) of the Federal Courts Rules. This Rule states that a judge shall certify a proceeding as a class proceeding if the following five requirements are met:\nthe pleadings disclose a reasonable cause of action;\nthere is an identifiable class of two or more persons;\nthe claims of the class members raise common questions of law or fact (whether or not those common questions predominate over questions affecting only individual members);\na class proceeding is the preferable procedure for the just and efficient resolution of the common questions of law or fact; and\nthere is a representative plaintiff or applicant who would fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.\n[138] This list is conjunctive: that is, the Court must be satisfied that all five requirements are satisfied in a given case before the Court can certify an action as a class proceeding: Buffalo v. Samson First Nation, 2008 FC 1308 at para. 35, aff\u2019d 2010 FCA 165 at para. 3.\n[139] As discussed earlier, the Federal Court found that the appellants\u2019 statement of claim in this case did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. Consequently, the first of the five certification criteria was not satisfied, and it followed that the appellants\u2019 certification motion must necessarily fail.\n[140] Having found that the first of the certification criteria had not been satisfied in this case, it was entirely open to the Federal Court to determine that it was unnecessary to consider the remaining four certification criteria. Given that all of the certification requirements had to be satisfied before the action could be certified as a class proceeding, there was nothing that the Federal Court could decide with respect to the four remaining criteria that could have affected the outcome of the certification motion.\n[141] That is, the existence of, for example, important common questions of law or a strong litigation plan could not make up for the lack of a reasonable cause of action in the certification process: Bou Malhab v. Diffusion M\u00e9trom\u00e9dia CMR inc., 2011 SCC 9 at para. 52.\n[142] Whether or not to address the remaining outstanding issues in such circumstances was a matter wholly within the discretion of the motions judge. As noted earlier, this Court should not interfere with discretionary decisions of the Federal Court absent an error of law or a palpable and overriding error on a question of fact or of mixed fact and law, and the appellants have not identified a reviewable error in the Federal Court\u2019s exercise of discretion in this regard.\nXI. Proposed Disposition [143] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal. In accordance with Rule 334.39 I would not order costs with respect to the appellants\u2019 certification motion, and in the exercise of my discretion, I would make no order as to costs in relation to Canada\u2019s motion to strike.\n\u201cAnne L.

Zinn, the Infringement Decision) which found that the respondent, Sonos Inc. (Sonos), did not infringe claim 7 of Google\u2019s Canadian Patent No. 2,545,150 (the 150 Patent). Google also appeals a subsequent Order of Justice Zinn dated September 1, 2022, which ordered Google to pay Sonos\u2019 costs (the Costs Decision).\n[2] Google argues that the Federal Court erred in three respects in the Infringement Decision, two concerning the interpretation of terms used in claim 7 and the third concerning the application of another term used in claim 7 in assessing infringement. Specifically, Google takes issue with the Federal Court\u2019s interpretation of (i) \u201cecho cancellation\u201d, and (ii) \u201can order\u201d. Though Google does not take issue with the Federal Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cadaptively determine\u201d, it argues that the Federal Court erred in its application of this term in its infringement analysis. Google acknowledges that, in order to be successful in its appeal of the Infringement Decision, it must convince this Court that the Federal Court erred in respect of both (i) application of the term \u201cadaptively determine\u201d, and (ii) construction of at least one of the terms \u201cecho cancellation\u201d and \u201can order\u201d.\n[3] I would dismiss the appeal of the Infringement Decision.\n[4] The 150 Patent concerns a system for adaptive echo and noise control in electronic equipment such as smart speakers of the type marketed by Sonos. The system cancels echo and suppresses noise that might interfere with communication, such as voice commands. Echo cancellation minimizes echo caused by the sound coming from the speaker or other electronic equipment. Noise suppression improves communication in an environment with unwanted sounds. Claim 7 of the 150 Patent defines an electronic device having both an echo canceller and a noise suppressor, wherein \u201can order of echo cancellation and noise suppression\u201d is \u201cadaptively determine[d]\u201d based on \u201can amount of noise\u201d.\n[5] Before addressing the claim construction issues raised by Google, a comment on the standard of review would be helpful. The parties agree that the applicable standard of review in the present appeals is as indicated in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235: questions of law are reviewed on a standard of correctness, and questions of fact or of mixed fact and law from which no question of law is extricable are reviewed on a standard of palpable and overriding error.\n[6] The parties disagree on whether the claim construction issues are questions of law or questions of mixed fact and law. In theory, the interpretation of a patent claim, like the interpretation of a statute or a regulation, is a question of law, subject to the correctness standard: Whirlpool Corp. v. Camco Inc., 2000 SCC 67, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1067 at paras. 61, 76 (Whirlpool). However, patent claims are interpreted from the point of view of a person skilled in the art: Whirlpool at para. 48. Expert evidence is often considered in determining how such a person would have understood certain terms in a claim at the relevant date. The weighing of this evidence is a question of mixed fact and law. Therefore, where the interpretation of a patent claim turns on the weight given to expert evidence, this Court will intervene only where there is a palpable and overriding error: Biogen Canada Inc. v. Pharmascience Inc., 2022 FCA 143, 196 C.P.R. (4th) 120 at para. 38; ABB Technology AG v. Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd., 2015 FCA 181, 132 C.P.R. (4th) 405 at paras. 22\u201323.\n[7] In this case, the Federal Court found that, in the context of the 150 Patent, the term \u201cecho\u201d is distinct from, and not simply a type of, \u201cnoise\u201d. Therefore, echo cancellation and noise suppression are distinct processes. In reaching this conclusion, the Federal Court relied on expert evidence (see paragraphs 47 to 52 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons).\n[8] Google argues that the Federal Court erred by failing to address its argument that \u201cecho cancellation\u201d encompasses any mechanism to minimize echo, and is not limited to a mechanism that uses a reference signal and a cancellation point. In simpler terms, Google argues that \u201cecho cancellation\u201d is not limited to the method described in the 150 Patent: using a saved version of an outgoing signal (e.g. what the speakers are playing) to cancel its echo. Google argues that \u201cecho cancellation\u201d extends to the minimization of echo by other means. These other means treat echo as a type of noise and are essentially a type of noise suppression. Google argues that the Federal Court did not explicitly address this point; nor implicitly address the point in concluding that echo cancellation and noise suppression are distinct processes.\n[9] In my view, the Federal Court found that echo cancellation and noise suppression are distinct processes based on a conclusion that, in the context of the 150 Patent, echo is distinct from noise (see paragraphs 51 and 52 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons), and echo cancellation is distinct from echo suppression (see paragraphs 77 and 78 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons). It follows from this that the Federal Court rejected Google\u2019s argument that \u201cecho cancellation\u201d encompasses activities that are essentially noise suppression. I disagree with Google\u2019s submission that the Federal Court failed to consider this construction issue.\n[10] I find no merit in Google\u2019s argument that such a conclusion was not available to the Federal Court because it would violate a fundamental principle of claim construction\u2014i.e., giving claim 7 of the 150 Patent exactly the same scope as claim 8, which is dependent from, and should be narrower than, claim 7. Claim 8 is limited to an echo canceller with certain features. The Federal Court\u2019s interpretation of claim 7 does not limit the scope of the echo canceller defined therein to those features defined in claim 8.\n[11] With regard to the term \u201can order\u201d in the phrase \u201can order of echo cancellation and noise suppression\u201d Google argues that the Federal Court erred in failing to recognize that this term could encompass an order in which either the echo cancellation or the noise suppression was available but not performed.\n[12] The Federal Court considered this issue and weighed the conflicting expert evidence (see paragraphs 59 to 64 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons). It concluded that there is no \u201corder of echo cancellation and noise suppression\u201d where only one of those functions is performed. Google argues that nothing in the 150 Patent supports the statement at paragraph 64 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons that \u201cthe device of Claim 7 must have at least two operating states that include both noise suppression and echo cancellation\u201d. In my view, this statement is not an erroneous interpretation of claim 7. Rather, it simply recognizes that the claimed device must permit the operations of echo cancellation and noise suppression to be performed in at least two different orders. In my view, it was open to the Federal Court to favour one expert over the other and to reach the conclusion it did concerning the meaning of \u201can order\u201d.\n[13] Based on Google\u2019s acknowledgement that it must convince this Court that the Federal Court erred on at least one of the claim construction issues, the foregoing is sufficient to dismiss the appeal of the Infringement Decision. It is not necessary to consider the Federal Court\u2019s application of the term \u201cadaptively determine\u201d. It is also not necessary to consider Sonos\u2019 argument that, even if Google were successful in its arguments, there would be no infringement by Sonos.\n[14] Google\u2019s appeal of the Costs Decision depends on success in its appeal of the Infringement Decision. Accordingly, no more need be said on the appeal of the Costs Decision.\n[15] For these reasons, I would dismiss both appeals with costs. Based on the parties\u2019 agreement, I would set the amount of costs at $15,000, all-inclusive.\n\"George R.

The passages in the notice of appeal relate to the appellant\u2019s argument on the validity of the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 2, S.C. 2014, c. 39 [EAP 2014 Act]. The Tax Court\u2019s decision to allow the respondent to file its reply within 60 days of the Court\u2019s order is not being appealed.\n[2] The underlying tax appeal concerns the appellant\u2019s claim for the Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit (CPTC) and whether a contribution by Telefilm Canada was \u201cassistance\u201d for the purposes of subsection 125.4(1) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.). The EAP 2014 Act amended the definition of \u201cassistance\u201d (retroactively) and provided a basis for the Minister\u2019s reassessment of the appellant\u2019s 2011 taxation year reducing the appellant\u2019s CPTC.\n[3] The appellant filed an appeal in the Tax Court, challenging, among other things, the validity of the EAP 2014 Act. Its position was that when the EAP 2014 Act was passed, the Senate had 17 vacancies, rendering the EAP 2014 Act invalid, according to the Constitution Act, 1867 (U.K.), 30 & 31 Vict., c. 3, reprinted in R.S.C. 1985, Appendix II, No. 5. The argument is that there was insufficient representation from the provinces and territories in the Senate, the Senate was not properly constituted and thus could not validly pass legislation.\n[4] The respondent successfully moved to strike the passages in the notice of appeal relating to this argument, on the basis that it had no reasonable prospect of success.\n[5] The appellate standards of review from Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 apply to interlocutory decisions of the Tax Court: Canada v. Preston, 2023 FCA 178 at para. 12; Kinglon Investments Inc. v. Canada, 2015 FCA 134 at para. 5. These standards are correctness for questions of law, and palpable and overriding error for questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law, unless there is an extricable question of law, which is reviewable for correctness.\n[6] Here, the standard of review is correctness, as the appeal raises a question of law \u2014 the Tax Court\u2019s decision to strike the passages was based on its interpretation of sections 21, 22, and 35 of the Constitution Act, 1867.\n[7] We see no error in the Tax Court\u2019s decision requiring this Court\u2019s intervention. The Tax Court correctly stated and applied the test for striking out pleadings \u2014 whether it is \u201cplain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action\u201d: R. v. Imperial Tobacco, 2011 SCC 42 at para. 17; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Canada, 2013 FCA 122 at para. 7; TCC Reasons at paras. 27-28.\n[8] The Tax Court considered the respondent\u2019s arguments in support of its motion to strike: (a) that the Tax Court does not have jurisdiction to review whether the Senate validly passed the EAP 2014 Act, as this is within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament; and (b) the Senate vacancy argument.\n[9] The Tax Court declined to strike the relevant passages on the basis of the jurisdiction argument: TCC Reasons at paras. 30-43. In the absence of sufficient submissions from the parties, and as the Tax Court decision did not turn on this issue, we decline to address the jurisdiction issue. In doing so, we do not endorse the Tax Court\u2019s reasons. The Tax Court, in obiter, suggested that it could grant a declaration of invalidity if the appellant\u2019s argument were to succeed: TCC Reasons at paras. 62-68. For similar reasons, we decline to address this issue, and in doing so do not endorse the Tax Court\u2019s reasons.\n[10] On the Senate vacancy issue, we agree with the Tax Court\u2019s reasons: TCC Reasons at paras. 44-61. The Tax Court adopted an interpretation of sections 21, 22, and 35 of the Constitution Act, 1867 that is consistent with their text, context, and purpose. We disagree with the appellant\u2019s submissions that the Tax Court took a purely textual approach.\n[11] As the Tax Court concluded, the language of sections 21 and 22 \u2014 which concern the number of senators and the representation of provinces respectively \u2014 is \u201csubject to the Provisions of this Act\u201d: TCC Reasons at para. 46. We reject the appellant\u2019s argument that the \u201csubject to\u201d language is limited in its application to sections 26, 27 and 28 of the Constitution Act, 1867.\n[12] Crucially, section 35 makes it clear that the Senate may exercise its powers notwithstanding any vacancies, as long as there is a quorum of senators:\nQuorum of Senate\nQuorum du S\u00e9nat\n35 Until the Parliament of Canada otherwise provides, the Presence of at least Fifteen Senators, including the Speaker, shall be necessary to constitute a Meeting of the Senate for the Exercise of its Powers.\n35 Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le parlement du Canada en ordonne autrement, la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019au moins quinze s\u00e9nateurs, y compris l\u2019orateur, sera n\u00e9cessaire pour constituer une assembl\u00e9e du S\u00e9nat dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions.\n[13] Accordingly, it was plain and obvious that the appellant\u2019s Senate vacancy argument had no reasonable prospect of success: TCC Reasons at para. 61. As noted at the hearing in this Court, the untenable implication of the appellant\u2019s Senate vacancy argument is that any legislation passed by a quorum of the Senate when there are vacancies in the Senate could also be invalid.\n[14] The appellant has not established that the Tax Court erred. We will dismiss the appeal, with costs. The parties shall have 30 days to advise the Court as to their agreement on quantum or, failing agreement, to make written submissions on quantum.\n\u201cMonica Biringer\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-22-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nFU2 PRODUCTIONS LTD. v.

Overview [1] The applicant, Ms. Molchan, seeks judicial review of a decision of the Appeal Division of the Social Security Tribunal dated February 10, 2023 (2023 SST 139).\n[2] In February 2020, Ms. Molchan stopped working because of injuries caused in a car accident. As her sickness benefits were about to expire in June 2020, Ms. Molchan contacted the Canada Employment Insurance Commission to indicate that she had not yet recovered and could not return to work. Believing that she was acting on the advice of the Commission, she made a claim for regular benefits and reported that she was capable of and available for work. The Commission approved her application and she collected regular benefits for an additional 25 weeks.\n[3] On March 4, 2021, the Commission contacted Ms. Molchan to discuss her availability for work. She confirmed to the Commission that she was not capable of working during the period she collected regular benefits. When asked why she reported being capable of working, she responded that she had done so on the advice of the two Service Canada agents to whom she had explained her situation in June 2020 (Applicant\u2019s record at 161).\n[4] On March 11, 2021, the Commission retroactively reconsidered Ms. Molchan\u2019s entitlement to regular benefits and decided that she was not capable of and available for work, thereby creating an overpayment (Applicant\u2019s record at 172). Ms. Molchan sought reconsideration, but the Commission upheld its decision (Applicant\u2019s record at 183).\n[5] Ms. Molchan appealed the Commission\u2019s decision to the General Division of the Social Security Tribunal, arguing that the Commission has no authority to reconsider a decision on availability unless presented with new facts. She maintained that she had been truthful and forthcoming about her situation and availability status from the beginning and that there were no new facts to justify reconsideration of her availability. She insisted that the Service Canada agents had exercised their discretion to determine she was eligible for regular benefits and had told her to declare in her biweekly reports that she was available for work even though she was not. She further argued that the Commission had not followed its reconsideration policy, which provides that the Commission will not retroactively review decisions about availability if the Commission incorrectly paid benefits.\n[6] The General Division dismissed Ms. Molchan\u2019s appeal (2022 SST 1625). In its decision dated May 30, 2022, the General Division began by indicating that it believed Ms. Molchan had received misleading advice about how to claim benefits after her sickness benefits ended. It then held that the Commission\u2019s authority under section 52 of the Employment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996, c. 23 (EIA) to retroactively reconsider Ms. Molchan\u2019s entitlement to benefits is a discretionary decision and found that the Commission had exercised its discretion judicially. As it was uncontested that Ms. Molchan was not capable of working during the period she received benefits, the General Division concluded that Ms. Molchan had not demonstrated she was entitled to regular benefits (Applicant\u2019s record at 246-253).\n[7] The Appeal Division dismissed Ms. Molchan\u2019s appeal. It agreed with the parties that the General Division erred when it decided that the Commission only had to show that it reconsidered Ms. Molchan\u2019s claim within the statutory time limit to prove it exercised its discretion properly. The Appeal Division then substituted its decision for that of the General Division and found that the Commission had not exercised its discretion judicially because it had failed to consider relevant factors as required by the case law.\n[8] The Appeal Division subsequently examined whether discretion should be exercised to reconsider the claim. After noting several factors arguing against reconsideration, the Appeal Division found that Ms. Molchan\u2019s false statements were pivotal to the Commission\u2019s assessment of her availability for work. Noting that the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy lists false statements as one of the grounds in favour of reconsideration, the Appeal Division considered whether the policy should apply given that the Commission\u2019s agents had directed Ms. Molchan to make the false statements. After considering that a claimant cannot rely on misinformation from the Commission to be relieved of an overpayment, the Appeal Division reached the same conclusion as the Commission and maintained the overpayment.\n[9] Before this Court, Ms. Molchan submits that the Appeal Division erred in concluding, first, that the Commission could retroactively reconsider her availability in the absence of new information and, second, that she had made false statements within the meaning of the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy. In the alternative, she claims that the Appeal Division erred in concluding that the Commission had exercised its discretion judicially.\nII. Analysis A. Standard of Review [10] The parties agree that the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is reviewable on the deferential standard of reasonableness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65; Page v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 169 at para. 48; Canada (Attorney General) v. Hull, 2022 FCA 82 at paras. 12-13; Hillier v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 44 at para. 12).\n[11] When the standard of reasonableness applies, the Court\u2019s focus is on \u201cwhether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision\u201d (Vavilov at para. 99). It must be internally coherent, and display a rational chain of analysis (Vavilov at para. 85). The burden is on the party challenging the decision to show that it is unreasonable and the Court \u201cmust be satisfied that any shortcomings or flaws relied on \u2026 are sufficiently central or significant to render the decision unreasonable\u201d (Vavilov at para. 100).\n[12] One of the relevant constraints is subsection 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act, S.C. 2005, c. 34 (DESDA). The Appeal Division can only intervene if the General Division (a) failed to observe a principle of natural justice or otherwise acted beyond or refused to exercise its jurisdiction; (b) erred in law in making its decision, whether or not the error appears on the face of the record; or (c) based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it. Paragraph 58(1)(c) of the DESDA does not allow the Appeal Division to overturn a decision of the General Division on the basis that it would have weighed the evidence differently (Sibbald v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 157 at para. 27; Uvaliyev v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 222 at para. 7).\n[13] Once the Appeal Division finds there is a legitimate reason to intervene, it may proceed to decide questions of fact that are necessary for the disposition of the appeal (Nelson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 222 at para. 17) and give the decision the General Division should have given or refer the matter back for reconsideration in accordance with any directions it considers appropriate (DESDA, subsection 59(1)).\nB. Reconsideration of Ms. Molchan\u2019s claim [14] At the outset, it is useful to set out the statutory and policy framework relevant to this application.\n(1) Relevant Framework [15] Employment insurance benefits are payable to claimants who meet the statutory requirements. To receive benefits, claimants must first qualify to receive benefits. They must demonstrate that they have suffered an interruption of earnings from employment and that they have had a minimum number of hours of insurable employment in a period preceding the claim (EIA, ss. 7, 8).\n[16] Claimants must also not be disentitled to receive benefits. Pursuant to paragraph 18(1)(a) of the EIA, a claimant is not entitled to benefits if the claimant fails to prove that they were capable of and available for work and unable to obtain suitable employment.\n[17] Subsection 52(1) of the EIA provides that the Commission may reconsider a claim for benefits within 36 months after benefits have been paid or would have been payable. If the Commission decides that a person has received money by way of benefits for which the person was not qualified or to which the person was not entitled, the Commission may seek repayment of the monies overpaid under subsections 52(2) and 52(3) of the EIA. If the Commission is of the opinion that a false or misleading statement or representation was made in connection with the claim, the Commission has an additional 36 months within which to reconsider the claim (EIA, subsection 52(5)).\n[18] In exercising its discretion to reconsider a claim, the Commission is guided by a number of principles set out in its Digest of Benefit Entitlement Principles. Chapter 17 of the Digest addresses among other things, error correction and reconsideration. Sections 17.3.2.2, 17.3.3 and 17.3.3.2 are relevant to this application.\n[19] Section 17.3.2.2 provides that a Commission error will occur when the Commission has all the relevant information needed to make a decision, but the information does not support the final decision. If benefits were incorrectly paid, the Commission will correct the error currently and no overpayment will be created. However, if the error resulted in a decision that is contrary to the structure of the EIA, the Commission will correct the error retroactively and an overpayment will occur.\n[20] Additionally, section 17.3.3, entitled \u201cReconsideration policy\u201d, provides that the Commission has developed a policy to ensure a consistent and fair application of section 52 of the EIA and to prevent creating debt when a claimant was overpaid through no fault of their own. It further states that a claim will only be reconsidered when (1) benefits have been underpaid, (2) benefits were paid contrary to the structure of the EIA, (3) benefits were paid as a result of a false or misleading statement, and (4) the claimant ought to have known there was no entitlement to the benefits received. Section 17.3.3.2 specifies that decisions on availability are not decisions that run contrary to the structure of the EIA.\n(2) Absence of New Information [21] Ms. Molchan submits that the Appeal Division erred in finding that the Commission could reconsider her availability in the absence of any new information. She argues that allowing retroactive reconsideration in the absence of new information undermines the central object and purpose of the employment insurance scheme, which is to provide financial security to those put out of work through no fault of their own. She further argues that the power to retroactively reconsider a claim is an exceptional one and should be construed strictly.\n[22] Ms. Molchan has failed to persuade me that the Appeal Division erred in this regard.\n[23] The Appeal Division concluded that the Commission had the authority to reconsider Ms. Molchan\u2019s claim for benefits, even in the absence of new information. In reaching this conclusion, the Appeal Division compared the Commission\u2019s authority to reconsider a claim for benefits under section 52 of the EIA with its authority to rescind or amend a decision under section 111 of the EIA. The Appeal Division noted that, under section 111, the Commission has the authority to rescind or amend a decision given in any particular claim if new facts are presented, or if it is satisfied that the decision was given without the knowledge of, or was based on a mistake as to, some material facts. In contrast, section 52 applies despite section 111 and is not limited to situations of new facts or mistakes of material facts. On this basis, the Appeal Division held that the reconsideration authority under section 52 was much broader than what Ms. Molchan advanced (AD Decision at paras. 67-69).\n[24] While finding that new facts are not required for the Commission to exercise its reconsideration authority under section 52 of the EIA, the Appeal Division nonetheless agreed with Ms. Molchan that the absence of new facts is a relevant factor for the Commission to consider, as it goes to the finality of a decision. However, it added that other factors are equally relevant. One such factor, under the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy, is false statements (AD Decision at paras. 75-76).\n[25] The Appeal Division went on to add that, if it was wrong and new facts are indeed required for the Commission to exercise its authority under section 52 of the EIA, reconsideration of Ms. Molchan\u2019s claim was appropriate given that the overpayment did not arise because the Commission changed its mind on the same facts. While the Commission may have mistakenly decided that Ms. Molchan was initially entitled to benefits, her ongoing entitlement was assessed based on the information she provided in her bi-weekly reports, which was different from that initially reported verbally to the Commission.\n[26] The Appeal Division explained that, starting the week of June 21, 2020, Ms. Molchan consistently answered \u201cyes\u201d in her biweekly reports when asked whether she was \u201cready, willing and capable of working each day, Monday through Friday, during each week of this report\u201d. The Appeal Division found that this information was different from the information that she had previously provided to the Commission (AD Decision at paras. 79-81).\n[27] Indeed, the record shows that, on June 19, 2020, the Commission formed the view that Ms. Molchan could transition to regular benefits on the premise that she was available for and capable of working, but not capable of doing the same work as in her previous employment because she could not sit for an extended period (Applicant\u2019s record at 152). This information is different from the information she gave to the Commission on March 4, 2021 when she confirmed to the agent that she could not work at all (Applicant\u2019s record at 161). On this basis, I am satisfied that the Appeal Division could reasonably conclude that there was new information justifying reconsideration of the claim.\n[28] In any event, I find that the Appeal Division\u2019s conclusion that new facts or information are not required under section 52 of the EIA for the Commission to reconsider a claimant\u2019s entitlement is reasonable. First, subsection 52(1) of the EIA begins with the words \u201cDespite section 111\u201d (\u201cMalgr\u00e9 l\u2019article 111\u201d). These words clearly suggest that the scope of subsection 52(1) is much broader than the power of rescission or amendment found in section 111 of the EIA, which is limited to the presentation of new facts. Second, the Appeal Division\u2019s interpretation is also consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in Bri\u00e8re v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission), [1989] 3 F.C. 88, 57 D.L.R. (4th) 402 (F.C.A.), where the Court found that the equivalent of these provisions served different purposes (Bri\u00e8re at 112-114).\n(3) False statements [29] Ms. Molchan also submits that the Appeal Division could not reasonably find that she gave false information when she specifically reported what she was told to report.\n[30] The Appeal Division accepted Ms. Molchan\u2019s submission that she was following the advice she received from the Commission\u2019s agents. However, it found that the statements made in the biweekly reports were nonetheless inaccurate (AD Decision at para. 84). The Appeal Division noted that a decision about capability and availability is not a onetime decision binding for the life of the benefit period and added that claimants must prove they are capable of and available for work for every working day in the benefit period (AD Decision at para. 85).\n[31] In my view, the Appeal Division\u2019s reasoning is both factually reasonable and consistent with paragraph 18(1)(a) of the EIA and the relevant case law. Although her biweekly reports indicated the contrary, Ms. Molchan admitted that she was not capable of and available for work during the period she collected regular EI benefits.\n[32] That said, the Appeal Division nonetheless considered whether it should refrain from applying the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy given that Ms. Molchan was directed by the Commission to make the false statements (AD Decision at para. 113). Relying on the decision of this Court in Canada (Attorney General) v. Buors, 2002 FCA 372, the Appeal Division held that Ms. Molchan could not rely on the Commission\u2019s misinformation to avoid an overpayment.\n[33] While Ms. Molchan may not agree with the Appeal Division\u2019s interpretation of the Commission\u2019s authority to reconsider her claim, she has not persuaded me that the Appeal Division\u2019s findings are unreasonable.\nC. Judicial exercise of discretion [34] In her memorandum of fact and law, Ms. Molchan submits that the Appeal Division erred in concluding that the Commission had exercised its discretion to reconsider the claim judicially. However, it is not what the Appeal Division concluded. It found the contrary.\n[35] Nonetheless, Ms. Molchan argues that the Appeal Division misconstrued this Court\u2019s decision in Buors. She also contends that the Appeal Division unreasonably determined that financial hardship and delay were not relevant factors to the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion to retroactively reconsider the claim. Finally, she is of the view that the Appeal Division unreasonably concluded that her claim should be retroactively reconsidered in all of the circumstances.\n[36] Ms. Molchan\u2019s arguments must fail.\n[37] First, the Appeal Division reasonably applied this Court\u2019s decision in Buors to find that Ms. Molchan could not rely on the Commission\u2019s misinformation to avoid the application of the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy.\n[38] Ms. Molchan had argued that her situation was distinguishable from the situation in Buors because that case involved a decision about a benefit rate, which rate was set by law and went to the structure of the EIA. The Appeal Division disagreed, finding instead that the decision in Buors was about the allocation of unreported earnings, which did not run contrary to the structure of the EIA, as defined by the Commission. The Appeal Division found that, in both cases, the overpayments had arisen due to misinformation about how to complete the reports. As a result, it felt bound by the direction of this Court in Buors (AD Decision at paras. 119-122).\n[39] I find that the Appeal Division\u2019s findings are consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in Buors, which followed the majority decision in Granger v. Canada Employment and Immigration Commission, [1986] 3 F.C. 70, 29 D.L.R. (4th) 501 (F.C.A.) (Granger), later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in Granger v. Canada (Canada Employment and Immigration Commission), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 141. This Court held in Granger that \u201cthe Commission and its representatives have no power to amend the law, and \u2026 therefore the interpretations which they may give of that law do not themselves have the force of law. \u2026 any commitment which [they] may give, whether in good or bad faith, to act in a way other than that prescribed by the law would be absolutely void and contrary to public order\u201d (Granger at 77). The Appeal Division\u2019s findings are also consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in Paxton v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 FCA 360 at paragraphs 14-15. The Appeal Division could not ignore this relevant case law.\n[40] Second, I am satisfied that the Appeal Division\u2019s treatment of financial hardship and delay was reasonable.\n[41] After deciding to substitute its decision for that of the General Division, the Appeal Division examined which factors are relevant to the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion to reconsider a claim. It began by noting that the EIA is silent on what factors are relevant to the exercise of discretion under section 52 of the EIA, but indicated that another decision of the Appeal Division, M.S. v. Canada Employment Insurance Commission, 2022 SST 933, had previously examined the issue in detail. The Appeal Division observed that in M.S., another member had found that factors that help resolve the tension between claimants\u2019 ability to rely on the finality of decisions and the Commission\u2019s interest in their accuracy are relevant to the exercise of discretion. The member had determined that the factors set out in the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy address this tension and are therefore relevant. However, it had added that, while the Commission should consider the factors in the policy, it is not necessarily bound to apply them (AD Decision at paras. 43-48).\n[42] The Appeal Division agreed with the reasoning in M.S. and applied it to Ms. Molchan\u2019s situation. It added that there may be additional relevant factors aside from those listed in the policy, but specified that relevant factors are those that relate to finality and accuracy (AD Decision at para. 49).\n[43] Applying these principles, the Appeal Division agreed with Ms. Molchan that, in exercising its discretion to reconsider the claim, the Commission had overlooked certain factors that the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy identifies as relevant. Specifically, it noted that the Commission had failed to consider the impact of the Commission\u2019s error on Ms. Molchan as well as the absence of fault on Ms. Molchan\u2019s part. The Appeal Division also found that the Commission had failed to take into account a factor which relates to the finality of the decision, namely that Ms. Molchan\u2019s reliance on the initial mistaken decision had led her not to pursue other possible pandemic-related benefits (AD Decision at paras. 97-100). Likewise, the Appeal Division noted that the Commission had not considered Ms. Molchan\u2019s honesty in dealing with the Commission (AD Decision at para. 103).\n[44] However, the Appeal Division disagreed with Ms. Molchan on the relevance of other factors. Ms. Molchan had argued that the Commission\u2019s delay in addressing her entitlement had created a large debt and put her in a difficult financial situation in having to repay it. The Appeal Division found that the argument of delay was not relevant, as the Commission had acted within the statutory period (AD Decision at para. 102). The Appeal Division further found irrelevant that the Commission had not considered Ms. Molchan\u2019s financial hardship. The Appeal Division observed that financial hardship does not go directly to either of the factors of finality or accuracy; rather it is meant to be taken into account in the context of the write-off procedure provided in the legislation, in particular at subparagraph 56(1)(f)(ii) of the Employment Insurance Regulations, S.O.R.\/96-332 (AD Decision at para. 102). In the end, the Appeal Division concluded that the Commission had not exercised its discretion judicially when it failed to consider all relevant factors (AD Decision at para. 104).\n[45] Having reached this conclusion, the Appeal Division then proceeded to give the decision the General Division should have given and considered whether discretion should be exercised to reconsider the claim. After noting several factors arguing against reconsideration, the Appeal Division found that Ms. Molchan\u2019s false statements, albeit made innocently, were pivotal to the Commission\u2019s assessment of her availability for work. Had she accurately declared that she was not capable of work, the Commission could have corrected its initial error and Ms. Molchan would have stopped receiving benefits. Despite noting that the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy lists false statements as a ground for reconsideration, the Appeal Division nonetheless considered whether the policy should be applied given that Ms. Molchan was directed to make false statements by the Commission. The Appeal Division felt bound by this Court\u2019s decision in Buors and determined that the claim was to be reconsidered, meaning that the overpayment remained.\n[46] Ms. Molchan relies on this Court\u2019s decision in Canada (Attorney General) v. Schembri, 2003 FCA 463 to argue that financial hardship is a relevant factor when the Commission exercises its discretion.\n[47] It does not appear from the record that Schembri was raised directly before either the General Division or the Appeal Division.\n[48] In any event, I find that the Schembri decision is distinguishable.\n[49] The issue in Schembri was whether the Commission was bound to take into account the claimant\u2019s financial circumstances when determining the penalty to impose. The claimant in that case had failed to report his earnings and collected unemployment benefits for several months. The Commission had calculated that the claimant had received a benefit overpayment of $4,130, which it sought to recover. It had also assessed a penalty under section 38 of the EIA, because the claimant had received unemployment benefits by knowingly misreporting his income contrary to paragraph 38(1)(c) of the EIA. In determining the amount of penalty payable, the Commission considered the claimant\u2019s gambling addiction and his efforts to deal with it, and reduced the penalty by 25% to $3,097. The Board of Referees later exonerated the claimant from any penalty. The Umpire then found that the Commission had erred when it failed to undertake, on its own initiative, an inquiry into the claimant\u2019s financial circumstances and whether it would cause the claimant undue hardship to pay the proposed penalty. The Umpire reduced the penalty imposed by the Commission from 75% to 10% of the amount of the overpayment.\n[50] On judicial review, this Court held that the Commission was not required to initiate its own inquiries into a person\u2019s financial circumstances before it imposed a penalty, noting that claimants have ample opportunities to request a reduction of the penalty on the ground of financial hardship at various stages of the process: before the penalty is imposed, on request for reconsideration and on appeal to the Board of Referees (Schembri at para. 14). Since the claimant had not raised the issue with the Commission and the Board of Referees, this Court decided that the Umpire should have held that the Board had no basis to interfere with the penalty.\n[51] In my view, this Court\u2019s findings in Schembri do not extend to the reconsideration of a claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits. The overpayment in Schembri was not in dispute, only the amount of penalty the claimant would have to pay. Subsection 38(1) of the EIA specifies the acts or omissions for which a claimant may be subject to a penalty and subsection 38(2) sets the maximum penalties the Commission may impose. Under section 41 of the EIA, the Commission may rescind the imposition of a penalty or reduce it, on the presentation of new facts or on being satisfied that the penalty was imposed without knowledge of, or on the basis of a mistake as to, some material fact. Furthermore the Commission may issue, under section 41.1, a warning instead of setting the amount of a penalty for an act or omission under subsections 38(2) and 39(2) of the EIA. The Commission thus enjoys a wide discretion in assessing the amount of penalty and may consider financial hardship to the claimant as a mitigating factor.\n[52] This is consistent with the Commission\u2019s policy regarding penalties, which mentions financial hardship as a possible mitigating circumstance when determining penalties (Digest of Benefit Entitlement Principles, section 18.5.2.2). It appears from the record that the Commission did not apply a penalty in Ms. Molchan\u2019s case despite her false statements (Applicant\u2019s record at 130, 173, 178).\n[53] In contrast, the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion under section 52 of the EIA is tied to a claimant\u2019s qualification for, or entitlement to, benefits and is guided by the factors set out in the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy and those that relate to finality and accuracy. The Commission\u2019s policy does not list financial hardship as a factor. While the Appeal Division acknowledged that there may be other relevant factors, I have not been persuaded that financial hardship goes directly to either finality or accuracy.\n[54] When the Commission finds, upon reconsideration, that the claimant was not entitled to receive benefits, it is required under subsection 52(2) to calculate the amount to which the claimant was not entitled and notify the claimant. Pursuant to subsection 52(3), the amount calculated is repayable under section 43 of the EIA, which provides that a claimant is liable to repay an amount paid by the Commission as benefits and to which the claimant was not entitled. An amount payable under this provision becomes a debt due to His Majesty under subsection 47(1) of the EIA. Although the Commission has the discretion to reconsider the claim within a specified period, the Commission enjoys no discretion in setting the amount to be repaid since liability arises directly from a determination that the claimant was disentitled from receiving benefits (Canada (Attorney General) v. L\u00e9vesque, 2001 FCA 304 at para. 2). This is different from the Commission setting the amount of penalty a claimant should pay.\n[55] In my view, the Appeal Division\u2019s comments regarding Ms. Molchan\u2019s ability to seek a write-off of her debt are consistent with the legislation, which sets out a specific procedure, a write-off, for undue hardship cases. Subparagraph 56(1)(f)(ii) of the Employment Insurance Regulations explicitly provides the Commission with the authority to write off an amount payable under section 43 of the EIA if repayment of the amount due would result in undue hardship to the claimant.\n[56] That said, I am nonetheless of the view that the Appeal Division was clearly cognizant of and empathetic to the financial hardship to Ms. Molchan in having to repay her debt. Like the General Division, the Appeal Division implored the Commission and the Canada Revenue Agency to consider any request by Ms. Molchan to write off her debt, given the circumstances in which the overpayment arose. The Appeal Division even went as far as providing in a footnote the telephone number where she could call to seek relief.\n[57] Finally, Ms. Molchan also contends that the Appeal Division unreasonably concluded that her claim should be retroactively reconsidered in all of the circumstances. I find that she is essentially asking the Court to reassess the relevant factors and the weight afforded to them in order to reach a different outcome. That is not this Court\u2019s role on judicial review.\n[58] To conclude, despite her counsel\u2019s able submissions, I am satisfied that the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is reasonable. It is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and is justified in relation to the facts and the law it was required to apply in the circumstances (Vavilov at para. 85). Although I am sympathetic to Ms. Molchan\u2019s unfortunate situation, I am unable to find any basis upon which to intervene.\n[59] Accordingly, I would dismiss the application for judicial review. The respondent did not seek costs and none will be awarded.\n\"Sylvie E. Roussel\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nDavid Stratas J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nJohn B.

Overview [1] The applicant, Ms. T-Giorgis, seeks judicial review of a decision of the Appeal Division of the Social Security Tribunal dated February 24, 2023 (2023 SST 196).\n[2] Ms. T-Giorgis filed an initial application for employment insurance benefits on March 20, 2020. In her application, she reported that she was taking a full-time course of study on her own initiative. She received the new Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit (EI\u2011ERB) until September 27, 2020 and then transitioned to regular employment insurance benefits. Prior to the transition, she completed another training questionnaire detailing her academic program. She reported that she would be attending full-time, non-referred training from September 9, 2020 to December 8, 2020 and that she would spend between 15 and 24 hours a week on her studies. She also reported that her course obligations occurred outside her normal work hours and that she was obligated to attend her scheduled classes (Applicant\u2019s record at 259-262).\n[3] On October 27, 2020, the Canada Employment Insurance Commission called Ms. T\u2011Giorgis about her availability and confirmed that she was entitled to benefits while in her training course until December 15, 2020 (Applicant\u2019s record at 263). Ms. T-Giorgis continued to receive regular benefits until September 4, 2021. During this period, she continued to report in her biweekly reports that she was a full-time student and that she had worked part-time at various jobs during her studies.\n[4] After Ms. T-Giorgis completed her biweekly reports for the period starting in September 2021, the Commission referred her claim for review (Applicant\u2019s record at 491-492). On January 11, 2022, an agent of the Commission called Ms. T-Giorgis to discuss her schooling. Ms. T\u2011Giorgis stated that she was in a four-year university program that had started in September 2019 and expected to finish it in May 2023. She also informed the Commission that she was spending over 30 hours a week on her studies, that she was working part-time while going to school, and that she would not leave her courses in order to accept full-time work (Applicant\u2019s record at 493).\n[5] On January 19, 2022, the Commission sent Ms. T-Giorgis a letter informing her that she was not entitled to benefits from September 28, 2020 onward, because she had not proven her availability for work while attending non-referred training (Applicant\u2019s record at 496). The Commission\u2019s decision created an overpayment on Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 account. Ms. T\u2011Giorgis applied for reconsideration, but the Commission upheld its decision (Applicant\u2019s record at 505).\n[6] Ms. T-Giorgis then appealed the decision to the General Division of the Social Security Tribunal. On July 5, 2022, the General Division found that the Commission had made initial decisions to allow Ms. T\u2011Giorgis\u2019 training and pay her benefits until September 4, 2021 (2022 SST 1665). It also held that the Commission could verify her availability for work within her benefit period, even after benefits were paid, under section 153.161 of the Employment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996, c. 23 (EIA). However, the General Division determined that the Commission did not properly exercise its discretion to reconsider the claim retroactively, as it took into account an irrelevant factor and ignored others that were relevant.\n[7] The General Division then proceeded to make the decision the Commission should have made. It found that the Commission should not have reviewed the decision entitling Ms. T\u2011Giorgis to benefits until September 4, 2021 since nothing had changed in her situation to trigger a review of the initial decision. As for the period after that, the General Division found that the Commission had not made an initial entitlement decision. In reviewing the claimant\u2019s availability for work, the General Division determined that Ms. T-Giorgis was not available for work and upheld the disentitlement.\n[8] The Commission appealed the decision to the Appeal Division. It submitted that the General Division erred in determining that Ms. T-Giorgis was not disentitled to regular benefits for the period of September 2020 to September 2021. In particular, the Commission disagreed with the General Division\u2019s interpretation of section 153.161 of the EIA, arguing that decisions made under that provision constituted initial entitlement decisions. The Commission argued that the only decision it made on entitlement was on October 27, 2020, when it approved Ms. T\u2011Giorgis\u2019 benefits up to December 15, 2020. As for the period from December 16, 2020 to September 2021, the Commission asserted that it had not made a decision on entitlement until January 2022 when it verified Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 entitlement under section 153.161 of the EIA. The Commission also challenged the General Division\u2019s finding that it had not exercised its discretion judicially in reconsidering the claim.\n[9] The Appeal Division allowed the appeal in part. It agreed with the General Division that section 153.161 of the EIA does not permit a delayed entitlement decision (AD Decision at para. 55). Section 153.161 of the EIA allows the Commission to make an initial entitlement decision based on the statements made by a claimant in their application for benefits and their claimant reports, and to postpone its verification of the claimant\u2019s entitlement to a later date. If the Commission seeks verification after the benefits were paid and the Commission finds that the claimant has not proven their availability for work, then the Commission has the discretion to decide under section 52 of the EIA whether it is going to reconsider the claim. It further held that, in doing so, the Commission is required to exercise its discretion judicially (AD Decision at paras. 67, 75-76).\n[10] Nonetheless, the Appeal Division found that the General Division erred in law when it assessed the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion. It found that the General Division should have considered the relevance of section 153.161 of the EIA to that decision, instead of focusing solely on the absence of new facts justifying the Commission changing its initial entitlement decisions.\n[11] The Appeal Division determined that the appropriate remedy was to substitute its decision on the issue of whether the Commission had exercised its discretion judicially. The Appeal Division divided the claim into two periods.\n[12] First, it decided that the Commission did not exercise its discretion judicially for the period between September 28, 2020 and December 15, 2020. The Commission had already verified Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 entitlement to benefits when it had a conversation with her about her training on October 27, 2020. When the Commission decided that she was entitled to benefits, it was satisfied that Ms. T-Giorgis had proven her availability. The Appeal Division found that the factors in the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy applied and the claim should not be reconsidered for that period (AD Decision at paras. 146-165).\n[13] The Appeal Division then considered the period between December 16, 2020 and September 4, 2021. It found that the Commission had exercised its discretion in a judicial manner since it did not verify entitlement until January 11, 2022 (AD Decision at paras. 129, 166-167). Despite substituting its decision on the issue of discretion, the Appeal Division found that it could not make a final decision on whether Ms. T-Giorgis was available for work during this period and decided to return the issue to the General Division.\n[14] Before this Court, Ms. T-Giorgis raises four grounds on which she asserts that the decision of the Appeal Division is unreasonable. Albeit in a different order, she argues first that the Appeal Division unreasonably concluded that the Commission\u2019s decision to reconsider her claim engages section 153.161 of the EIA. Second, she argues that the Appeal Division misconstrued the term \u201cverify\u201d in subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA as allowing the Commission to retroactively change a decision even if the verification reveals no new information. Third, she submits that the Appeal Division should have applied the Commission\u2019s policy to the reconsideration of the claim from December 16, 2020 and September 4, 2021. Finally, Ms. T-Giorgis challenges the Appeal Division\u2019s conclusion that the Commission exercised its discretion judicially for the weeks between December 16, 2020 and September 4, 2021. She does not take issue with the Commission\u2019s decision to stop benefits after September 4, 2021.\nII. Analysis A. Standard of Review [15] The parties agree that the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is reviewable on the deferential standard of reasonableness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65; Page v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 169 at para. 48; Canada (Attorney General) v. Hull, 2022 FCA 82 at paras. 12-13; Hillier v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 44 at para. 12).\n[16] When the standard of reasonableness applies, the Court\u2019s focus is on \u201cwhether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision\u201d (Vavilov at para. 99). It must be internally coherent, and display a rational chain of analysis (Vavilov at para. 85). The burden is on the party challenging the decision to show that it is unreasonable and the Court \u201cmust be satisfied that any shortcomings or flaws relied on \u2026 are sufficiently central or significant to render the decision unreasonable\u201d (Vavilov at para. 100).\n[17] One of the relevant constraints is subsection 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act, S.C. 2005, c. 34 (DESDA). It specifies that the Appeal Division can only intervene if the General Division (a) failed to observe a principle of natural justice or otherwise acted beyond or refused to exercise its jurisdiction; (b) erred in law in making its decision, whether or not the error appears on the face of the record; or (c) based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it. Paragraph 58(1)(c) of the DESDA does not allow the Appeal Division to overturn a decision of the General Division on the basis that it would have weighed the evidence differently (Sibbald v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 157 at para. 27; Uvaliyev v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 222 at para. 7).\n[18] Once the Appeal Division finds there is a legitimate reason to intervene, it may proceed to decide questions of fact that are necessary for the disposition of the appeal (Nelson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 222 at para. 17) and give the decision the General Division should have given or, as it did in this case, refer the matter back for reconsideration in accordance with any directions it considers appropriate (DESDA, subsection 59(1)).\nB. Relevant Framework [19] At the outset, it is useful to set out the statutory and policy framework relevant to this application.\n[20] Employment insurance benefits are payable to claimants who meet the statutory requirements. To receive benefits, claimants must first qualify to receive benefits. They must demonstrate that they have suffered an interruption of earnings from employment and that they have had a minimum number of hours of insurable employment in a period preceding the claim (EIA, sections 7, 8).\n[21] Claimants must also not be disentitled to receive benefits. Pursuant to paragraph 18(1)(a) of the EIA, a claimant is not entitled to benefits if the claimant fails to prove that they were capable of and available for work and unable to obtain suitable employment.\n[22] Under paragraph 25(1)(a) of the EIA, as it now reads and as it read at the relevant time, a claimant is considered unemployed and capable of and available for work during a period when they are attending a course of instruction or training program to which they were referred by the Commission or a designated authority. In other words, a claimant who is referred by the Commission does not need to prove availability.\n[23] Section 153.161 of the EIA was added to the EIA on September 27, 2020, by Interim Order No. 10 Amending the Employment Insurance Act (Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit), Canada Gazette, Part II, Vol. 154, No. 21, S.O.R.\/2020-208. The Explanatory Note to Interim Order No. 10 provides among other things that the interim order enables a modified operational approach to the assessment of availability to work for claimants in training. It also specifies that the provisions made under the interim order will cease to have effect on September 25, 2021.\n[24] Section 153.161 of the EIA reads as follows:\nAvailability\nDisponibilit\u00e9\nCourse, program of instruction or non-referred training\nCours ou programme d\u2019instruction ou de formation non dirig\u00e9\n153.161 (1) For the purposes of applying paragraph 18(1)(a), a claimant who attends a course, program of instruction or training to which the claimant is not referred under paragraphs 25(1)(a) or (b) is not entitled to be paid benefits for any working day in a benefit period for which the claimant is unable to prove that on that day they were capable of and available for work.\n153.161 (1) Pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 18(1)a), le prestataire qui suit un cours ou programme d\u2019instruction ou de formation pour lequel il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux alin\u00e9as 25(1)a) ou b) n\u2019est pas admissible au versement des prestations pour tout jour ouvrable d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de prestations pour lequel il ne peut prouver qu\u2019il \u00e9tait, ce jour-l\u00e0, capable de travailler et disponible \u00e0 cette fin.\nVerification\nV\u00e9rification\n(2) The Commission may, at any point after benefits are paid to a claimant, verify that the claimant referred to in subsection (1) is entitled to those benefits by requiring proof that they were capable of and available for work on any working day of their benefit period.\n(2) La Commission peut v\u00e9rifier, \u00e0 tout moment apr\u00e8s le versement des prestations, que le prestataire vis\u00e9 au paragraphe (1) est admissible aux prestations en exigeant la preuve qu\u2019il \u00e9tait capable de travailler et disponible \u00e0 cette fin pour tout jour ouvrable de sa p\u00e9riode de prestations.\n[25] Subsection 52(1) of the EIA provides that the Commission may reconsider a claim for benefits within 36 months after benefits have been paid or would have been payable. If the Commission decides that a person has received money by way of benefits for which the person was not qualified or to which the person was not entitled, the Commission may seek repayment of the monies overpaid under subsections 52(2) and 52(3) of the EIA.\n[26] The Commission\u2019s Digest of Benefit Entitlement Principles also contains a number of principles that the Commission applies, including when it makes decisions relating to availability and the reconsideration of claims. Sections 10.12.2, 17.3.2.2, 17.3.3 and 17.3.3.2 are relevant to this application.\n[27] Section 10.12.2 of the Digest, found in Chapter 10 \u2013 Availability, is directed at persons attending courses on their own initiative. It provides that, before rendering a decision regarding the availability of a claimant who is attending a course on their own initiative, the agent of the Commission will consider whether the claimant could be referred to a similar course, pursuant to subsection 25(1) of the EIA. If so, and a referral is made, the claimant will not be required to show that they were unemployed, capable of, and available for work. If not, the agent will document the file by indicating that the option was reviewed and the reasons it is not available. The agent will then make a determination as to the claimant\u2019s availability for work while taking the course.\n[28] Chapter 17 of the Digest addresses among other things, error correction and reconsideration. Section 17.3.2.2 states that a Commission error will occur when the Commission has all the relevant information needed to make a decision, but the information does not support the final decision. If the benefits were incorrectly paid, the Commission will correct the error currently and no overpayment will be created. However, if the error resulted in a decision that is contrary to the structure of the EIA, the Commission will correct the error retroactively and an overpayment will occur.\n[29] Additionally, section 17.3.3, entitled \u201cReconsideration policy\u201d, provides that the Commission has developed a policy to ensure a consistent and fair application of section 52 of the EIA and to prevent creating debt when a claimant was overpaid through no fault of their own. It further states that a claim will only be reconsidered when (1) benefits have been underpaid, (2) benefits were paid contrary to the structure of the EIA, (3) benefits were paid as a result of a false or misleading statement, and (4) the claimant ought to have known there was no entitlement to the benefits received. Section 17.3.3.2 specifies that decisions on availability are not decisions that run contrary to the structure of the EIA.\nC. Application of Section 153.161 of the EIA [30] Ms. T-Giorgis submits that the Appeal Division unreasonably concluded that the Commission\u2019s decision to reconsider her claim engages section 153.161 of the EIA. In her view, subsection 153.161(2) does not apply to her claim because the Commission had approved her training. As a result, under section 10.12.2 of the Digest, she did not have to prove her availability.\n[31] This argument cannot succeed because the record does not establish that the Commission, or a delegated authority, either referred her for training under subsection 25(1) of the EIA or made a referral under section 10.12.2 of the Digest.\n[32] The supplementary record of claim relating to the October 27, 2020 telephone conversation demonstrates that, while Ms. T-Giorgis discussed her training with the agent for the period between September 9, 2020 and December 15, 2020, the agent identified availability as the main issue for discussion. There is no indication that the agent approved her training and made a referral as articulated in section 10.12.2 of the Digest. To the contrary, the supplementary record of claim reports that the Commission advised Ms. T-Giorgis of a decision, of its impact on the claim and of her right to file a formal request for reconsideration and of the applicable time frame. Although the nature of the decision is not explicitly stated, I fail to see why the Commission would have informed Ms. T-Giorgis of her right to file a request for reconsideration if it had referred her for training. I find it is more likely that the Commission found Ms. T-Giorgis to be available for work despite her training, but only for the period until December 15, 2020 (Applicant\u2019s record at 263). This is supported by the fact that decisions regarding referral are not reviewable, as per subsection 25(2) of the EIA, while decisions regarding availability are reviewable.\n[33] Ms. T-Giorgis also claims the automated messages she received after submitting her biweekly reports demonstrate that her training was approved. She relies in particular on the automated messages from her February and May 2021 biweekly reports, in which the Commission mentions that it has \u201callowed\u201d her training period (Applicant\u2019s record at 334, 402).\n[34] Ms. T-Giorgis is misconstruing the automated messages. They do not say that her training has been approved such that it is captured by subsection 25(1) of the EIA or section 10.12.2 of the Digest. On the contrary, they include a warning that proof of her availability may later be requested and could impact her entitlement to benefits for the training period. This statement, in my view, is inconsistent with the presumption of status found in both subsection 25(1) of the EIA and section 10.12.2 of the Digest. If the Commission had indeed made a referral under the section 10.12.2 of the Digest, Ms. T-Giorgis would not have been required to prove her availability.\n[35] I also find that Ms. T-Giorgis is misconstruing paragraph 33 of the General Division\u2019s decision. The General Division\u2019s statement that the Commission allowed the training must be read in the proper context. The General Division was examining the issue of whether the Commission had made initial entitlement decisions to allow the payment of benefits regardless of her training. The General Division found that the Commission had made initial entitlement decisions. However, it also found that the Commission had the authority to go back and verify if Ms. T-Giorgis was available for work within her benefit period.\n[36] To conclude on this point, Ms. T-Giorgis has failed to persuade me that she was referred for training under either subsection 25(1) of the EIA or section 10.12.2 of the Digest. Accordingly, I am satisfied that it was reasonable for the Appeal Division to find that section 153.161 of the EIA applies to Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 circumstances.\nD. Verification of Entitlement After Benefits Paid [37] Ms. T-Giorgis submits that, even if section 153.161 of the EIA is relevant, it does not give the Commission the power to retroactively reconsider her availability absent new information. In her view, the purpose of verification is to confirm or supplement the facts and information upon which the original decision was based. It is not to give the Commission an opportunity to render a second decision based on the same information.\n[38] She argues that subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA was never intended to address some general difficulty in making timely decisions on benefit entitlement during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it only applies to students, a small subset of total claimants. She contends that it was meant to address the fact that most claimants who were automatically transitioned from the EI-ERB were not required to complete an initial application for benefits, which would typically have required them to provide detailed information about their training programs. Without an initial application for benefits, the Commission would not have had the information it would usually have at the start of the claim. Subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA gave the Commission the power to pay benefits and then later obtain any missing information to verify the claim. If new information was uncovered, the Commission could then retroactively reconsider the claim under section 52 of the EIA.\n[39] These arguments do not persuade me that the Appeal Division\u2019s interpretation of section 153.161 is unreasonable.\n[40] The Appeal Division concluded that, together, subsection 153.161(2) and section 52 of the EIA empower the Commission to verify entitlement to benefits paid to students in non-referred training and to assess an overpayment.\n[41] In coming to this conclusion, the Appeal Division first considered the text of subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA. It found that the text of the provision is clear that verification of entitlement can happen after benefits were paid. In its view, verifying entitlement also implies that the Commission has already made a decision (AD Decision at para. 60).\n[42] The Appeal Division further noted that the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA means that the authority to verify is discretionary. It found that this discretion is inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s position that this provision allows the making of a delayed entitlement decision. The Appeal Division observed that, if the Commission were to not exercise its discretion to verify the claim under subsection 153.161(2), this would mean the Commission would never make any decision regarding benefit entitlement (AD Decision at para. 61).\n[43] The Appeal Division then considered section 153.161 in the context of section 52 of the EIA. It noted that subsection 52(2) gives the Commission the discretion to reconsider a claim after benefits have been paid and to assess an overpayment when a person has received benefits for which they were not qualified or to which they were not entitled. The Appeal Division found that, if section 153.161 was interpreted as permitting a delayed entitlement decision, there would be no corresponding mechanism allowing the Commission to assess and recover the overpayment.\n[44] Given the text of section 153.161 and the context of section 52, the Appeal Division found that section 153.161 allows the Commission to make an initial entitlement decision based on the statements made by a claimant in their application for benefits and their biweekly reports, but to delay its verification of their availability for work to a later date (AD Decision at paras. 66-67).\n[45] The Appeal Division next considered the purpose of section 153.161 of the EIA. It found that its interpretation is consistent with the modified operational approach mentioned in the Explanatory Note to Interim Order 10. Given the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic, the legislature recognized that it was not always possible for the Commission to verify entitlement at the time of initial application.\n[46] The Appeal Division concluded that the Commission has the discretionary authority to seek verification of entitlement after benefits were paid under subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA. If that verification is sought and the Commission decides a claimant has not proven their availability for work, the Commission then has the discretion to decide under section 52 whether it is going to reconsider the claim. In both cases, the Commission must exercise its discretion judicially (AD Decision at para. 75).\n[47] The Appeal Division rejected Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 argument that new facts were needed for the Commission to change its initial entitlement decisions. The Appeal Division accepted that it was relevant that Ms. T-Giorgis was honest in her declaration. However, it noted that section 153.161 of the EIA does not refer to verification of the accuracy of the information provided by the claimant, but to verification of entitlement. The provision specifically contemplates the possibility that the Commission would reconsider claims for students in non-referred training after the payment of benefits, even if they had provided accurate information (AD Decision at paras. 169-170).\n[48] I am satisfied that the Appeal Division\u2019s interpretation of section 153.161 is reasonable in light of the text, context and purpose of the provision.\n[49] Section 153.161 of the EIA was in effect during the period in which Ms. T-Giorgis received benefits and is therefore relevant to her claim. The text of section 153.161 is clear. A claimant who attends non-referred training is not entitled to be paid benefits for any working day of their benefit period if they are unable to prove that on that day they were capable of and available for work. Also, the Commission may, at any point after benefits are paid to a claimant, verify that the claimant is entitled to those benefits by requiring proof they were capable of and available for work on any working day of their benefit period. In other words, verification of entitlement may occur after benefits have been paid.\n[50] Moreover, unlike section 111 of the EIA, which grants the Commission the authority to rescind or amend a decision given in any particular claim if new facts are presented or the decision was given in the absence of or based on a mistake as to a material fact, neither subsection 153.161(2) nor section 52 of the EIA require the existence of new information for the Commission to exercise its discretionary authority. Where new facts are required for a tribunal to reconsider, rescind or amend a previous decision, Parliament usually says so (see, e.g., EIA, sections 41, 65.1(4)).\n[51] I acknowledge the wording in the Explanatory Note to Interim Order No. 10, which specifies that the interim order provides authorities related to the transition from the EI-ERB to regular benefits. However, section 153.161 of the EIA was added to Part VIII.5 of the EIA. This part is entitled \u201cTemporary Measures to Facilitate Access to Benefits\u201d. It is reasonable to conclude that the purpose of section 153.161 of the EIA was to expedite benefit delivery to claimants who were students or receiving training by postponing verification of entitlement until after the payment of benefits, regardless of their transition to regular benefits. Prior to the implementation of section 153.161, applications for benefits would have normally involved assessing entitlement prior to the payment of benefits.\n[52] While there may be other available interpretations, including the one advanced by Ms. T-Giorgis, I find that the Appeal Division\u2019s interpretation is reasonable and does not warrant intervention by this Court.\nE. Application of the Commission\u2019s Reconsideration Policy [53] Ms. T-Giorgis submits that it was unreasonable for the Appeal Division to conclude that reconsideration of the claim occurred under section 52, but then to also conclude that the very policy governing reconsiderations under section 52 does not apply. She submits that the reconsideration policy should apply to all weeks and not just to the period before December 16, 2020.\n[54] I find that Ms. T-Giorgis is unduly isolating a portion of the Appeal Division\u2019s conclusion regarding the application of section 52 of the EIA. As noted earlier, the Appeal Division found that sections l53.161 and 52 of the EIA have to be read together. Together, they give the Commission the discretionary authority to seek verification of entitlement after the payment of benefits and to assess an overpayment, if appropriate.\n[55] The Appeal Division concluded that the reconsideration provisions in the Digest are not applicable to the verification of entitlement under subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA. It noted that the Commission\u2019s policy was developed prior to the addition of section 153.161 to the EIA and does not provide guidance on how section 153.161 should inform the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion under section 52 of the EIA (AD Decision at para. 118). It also considered the extraordinary circumstances under which section 153.161 was added to the EIA. The Appeal Division reasoned that Parliament therefore specifically contemplated the possibility of the Commission reconsidering claims for students in non-referred training where verification is sought and the student cannot prove their entitlement (AD Decision at paras. 118-121, 160-161). The Appeal Division determined that the policy was relevant for the period from September 28, 2020 to December 15, 2020 because the Commission had verified Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 entitlement. It was not relevant for the following period because verification of entitlement did not occur until January 2022.\n[56] I have not been persuaded that the Appeal Division made a reviewable error in finding that the Commission\u2019s reconsideration policy does not apply to Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 circumstances after December 15, 2020. When the Commission verified her entitlement in January 2022, it did so pursuant to subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA. The Commission determined that she was not entitled to benefits because she had not proven her availability for work while attending non-referred training. The Commission then exercised its discretion to reconsider the claim under section 52 of the EIA and assessed the overpayment. The Commission\u2019s authority was exercised under the joint application of subsection 153.161(2) and section 52 of the EIA.\n[57] This is different from the Commission\u2019s decision to reconsider entitlement for the period before December 16, 2020. The Commission had already verified Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 availability and decided that she was entitled to receive benefits. When it decided to assess an overpayment for this period, the Commission derived its authority to reconsider the claim from section 52 only, as it had already verified Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 entitlement to the benefits.\n[58] Given the Appeal Division\u2019s finding that the Commission was exercising its authority to verify entitlement and reconsider the claim under the joint application of subsection 153.161(2) and section 52 of the EIA, I am satisfied that it was reasonable for the Appeal Division to conclude that the reconsideration policy does not apply. In giving the Commission the authority to verify entitlement after the payment of benefits, Parliament had to have in mind the possibility of assessing and recovering overpayments where claimants were not entitled to receive benefits. If the reconsideration policy applied, I fail to see under what circumstances the Commission would exercise its discretion to verify entitlement since decisions on non-availability do not run contrary to the structure of the EIA and argue against reconsideration.\n[59] Moreover, the Digest is an administrative document that outlines different scenarios in which the Commission should reconsider a claim and is meant to ensure consistency in decisions and to avoid arbitrary decisions. While the Digest is an important tool to the Commission, it is not binding. Given the unique context in which section 153.161 was adopted, its purpose and the period during which it was in effect, the Appeal Division could reasonably find that the reconsideration policy does not apply.\nF. Judicial Exercise of Discretion [60] Ms. T-Giorgis challenges the Appeal Division\u2019s conclusion that the Commission exercised its discretion judicially for the weeks between December 16, 2020 and September 4, 2021. First, she argues that the Appeal Division\u2019s reasoning is circular, because a decision about whether to exercise discretion to retroactively reconsider a claim cannot be dictated by what the result would be if the claim was reconsidered. Second, she claims that it was inconsistent for the Appeal Division to conclude that the Commission had judicially exercised a discretion when it did not know it was exercising a discretion. Third, she argues that it was unreasonable for the Commission to approve her schooling for the fall 2020 semester and then revoke approval for subsequent semesters when there was no change in circumstances.\n[61] These arguments do not persuade me that the Appeal Division\u2019s conclusion on the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion is unreasonable.\n[62] The Appeal Division found that the Commission exercised its discretion judicially when it verified Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 entitlement in January 2022 and decided that Ms. T-Giorgis had not proven her availability for work. The Appeal Division also found that the Commission had considered all relevant information in deciding whether to reconsider the claim, including that Ms. T-Giorgis had been honest in her declarations, and that there was no evidence that the Commission had considered irrelevant information, acted in bad faith, or acted in a discriminatory manner (AD Decision at paras. 168, 173).\n[63] There is no basis for Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 argument that the result of a potential reconsideration cannot be part of deciding whether to exercise discretion to retroactively reconsider a claim. Reconsideration of a claim when entitlement is in question is a proper purpose, provided it is done within the time frame imposed under the EIA.\n[64] Likewise, the fact that the Commission does not expressly designate its analysis as an exercise of discretion does not change the fact that the analysis addresses what a discretionary analysis would address.\n[65] Finally, it is not unreasonable for the Commission to approve only one semester of a multi-semester degree since the determination of a claimant\u2019s availability for work requires a contextualized consideration of a claimant\u2019s circumstances (Page at paras. 69, 74).\n[66] I am satisfied that the Appeal Division\u2019s approach in determining whether the Commission exercised its discretion in a judicial manner is reasonable. Ms. T-Giorgis has failed to establish any reviewable error in the Appeal Division\u2019s conclusion on this issue.\n[67] At the hearing, Ms. T-Giorgis argued that the Commission overlooked certain relevant factors in the exercise of its discretion to reconsider the claim, including that the Commission\u2019s delay in addressing the situation had put her in a difficult situation and had created a large debt causing her hardship in having to repay the overpayment. This argument was not raised by Ms. T-Giorgis in her memorandum of fact and law and does not appear to have been raised before the Appeal Division. As a result, it would be inappropriate for this Court to entertain this argument (Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. Alberta Teachers\u2019 Association, 2011 SCC 61 at para. 23).\n[68] That said, in Molchan v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 46, rendered concurrently with this decision, I discuss the relevance of a similar argument. I find that the Appeal Division could reasonably find that financial hardship is meant to be considered in the context of a write-off under subparagraph 56(1)(f)(ii) of the Employment Insurance Regulations, which explicitly provides the Commission with the authority to write off an amount payable under section 43 of the EIA if repayment of the amount due would result in undue hardship to the claimant (Molchan at paras. 40-55). Section 43 of the EIA provides that a claimant is liable to repay an amount paid by the Commission to the claimant as benefits to which the claimant is not entitled. Therefore, Ms. T-Giorgis may ask the Commission for a write-off on the basis of financial hardship and it will be for the Commission to decide if relief is appropriate.\nIII. Conclusion [69] To conclude, despite her counsel\u2019s able submissions, Ms. T-Giorgis has failed to persuade me that the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is unreasonable. While she may not agree with the outcome, the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and is justified in relation to the facts and the law it was required to apply in the circumstances (Vavilov at para. 85). Although I am sympathetic to Ms. T-Giorgis\u2019 unfortunate situation, I am unable to find any basis upon which to intervene.\n[70] The Appeal Division\u2019s disposition was to send the matter back to the General Division. The General Division will reassess its findings on availability for the period between December 16, 2020 and September 4, 2021, and in doing so, should consider this Court\u2019s recent decision in Page.\n[71] For these reasons, I would dismiss the application for judicial review. The respondent did not seek costs and none will be awarded.\n\"Sylvie E. Roussel\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nDavid Stratas J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nJohn B.

Overview [1] The applicant, Mr. Puig, seeks judicial review of a decision of the Appeal Division of the Social Security Tribunal dated February 22, 2023 (2023 SST 192).\n[2] In September 2020, Mr. Puig resided in Canada as an international student registered in a one-year program. Following the advice of Service Canada agents, Mr. Puig applied for regular employment insurance (EI) benefits on October 7, 2020 after his previous employment was terminated. His application for benefits stated that he was a student and provided information about his program, including the fact that it was a full-time course, the number of days he was required to attend classes and the number of hours he spent in class. It also stated that he had not previously worked while taking a course or program (Applicant\u2019s record at 58-66).\n[3] Mr. Puig also provided copies of his previous work permit valid from June 2019 to June 2020 and of his study and work permits valid from June 2020 to November 2021. His study permit allowed him to work up to 20 hours per week while in school and his work permit was restricted to working for his school in the second phase of his training (Applicant\u2019s record at 67-73). His application was approved, and Mr. Puig collected EI benefits from October 5, 2020 to February 26, 2021.\n[4] On March 16 and 17, 2021, a Commission agent called Mr. Puig to discuss his studies and his entitlement to benefits. He was notified both verbally and in writing that he was disentitled from benefits from October 5, 2020 to February 26, 2021 for non-availability for work given the restrictions on his study permit, thereby creating an overpayment (Applicant\u2019s record at 74-78). Mr. Puig sought reconsideration, but the Commission upheld its decision (Applicant\u2019s record at 83-84).\n[5] Mr. Puig appealed the Commission\u2019s decision to the General Division of the Social Security Tribunal. In its decision (2021 SST 792), the General Division found that Mr. Puig wanted to work and that he had made reasonable efforts to find employment, but that his study permit and course schedule unduly affected his chances of returning to the labour market. It concluded that, except for the period from December 25, 2020 to January 3, 2021, Mr. Puig was not available for work until March 1, 2021 (Applicant\u2019s record at 145-155). The General Division expressed concern about how the Commission had handled the claim, but determined that it did not have the power to assist Mr. Puig. Dissatisfied, Mr. Puig appealed the decision to the Appeal Division.\n[6] The Appeal Division allowed the appeal and returned the matter to the General Division for reconsideration after finding that the General Division had not addressed the question of whether the Commission had the power to retroactively disentitle Mr. Puig and, if so, whether the Commission had acted judicially in doing so. On appeal, Mr. Puig did not dispute the General Division\u2019s decision on the issue of availability (GP v. Canada Employment Insurance Commission, 2021 SST 791 at para. 12).\n[7] In July 2022, the General Division concluded that section 153.161 of the Employment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996, c. 23 (EIA) gives the Commission the authority to disentitle Mr. Puig after benefits were paid (2022 SST 872). It accepted the Commission\u2019s argument that benefits were paid on the basis of qualification and that first-time entitlement decisions were made after benefits were paid. The General Division also concluded that the Commission had exercised its discretion judicially. It held that, even though Mr. Puig provided the Commission true and accurate information from the time he applied for benefits, once the Commission undertook to verify his entitlement to EI benefits, Mr. Puig had to prove he was capable of and available for work. The General Division found that the Commission had considered relevant factors to make its decision on availability, including details of his studies, the efforts he made to find work, and any limitations to working. It concluded that, except for the period between December 25, 2020 and January 3, 2021 and after March 1, 2021, Mr. Puig had not demonstrated his availability for work. Mr. Puig appealed a second time to the Appeal Division.\n[8] On February 22, 2023, the Appeal Division found that the General Division had misinterpreted section 153.161 of the EIA when it concluded that the provision allows for a delayed entitlement decision. It found that section 153.161 gives the Commission the discretionary authority to seek verification of entitlement after an initial entitlement decision has already been made, based on statements made in the claimant\u2019s application and ongoing reports, and after benefits were paid (AD Decision at paras. 70-71, 81, 89). If verification is sought and the Commission determines that the claimant has not demonstrated their availability for work, the Commission then has the discretion to decide, under subsection 52(1) of the EIA, whether it is going to reconsider the claim. In doing so, it must exercise its discretion judicially (AD Decision at paras. 78, 88-89).\n[9] The Appeal Division then considered whether the Commission had exercised its discretion judicially when it decided to verify Mr. Puig\u2019s entitlement and to reconsider his claim.\n[10] The Appeal Division first noted that there was no evidence that the Commission had acted in bad faith, considered irrelevant factors or ignored relevant ones, or acted in a discriminatory manner when it decided to verify Mr. Puig\u2019s entitlement to benefits. The Commission had not previously verified his availability for work and acted on relevant information that called into question his availability, namely that he was attending non-referred training (AD Decision at para. 102).\n[11] The Appeal Division then considered the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion under section 52 of the EIA, including Mr. Puig\u2019s submissions that the Commission could not retroactively reconsider a decision about availability without new facts or information and that the Commission had ignored other relevant factors. Despite noting that Mr. Puig had honestly reported his attendance in school throughout his claim period and that his debt was created through no fault of his own, the Appeal Division held that the Commission was not bound to apply its reconsideration policy given the particular circumstances under which section 153.161 was adopted (AD Decision at paras. 107-113). The Appeal Division further noted that there was no evidence demonstrating that the Commission had acted in bad faith or for an improper purpose, adding that claimants are obligated to repay benefits to which they are not entitled. The Appeal Division indicated that reconsidering a claim where it appears that a claimant may not be entitled to benefits is a proper purpose for reconsideration. The Appeal Division concluded that the Commission had exercised its discretion judicially as it had considered all the relevant information in deciding to reconsider the claim. While sympathetic to Mr. Puig\u2019s situation, the Appeal Division dismissed the appeal.\n[12] Before this Court, Mr. Puig submits that the Appeal Division unreasonably concluded that the Commission could retroactively reconsider his claim. In particular, he first challenges the Appeal Division\u2019s conclusion that the Commission does not have to follow its own reconsideration policy. Second, he argues that the Appeal Division erred in concluding that the word \u201cverify\u201d in subsection 153.161(2) of the EIA allows the Commission to retroactively reconsider his claim in the absence of any new information. Finally, he claims that the Appeal Division erred in finding that the Commission had not already verified his claim by interviewing him in October 2020, five months before imposing the overpayment.\n[13] Mr. Puig further submits, in the alternative, that the Commission did not judicially exercise its discretion in retroactively reconsidering the claim.\nII. Analysis [14] It is important to state at the outset that the present application for judicial review was heard at the same time as two other applications raising substantially similar issues (T-Giorgis v. Canada (Attorney General of Canada), 2024 FCA 47 and Molchan v. Canada (Attorney General of Canada), 2024 FCA 46). The same panel of judges heard the three applications on the same day and the same counsel represented the applicants and the Attorney General of Canada. The reasons in T-Giorgis and Molchan are being issued concurrently with these reasons. Where appropriate, I will rely on those reasons.\nA. Standard of Review [15] The parties agree that the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is reviewable on the deferential standard of reasonableness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65; T-Giorgis at para. 15; Molchan at para. 10; Page v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 169 at para. 48; Canada (Attorney General) v. Hull, 2022 FCA 82 at paras. 12-13; Hillier v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 44 at para. 12).\n[16] The framework for determining whether a decision of the Appeal Division is reasonable is set out in T-Giorgis at paragraphs 16-18 and in Molchan at paragraphs 11-13. Generally speaking, a reasonable decision is \u201cone that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker\u201d (Vavilov at para. 85).\nB. Relevant Framework [17] For the purposes of this application, it is not necessary to provide a full account of the relevant statutory and policy framework, as it is well set out in T-Giorgis at paragraphs 20-29.\nC. Reconsideration of Mr. Puig\u2019s Claim (1) Application of the Commission\u2019s Reconsideration Policy [18] Mr. Puig submits that it is unreasonable to find that reconsideration occurred under section 52 of the EIA and then conclude that the policy on reconsideration does not apply. He adds that the underlying purpose of the reconsideration policy is to prevent creating debt when the claimant has been overpaid through no fault of their own. He contends that his situation should be distinguished from the situation of claimants who were automatically transitioned from EI-ERB to regular EI benefits since the Commission had all the relevant information from the beginning of his application.\n[19] I do not find this argument persuasive.\n[20] The Appeal Division acknowledged that none of the factors in the Commission\u2019s policy justified reconsideration of Mr. Puig\u2019s claim. It noted that Mr. Puig had honestly reported his schooling throughout his claim and that the debt was created through no fault of his own. The Appeal Division observed, however, that the reconsideration policy was developed prior to the addition of section 153.161 to the EIA and does not provide any guidance on how section 153.161 should inform the Commission\u2019s discretion under section 52 of the EIA (AD Decision at paras. 108, 110). Noting that subsection 153.161(2) does not refer to verifying the accuracy of information, but refers rather to entitlement, the Appeal Division opined that the legislature specifically contemplated the possibility of the Commission reconsidering claims for students in non-referred training, even if accurate information was previously provided, in circumstances where verification is sought and the claimant cannot prove their entitlement. The Appeal Division concluded that the Commission was not obligated to apply the reconsideration policy where section 153.161 of the EIA was in play (AD Decision at paras. 112-113).\n[21] For reasons substantially similar to those set out in T-Giorgis at paragraphs 53 to 59, I have not been persuaded that the conclusion of the Appeal Division is unreasonable.\n(2) Absence of New Information [22] Mr. Puig argues that section 153.161 of the EIA does not give the Commission the power to retroactively reconsider a claimant\u2019s availability absent new information. He contends that the purpose of verification is to confirm or supplement the facts and information upon which the original decision was based, not to render a second decision based on the exact same information that was originally provided.\n[23] I disagree.\n[24] The Appeal Division considered the text of section 153.161 of the EIA, the context in which it was adopted, and its purpose. As in T-Giorgis, the Appeal Division found that section 153.161 of the EIA allows the Commission to make an initial entitlement decision based on statements made by a claimant in the application for benefits and the ongoing claimant reports, but to postpone its verification of entitlement to a later date. It further found that the Commission has the discretionary authority under subsection 153.161(2) to seek verification of entitlement after benefits were paid. If verification is sought and the Commission decides that the claimant has not proven their availability, the Commission then has the discretion under section 52 of the EIA to determine whether it is going to reconsider the claim (AD Decision at paras. 71-90).\n[25] The Appeal Division noted that section 153.161 does not refer to verification of the accuracy of information, but rather to verification of entitlement. This means, in the Appeal Division\u2019s view, that Parliament had specifically contemplated the possibility of the Commission reconsidering claims for students in non-referred training after benefits were paid, even if the claimant had provided accurate information (AD Decision at paras. 111-112).\n[26] A comparable argument was raised and dismissed in T-Giorgis at paragraphs 37 to 52. I see no reason to depart from those findings.\n(3) The October 2020 Call [27] Mr. Puig submits that the Commission had already verified his claim in October 2020. He argues that an agent of Service Canada reviewed the file, called him and interviewed him at length. In his view, it would be unreasonable to suggest that the Commission reviewed his application, conducted a full investigation regarding his reasons for separation, but then failed to turn its mind to the issue of training.\n[28] The Appeal Division found that there was no evidence of any discussion in that conversation regarding Mr. Puig\u2019s availability for work or that his availability had been verified in that conversation (AD Decision at paras. 106, 117).\n[29] The burden of demonstrating that a decision is unreasonable is on the party challenging the decision (Vavilov at para. 100). Mr. Puig has not pointed to any evidence that would demonstrate that the Appeal Division\u2019s finding is unreasonable.\nD. Judicial Exercise of Discretion [30] Mr. Puig submits, in the alternative, that the Commission did not exercise its discretion to retroactively reconsider the claim judicially. First, he contends that the Appeal Division unreasonably concluded that the Commission exercised its discretion judicially despite finding that the law had worked a real hardship in his case. Second, he argues that the Appeal Division erred in finding that the Commission had turned its mind to the relevant factors despite maintaining throughout that it was not even exercising a discretion to reconsider. Third, he maintains that the Appeal Division unreasonably concluded that both the misinformation Mr. Puig received from Service Canada and the Commission's delay in acting on information already in its possession are irrelevant to the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion.\n[31] Regarding Mr. Puig\u2019s first argument, I agree that EI benefits are meant to protect workers from hardship when they experience involuntary loss of employment. However, I do not find that it was inconsistent for the Appeal Division to find that the law has worked a real hardship in this case and to also find that the Commission exercised its discretion judicially. The Appeal Division\u2019s statement on hardship must be interpreted in its proper context.\n[32] In examining whether the Commission exercised its discretion judicially, the Commission considered Mr. Puig\u2019s arguments that he had spoken to Service Canada agents, that he understood that he could apply for benefits and that he had been approved, that he had provided all relevant information in his application, and that the Commission waited several months before acting on the information in its possession. The Appeal Division nonetheless found that there was no evidence demonstrating that the Commission had acted in bad faith, or for an improper purpose. The Appeal Division also noted that the Commission had considered all relevant information in deciding to reconsider the claim and concluded that, since the Commission had exercised its discretion judicially, it could not intervene in that decision (AD Decision at paras. 106, 109, 114-121).\n[33] The Appeal Division then recognized that Mr. Puig would be disappointed with the result, and commented on the question of hardship. It observed that \u201c[u]nfortunately, the law has worked a real hardship in [Mr. Puig\u2019s] case\u2026 [as he] acted honestly throughout yet is now left with a substantial debt\u201d (AD Decision at para. 122). While sympathetic to Mr. Puig\u2019s situation, the Appeal Division noted that it could not provide him with a remedy (AD Decision at para. 123).\n[34] In Molchan at paragraphs 40-55, I examine whether the Commission was bound to consider financial hardship in the exercise of its discretion under section 52 of the EIA. While the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion in that case was guided by the reconsideration policy, I find in Molchan that the Appeal Division\u2019s comments regarding the claimant\u2019s ability to seek a write-off of her debt are consistent with the legislation, which sets out a specific procedure for undue hardship cases. Subparagraph 56(1)(f)(ii) of the Employment Insurance Regulations, S.O.R.\/96-332 gives the Commission broad powers to write off an amount payable under section 43 of the EIA if the repayment of the amount due would result in undue hardship to the claimant. Section 43 provides that a claimant is liable to repay an amount paid by the Commission as benefits and to which the claimant was not entitled.\n[35] Consequently, as the Appeal Division noted, the authority to overwrite a debt does not lie with either the General Division or the Appeal Division. That said, Mr. Puig is not left without relief. He may ask the Commission for a write-off on the basis of financial hardship and it will be for the Commission to decide if relief is appropriate.\n[36] Regarding Mr. Puig\u2019s second argument, that the Commission could not exercise its discretion judicially if it did not know it was doing so, I am not persuaded that the Appeal Division committed a reviewable error. It is not inconsistent for the Appeal Division to conclude that the Commission judicially exercised a discretion that it did not know it was exercising, provided that the underlying discretionary analysis is conducted, even if it is not expressly recognized as an exercise of discretion. The Appeal Division found that there was no evidence that the Commission considered irrelevant factors, ignored relevant ones or acted in bad faith in deciding to verify Mr. Puig\u2019s entitlement to benefits. The Commission had acted on information calling into question Mr. Puig\u2019s availability, as he was attending a program to which he was not referred by the Commission.\n[37] The fact that the Commission does not expressly designate this analysis as an exercise of discretion does not change the fact that this analysis addresses what a discretionary analysis would address. Thus, even if Mr. Puig is correct in stating that the Commission did not know it was exercising its discretion, it remains that he has not demonstrated that the Commission\u2019s conclusion is unreasonable.\n[38] Regarding Mr. Puig\u2019s third argument, this Court found in Canada (Attorney General) v. Buors, 2002 FCA 372 and in Granger v. Canada Employment and Immigration Commission, [1986] 3 F.C. 70, 29 D.L.R. (4th) 501 (F.C.A.) (Granger), later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in Granger v. Canada (Canada Employment and Immigration Commission), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 141, that a claimant cannot rely on misinformation from the Commission or its representatives that is contrary to what is prescribed by law. I dismiss a similar argument in Molchan at paragraphs 37-39. On the issue of the delay to verify the claim, the Commission acted within the time frame imposed under the EIA. Aside from the issue of hardship which I address above, Mr. Puig has not demonstrated why it was unreasonable for the Appeal Division to find that the delay was not a relevant factor to the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion.\nIII. Conclusion [39] To conclude, despite his counsel\u2019s able submissions, Mr. Puig has failed to persuade me that the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is unreasonable. While he may not agree with the outcome, the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and is justified in relation to the facts and the law it was required to apply in the circumstances (Vavilov at para. 85). Although I am sympathetic to Mr. Puig\u2019s unfortunate situation, I am unable to find any basis upon which to intervene.\n[40] On a final note, I wish to point out that no issue was raised before this Court in relation to this Court\u2019s recent decision in Page, which held that full-time students are not systematically disentitled from receiving EI benefits and that a contextual analysis is required to ascertain whether the presumption of non-availability has been rebutted. As no argument was made regarding the basis on which the Commission found that Mr. Puig was unavailable for work, these reasons should not be read as a validation of the Commission\u2019s grounds.\n[41] For these reasons, I would dismiss the application for judicial review. The respondent did not seek costs and none will be awarded.\n\"Sylvie E. Roussel\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nDavid Stratas J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nJohn B.

MAXINE COLLINS\nAppellant\nand\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA\nRespondent\nHeard at Ottawa, Ontario, on January 10, 2024.\nOrder delivered from the Bench at Ottawa, Ontario, on January 10, 2024.\nREASONS FOR ORDER BY:\nTHE COURT\nDate: 20240110\nDocket: A-160-23\nCitation: 2024 FCA 5\nCORAM:\nSTRATAS J.A.\nLASKIN J.A.\nGOYETTE J.A.\nBETWEEN:\nR. MAXINE COLLINS\nAppellant\nand\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR ORDER\n[1] The appellant moves for an order that Stratas J.A. recuse himself from this appeal. She says that Stratas J.A. is biased against her. She relies on various directions, orders and judgments Stratas J.A. has made or concurred with in cases involving her since 2011.\n[2] On this motion, the parties have filed motion records. The parties have also made oral submissions at the outset of the hearing of this appeal. The Court has considered the parties\u2019 submissions and now can rule on the appellant\u2019s recusal motion.\nA. The principles governing a recusal motion [3] The Chief Justice assigns judges of this Court to serve on panels to hear and decide cases. The judges have no input into this decision.\n[4] In this case, consistent with the Court\u2019s standard practice, Stratas J.A. had no input into the Chief Justice\u2019s decision to assign him to this case.\n[5] From time to time, judges receive a list of the cases to which they are assigned. Stratas J.A. learned that he was assigned to this case roughly a month ago. When he was assigned to it, he had no concern about his ability to accept the assignment.\n[6] Once assigned to a matter, a judge cannot refuse the assignment or recuse, absent good legal cause.\n[7] One example of good legal cause is actual bias in favour of or against a side on all or part of the case. A judge with that mental state must recuse forthwith and refrain from being involved in it at all.\n[8] Another legal cause for recusal is if the judge is not actually biased but the circumstances are such that a reasonable, fully informed person, thinking the matter through, would conclude that it is more likely than not that a judge, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide the case fairly: Committee for Justice and Liberty et al. v. National Energy Board et al., [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369 at 394.\n[9] The two tests\u2014one for actual bias, the other for apparent or apprehended bias\u2014give voice to the fundamental principle that \u201cjustice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done\u201d: R. v. Sussex Justices, [1923] EWHC KB 1, [1924] 1 K.B. 256.\n[10] The judge against whom an allegation of actual bias is made, here Stratas J.A., is the only person who can confirm or deny the allegation. Thus, whether acting alone or on a panel, only that judge can decide the issue of actual bias.\n[11] But where, as here, the Court is comprised of three judges on a panel and where the individual judge denies the allegation of actual bias, the appearance may nevertheless be such that the judge must recuse for reasons of fairness and to maintain the reputation of the Court and the public\u2019s confidence in the administration of justice. Due to the broader sweep of apparent or apprehended bias\u2014an institutional rather than an individual concern\u2014all three judges comprising the Court must consider and determine the issue.\n[12] There is a strong presumption that judges will obey their judicial oaths and act impartially. Unwarranted allegations of judicial bias can harm the administration of justice: Es-Sayyid v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2012 FCA 59, [2013] 4 F.C.R. 3. Alleging judicial bias is \u201ca serious step that should not be undertaken lightly\u201d: R. v. S.(R.D.), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484 at para. 133.\n[13] Thus, motions such as this should be brought only where there is a \u201creal likelihood or probability of [actual or apparent] bias\u201d, supported by \u201ccogent evidence\u201d: Yukon Francophone School Board, Education Area #23 v. Yukon (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 25, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 282 at para. 25; Cojocaru v. British Columbia Women\u2019s Hospital and Health Centre, 2013 SCC 30, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 357 at paras. 22 and 27. A wholly unwarranted motion should normally be met with an enhanced award of costs.\nB. Applying the principles to this case (a) Actual bias [14] In this case, Stratas J.A. declares that he is not biased. He has sat on previous cases and motions involving the appellant and has never had nor has he developed an animus against the appellant. As for this appeal, he confirms that he is approaching it with an open, persuadable mind. He has worked hard to understand the evidentiary record and the written submissions filed to date in this appeal. He is and remains committed to reviewing the appellant\u2019s written and oral submissions carefully in light of the facts and the applicable law.\n[15] As well, Stratas J.A. confirms that he has always treated the appellant like any other litigant who appears before him: with due courtesy and fairness, interest in her submissions, and a willingness to listen and consider those submissions. The appellant has not suggested otherwise. Stratas J.A. intends to do likewise in this appeal.\n[16] Thus, Stratas J.A. rejects the appellant\u2019s allegations of actual bias.\n(b) Apparent or apprehended bias [17] As for apparent or apprehended bias, we are all of the view that the appellant\u2019s allegations and submissions have no merit.\n[18] The appellant has referred to a number of motions and appeals involving her on which Stratas J.A. has sat. She alleges that Stratas J.A. has consistently ruled against her in various matters.\n[19] One or more previous rulings by a judge against a litigant\u2014indeed, the overall win-loss record of a litigant before a judge\u2014cannot, by themselves, demonstrate apparent or apprehended bias. A reasonable, fully informed person appreciates that a judge may rule against a party on a number of occasions. And that person also appreciates that a losing streak may be justified by the facts and the law of the individual cases. See Canada (Attorney General) v.

Perciballi (2001), 146 O.A.C. 1, 54 O.R. (3d) 346 at para. 21, aff\u2019d 2002 SCC 51 at para. 1.\n[20] Here, we have reviewed the reasons offered in the various matters the appellant raises and the circumstances surrounding them. The reasons offered are not slapdash or rash. Rather, they consistently show a careful, considered and rational approach on the facts and the law.\n[21] But, in any event, the results of the appellant\u2019s matters before Stratas J.A. have not been one-sided. A review of the orders and directions involving the appellant shows that Stratas J.A. has exercised his discretion in the appellant\u2019s favour on some issues.\n[22] There is nothing in the various matters that suggests that there is an appearance or apprehension of animus or bias against the appellant. Although the appellant has not always been successful in matters involving Stratas J.A., the reasons of the Court in each matter show due and careful consideration of the appellant\u2019s submissions and decisions based on a careful and objective application of the law to the facts.\n[23] The appellant focuses on a recent ruling of Stratas J.A. It permitted the respondent to file a book of authorities even though it was late. This ruling cannot be taken to be something that could create an appearance or apprehension of bias. Judges of this Court regularly permit the late filing of authorities in the absence of prejudice. Not permitting a filing like that hurts everyone: it leaves the parties and the Court without a convenient collection of authorities to review.\n[24] The appellant\u2019s main concern is a general one about both Federal Courts. She says that they tend to believe the submissions of lawyers rather than self-represented litigants like her. That is not a ground for Stratas J.A. to recuse. There is no evidence of lack of even-handedness on Stratas J.A.\u2019s part.\n[25] Further, we are all of the view that nothing has been done in this appeal that would create an appearance or apprehension of animus or pre-judgment of the appellant\u2019s case.\nC. Disposition [26] Therefore, we will dismiss the appellant\u2019s recusal motion with costs. Costs shall be on the usual scale since the respondent did not ask for enhanced costs.\n\u201cDavid Stratas\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cJ.B.

In its judgment, the Tax Court dismissed the appellants\u2019 appeals from reassessments made under the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.).\n[2] The appellants were incorporated by Ron Bonin to carry on the business of window and railing manufacturing and installation. Mr. Bonin is the CEO and sole manager of each of the appellants.\n[3] On the advice of their tax advisor, the appellants claimed deductions for management fee expenses. The Tax Court found that there were no written or oral agreements for the provision of management services. It further found that the tax advisor determined the amounts charged each year. These amounts were not based on any measurable factors, but rather on the amount of the paying company\u2019s income. In almost all cases, invoices were issued on the last day of the paying company\u2019s taxation year. The invoices contained no detail as to the services provided or who had provided them. In response to Mr. Bonin\u2019s inquiry of the appellants\u2019 tax advisor concerning the claimed deductions, the tax advisor stated that they were \u201cokay.\u201d\n[4] The appeals to the Tax Court raised three issues: (1) whether the amounts claimed as management fees were deductible in computing income under paragraph 18(1)(a) of the ITA; (2) whether the appellants were liable for gross negligence penalties under subsection 163(2) on the basis that they were wilfully blind or grossly negligent with respect to the false statements in their claims to deduct management fees; and (3) whether reassessments of certain taxation years of some of the appellants, which would otherwise be statute-barred as falling beyond the normal reassessment period, were open to the Minister under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) because those appellants had made misrepresentations attributable to \u201cneglect, carelessness or wilful default.\u201d\n[5] The Tax Court determined that (1) the amounts claimed were not deductible; (2) the appellants were liable for gross negligence penalties; and (3) the Minister had validly opened up the taxation years in question. The appellants submit that the Tax Court erred in law in addressing each of the three issues. We can see no reviewable error.\n[6] In alleging error on the first issue, the appellants submit that the Tax Court failed to consider all the relevant facts, and confined itself to considering only Mr. Bonin\u2019s testimony and certain financial statements. The reasons of the Tax Court do not bear out this submission. The Tax Court also expressly considered, among other things, the absence of contracts for the management services, the invoices on which the appellants relied, and the evidence of a bookkeeper. Moreover, first instance courts are presumed to have considered and assessed all of the evidence before them: Mahjoub v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FCA 157 at paras. 67-69.\n[7] In challenging the decision on the second issue, the appellants acknowledge that the Tax Court recognized the correct test for wilful blindness, but submit that the Court failed to apply it. That test, as the Tax Court stated (at page 13 of its reasons), is subjective in nature, and authorizes the Court to impute knowledge to a taxpayer \u201cin circumstances where the taxpayer becomes aware of the need for inquiry but declines to make the inquiry because the taxpayer does not want to know, or studiously avoids, the truth\u201d: Wynter v. Canada, 2017 FCA 195 at paras. 13, 16; Canada v. Paletta, 2022 FCA 86 at para. 66. The Tax Court found (at pages 16 and 17 of its reasons) that the appellants made only minimal inquiries, despite the \u201cseveral red flags that ought to have aroused further suspicion and caused further inquiry.\u201d\n[8] The appellants submit that the Tax Court should have concluded, applying the correct test, that there was no wilful blindness, \u201cbecause there is no evidence that Mr. Bonin had any suspicion that the claim for management fees expense [sic] was a false statement\u201d (Appellants\u2019 memorandum, p. 11). The appellants further submit that the Tax Court erred by relying on its finding (at page 15 of its reasons) that \u201c[a] businessman like Mr. Bonin ought to have questioned further\u201d without finding actual suspicion on Mr. Bonin\u2019s part. However, this phrase, and the statement that the \u201cred flags \u2026 ought to have aroused further suspicion\u201d (emphasis added), supply the requisite finding of suspicion. While the appellants also appear to challenge the Tax Court\u2019s finding based on the weight it assigned to the evidence, it is not this Court\u2019s role on appeal to reweigh it.\n[9] Although, as the Tax Court noted, its finding on wilful blindness meant that the appellants also met the threshold for opening up an otherwise statute-barred year, it nonetheless went on to address the third issue, and the question of gross negligence.\n[10] The appellants say that, in doing so, the Tax Court failed to apply the proper test for gross negligence. They rely in particular on the statement of the test in Venne v. The Queen, 1984 CanLII 5717 (FC), [1984] C.T.C. 223. But the Tax Court specifically referred to Venne, and the Tax Court\u2019s statement of the test is both not inconsistent with Venne and consistent with this Court\u2019s more recent statements; see, for example, Wynter at paras. 18-21 and Paletta at paras. 65-68. Indeed, in the specific part of the Tax Court\u2019s statement of the test with which the appellants take issue, at page 18 of its reasons, the Court recites verbatim this Court\u2019s statement of the test in another recent decision, Deyab v. Canada, 2020 FCA 222 at para. 62. We see no reviewable error in the Tax Court\u2019s statement of the test for gross negligence.\n[11] For these reasons, we will dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\u201cJ.B.

It also sought to join the class, despite the deadline to opt in to the class action having passed. The Federal Court dismissed its request to intervene and to join the class (Tk'eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation v. Canada, 2023 FC 237, 2023 A.C.W.S. 647).\n[2] The judge disposed of the motion in writing and prior to receipt of the respondents\u2019 motion records. Salt River appeals on grounds relating to both the manner in which its motion was determined and the substance of the decision. The respondents\u2014the representative plaintiffs (Gottfriedson respondents) and the Attorney General of Canada\u2014argue that the Federal Court did not err in dismissing Salt River\u2019s motion, in either the process followed or in the reasons provided for its decision. The respondents also argue that the appeal is in any event moot, as the Federal Court\u2019s decision approving the settlement was not stayed and the settlement funds have been transferred to the trust established to manage the settlement funds in accordance with its terms.\n[3] Both Salt River and the Gottfriedson respondents seek to adduce fresh evidence on this appeal. While the fresh evidence is not dispositive of an issue in the appeal, for reasons that will become clear, it should be admitted. It provides essential information relating to the grounds of appeal and the question of mootness. The Gottfriedson respondents had no opportunity to put their evidence before the Federal Court prior to its disposition of the motion and none of the parties are prejudiced by its admission.\nThe class action and settlement agreement\n[4] The underlying class proceeding was certified in 2015 (Gottfriedson v. Canada, 2015 FC 706, [2015] F.C.J. No. 698). In broad terms, the action was brought by the representative plaintiff Bands seeking compensation for losses of Indigenous culture, language and social cohesion arising from the residential schools system. Uniquely in the context of class actions, and at the request of the Bands, the Band class claims proceeded on an opt-in basis. The Band class included \u201cany\u2026 Indian Band(s) that: (i) has or had some members who are or were Survivors, or in whose community a Residential School is or was located; and (ii) is specifically added to this claim in relation to one or more specifically identified Residential Schools\u201d (Federal Court decision at paras. 2-3).\n[5] A Federal Court judge was assigned to case manage the proceeding.\n[6] In 2022, the judge issued two orders extending the opt-in periods for Bands; on February 8, 2022 the opt-in period was extended until May 31, 2022, and on June 15, 2022, the opt-in period was further extended until June 30, 2022. These orders included steps to be taken by class counsel to provide notice of the extensions to Bands not already in the class, including posting the extended deadline on the dedicated class action website and emailing all Bands known to class counsel who had not yet opted in (Federal Court decision at paras. 5-7).\n[7] The reasons why the deadlines were extended twice are significant. The discovery of unmarked graves at the sites of former residential schools had a dramatic effect on the course of the litigation. Counsel described this as \u201ca game changer\u201d and advised the Federal Court that there was now a renewed interest in the class proceeding and that Bands needed time to assess and digest the implications of these discoveries on many levels, not just legal. Consequently, the deadlines were extended and new Bands were allowed to join the class.\n[8] After the June 30, 2022 deadline expired, six additional First Nations were granted leave to join the class in August 2022, and the Huron-Wendat were granted leave by the Court in September 2022. The seven Bands were let in following the deadline on consent, by agreement between class counsel and counsel for the Attorney General. No motion records nor supporting affidavits were filed.\n[9] The common issues trial began on September 12, 2022, and was scheduled to last 48 days. The parties subsequently requested an adjournment, and on September 20, 2022, the trial was adjourned to allow for settlement negotiations.\n[10] On January 18, 2023, a settlement was reached: the Government of Canada agreed to pay $2.8 billion to a trust fund administered by a not-for-profit entity. The funds were to be distributed by the trust to Bands in support of the \u201cFour Pillars\u201d of the settlement agreement: a) revival and protection of Indigenous languages; b) revival and protection of Indigenous cultures; c) protection and promotion of heritage; and d) wellness for Indigenous communities and their members. Two hundred thousand dollars was allocated to each Band to allow them to develop a plan as to how their share of the settlement funds would be spent. A list of the Band class members formed part of the agreement. There were 325 Band class members.\n[11] The settlement approval hearing took place on February 27 and 28, 2023. The Federal Court approved the settlement for reasons released on March 9, 2023 (Tk'eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation v. Canada, 2023 FC 327, 2023 CarswellNat 605 [Settlement Approval decision]). Three months later, on June 8, 2023, Canada settled the trust by transferring the settlement funds to the administering entity, and it is on this basis that the respondents contend the appeal is moot.\nSalt River\u2019s involvement in the class action\n[12] Salt River is a band under the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5. It is situated in the Northwest Territories, near the Alberta border. Its claim that it meets the first criterion for inclusion in the Band class, and thus that it would have been able to opt in prior to the deadline, is not disputed.\n[13] Salt River states that it was unaware of the class action and the opt-in requirement until late January 2023, when its Acting Chief was shown a news article about the settlement. Following a search of the former Chief\u2019s office and of all Band Council meeting minutes and resolutions for the past three years, Salt River was not able to find any notice of the proceeding or of the opt-in requirement. It claims that its ignorance of the class action was due to its limited administrative capacity and the health issues of its former Chief, with the Chief holding the only full-time position on Salt River\u2019s Council.\n[14] Shortly thereafter, on February 13, 2023, Salt River filed a notice of motion to intervene in the imminent settlement approval hearing. It did not request that the motion be dealt with in writing under rule 369 of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106. The motion was to be heard February 21, 2023. Salt River\u2019s motion was supported by several affidavits indicating that it had not received notice of the class action.\n[15] On February 15, 2023, the Gottfriedson respondents wrote to the Court to advise that they would be responding to the motion. They began drafting a responding affidavit and written representations to be served and filed in accordance with the deadlines in the Federal Courts Rules (i.e. two days before the motion was to be heard, per rule 365(1)(a)).\n[16] Two days later, on February 17, 2023, the Federal Court judge dismissed the motion, prior to receiving the responding materials and without an oral hearing.\n[17] Salt River appealed the order dismissing its motion for leave to intervene and join the class, but did not move to stay the settlement approval hearing pending disposition of its appeal.\nThe Federal Court decision\n[18] In dismissing Salt River\u2019s motion to intervene, the judge first noted that while Salt River was technically seeking intervener status in the class proceeding, it was in substance seeking to be added to the class. The judge then held that Salt River could not now opt in to the class, since it had not opted in by the twice-extended deadline of June 30, 2022. The judge noted that she was \u201csatisfied\u201d that class counsel took the steps set out in the Court\u2019s deadline extension orders to communicate the extended deadlines to potential Band class members across Canada (Federal Court decision at para. 8). The judge did not explain the basis upon which this conclusion was reached.\n[19] The judge also dismissed Salt River\u2019s request for intervener status. Citing the test from Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Canadian Council for Refugees, 2021 FCA 13, 481 C.R.R. (2d) 234 [Canadian Council], the judge concluded that Salt River was not directly affected by the outcome of the class proceeding, and that in any event, any interest raised by Salt River would be adequately represented at the settlement approval hearing by the other Band class members. The judge noted that Salt River\u2019s proposed challenge to the validity of the opt-in regime had not been raised by the parties in the context of the class action, as the only issue before the Court at the upcoming hearing would be whether the proposed settlement agreement was in the best interests of the class members (Federal Court decision at paras. 14-16).\n[20] Finally, the judge held that Salt River\u2019s intervention would not be in the interests of justice due to Salt River\u2019s delay in seeking intervener status, the impending settlement hearing, and the disruption and prejudice to parties if Salt River were allowed to intervene. The judge was also not satisfied that Salt River provided any reasonable explanation for its delay, given the \u201cextensive outreach by Class counsel to all Indian Bands known to Canada and Class counsel\u201d, as well as \u201cextensive media coverage\u201d of the proceeding (Federal Court decision at para. 20).\nIssues before us\n[21] Salt River contends that the Federal Court\u2019s failure to hold an oral hearing, despite one being requested and the importance of the issues, amounted to a breach of procedural fairness. The other two errors alleged by Salt River relate to the substance of the decision itself; more particularly, Salt River argues that the judge erred in applying a bright-line rule in considering whether it could opt in after the deadline, and secondly, in denying its motion to intervene. Salt River contends that the Court erred in concluding that it did not have a genuine interest in the proceeding as a potential class member.\n[22] Salt River seeks to have the Federal Court\u2019s order set aside, as well as an order granting it leave to intervene and to join as a class member. In the alternative, Salt River seeks to have this matter remitted to the Federal Court for a hearing.\n[23] The Attorney General and the Gottfriedson respondents argue that the judge did not err in disposing of the motion in writing, given the powers conferred on case management judges by rules 384.1 and 385 of the Federal Courts Rules as well as the general powers of the Court under rule 3 of the Federal Courts Rules. The Gottfriedson respondents argue that an oral hearing was not required as a matter of natural justice here, especially given the judge\u2019s familiarity with the matter.\n[24] The Gottfriedson respondents also argue that there was no error in the Court\u2019s decision to deny the motion to intervene and\/or to deny Salt River\u2019s request to join the class. The Gottfriedson respondents note that as an intervener, Salt River was precluded from raising any issue beyond whether the settlement was fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of the class (Gottfriedson Respondents\u2019 Memorandum of Fact and Law at paras. 51-52, citing Tsleil-Waututh Nation v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FCA 174, 414 D.L.R. (4th) 373). The question of whether Salt River could join the class should not be before the Court. The Gottfriedson respondents emphasize that the judge cited the correct legal test for intervention, and that her decision, as case management judge, is entitled to deference.\n[25] Finally, the Gottfriedson respondents argue that there was no error in denying Salt River entry to the class. They argue that the judge did not have the jurisdiction to do so on Salt River\u2019s motion, since the Court\u2019s jurisdiction on the settlement approval hearing was limited to approving or denying the settlement agreement as it stood. They contend that even if the Court had the necessary powers, it would not be in the best interests of the Band class, nor favourable to the integrity of the process, to add Salt River to the class at this stage. Denying Salt River entry into the class also would not prejudice Salt River as it would retain its rights against Canada.\nThe fresh evidence motion\n[26] The Gottfriedson respondents bring a motion to admit fresh evidence on this appeal. They seek leave to admit the evidence that they would have put before the judge on the motion below, had she not dealt with the motion without hearing from them. This evidence deals mainly with the steps taken by class counsel to provide notice of the class action to Bands across Canada (including Salt River), and evidence that the trust has now been settled (which came to be after the settlement approval hearing). The Attorney General takes no position on this motion.\n[27] Salt River does not oppose the fresh evidence motion, however, it seeks to introduce evidence in response to the fresh evidence of the Gottfriedson respondents. Specifically, Salt River seeks to introduce an affidavit from class counsel dated January 12, 2022, which explains why the Gottfriedson respondents sought to reopen the opt-in period and provide further notices to potential class members. The affidavit notes that the discovery of unmarked graves brought renewed interest in the class action and, importantly for the purposes of this appeal, that the previously published notice was confusing. This evidence therefore explains why certain Bands may not have initially opted in. Salt River also seeks to introduce evidence that shows that it was unable to find a record of the email notice of the class action sent by class counsel (Appellant\u2019s Supplemental Motion Record on Fresh Evidence Motion at pp. 2 and 19).\n[28] Importantly, Salt River observes that the fresh evidence of the Gottfriedson respondents does not contradict the fact that it did not become aware of this class action until January 2023 (Appellant\u2019s Written Representations on Fresh Evidence Motion at para. 8).\nThe fresh evidence should be allowed in\n[29] The test for fresh evidence on appeal was set out in Bell Canada v. Adwokat, 2023 FCA 106, 2023 CarswellNat 1503 at para. 4 [Adwokat]: it must be established that the evidence \u201c(1) could not have been adduced at trial with the exercise of due diligence; (2) is relevant in that it bears on a decisive or potentially decisive issue on appeal; (3) is credible in that it is reasonably capable of belief; and (4) is such that, if believed, could reasonably have affected the result in the [C]ourt below.\u201d Even where these criteria are not met, a court has limited residual discretion to admit new evidence on appeal where the interests of justice require it (Adwokat at para. 4).\n[30] Regarding the parties\u2019 due diligence, this criterion is obviously met for the evidence that only came into existence after the motion. However, it is also satisfied for the other evidence, which existed at the time of the motion but which was not before the Federal Court due to the Court choosing, of its own initiative, to decide the matter early and on the basis of Salt River\u2019s materials only. The due diligence criterion is not solely temporal\u2014rather, it focuses on the conduct of the parties (Barendregt v. Grebliunas, 2022 SCC 22, 469 D.L.R. (4th) 1 at para. 59). Both parties here acted with due diligence in preparing and submitting their materials, but were cut off at the pass, so to speak. Therefore, under the unique circumstances of this case, the evidence could not have been adduced in the Court below with the exercise of due diligence.\n[31] The proposed fresh evidence is relevant and credible: it is relevant to the issues of adequacy of notice, Salt River\u2019s reasons for missing the opt-in deadline, and the issue of mootness. Nor is there any reason to doubt its credibility: the evidence is uncontroversial and mostly supported by documentation.\n[32] The final criterion\u2014whether the evidence would have affected the result in the Court below\u2014presents difficulties. The Gottfriedson respondents seek to admit evidence that they say only reinforces the decision below, or that speaks to what the judge can be assumed to have known when she reached the conclusion that she was \u201csatisfied\u201d that notice had been sent to Salt River. Salt River, in contrast, seeks to contextualize the Gottfriedson respondents\u2019 evidence. In my view, the evidence submitted could conceivably have affected the outcome below.\n[33] Based on the above analysis, the evidence can be admitted under both the traditional test, as well as the broader interests of justice test. It is sufficient to say that the Adwokat criteria have been met, but it is also in the interests of justice that this Court has a full record before it. Salt River\u2019s fresh evidence is directly responsive to that of the Gottfriedson respondents and the motions were not opposed by either party. I would allow both motions to adduce fresh evidence.\nWhether the appeal is moot\n[34] The first question to be determined is whether the appeal is moot since the settlement approval hearing has taken place, the settlement has been approved, the approval order is final and has not been appealed, and the settlement has been implemented.\n[35] A matter is moot where there is no longer a live controversy which affects the rights of the parties (Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), 1989 CanLII 123 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342 at 353 [Borowski]). That is the case here. The settlement funds have been settled in the trust and the settlement approval order has not been stayed. The Attorney General has no further role in the proceeding.\n[36] There are, however, a number of reasons why this Court should exercise its discretion and entertain the appeal. Borowski provides that a court, in determining whether to hear a case that is moot, can consider the existence of an adversarial context, the concern for the judicial economy and the role of the court as an adjudicative branch in the political framework (at 358-363). Here, there is a robust adversarial relationship between the parties and the issues have been fully argued before us. Judicial economy is not in play, as the mootness argument was essentially woven into the fresh evidence motion and the substantive questions on appeal. These factors aside, it is in the interests of justice that the Court consider the substantive issue. As the circumstances here demonstrate, there is value in giving appellate guidance to judges considering whether to approve class action settlements.\nError in deciding the motion in writing\n[37] I begin with a review of some basic principles.\n[38] First, the standard of review for an allegation of procedural unfairness is functionally correctness: a court must ask whether the procedure was fair having regard to all of the circumstances (Mission Institution v. Khela, 2014 SCC 24, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 502 at para. 79; Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Canada, 2018 FCA 69, [2018] F.C.J. No. 382 at para. 54). For an alleged error of fact-finding, the standard is palpable and overriding error. A court can take into account the motion judge\u2019s role as case management judge in its analysis (see, for example, Paradissis v. Canada, 2019 FCA 70, 303 A.C.W.S. (3d) 881 at para. 6, citing Turmel v. Canada, 2016 FCA 9, 481 N.R. 139).\n[39] Second, a court is not required to hold an oral hearing in disposing of a motion.\n[40] In dealing with class actions, case management judges are given wide powers under the Federal Courts Rules, including the power to \u201cgive any directions or make any orders that are necessary for the just, most expeditious and least expensive outcome of the proceeding\u201d, per rule 385(1)(a). Judges are also authorized to deal with motions in writing under rule 369 of the Federal Courts Rules, and can exercise their discretion to do so based on the nature of the motion, the evidence, the issues, and the arguments (Adams v. Canada (Parole Board), 2022 FC 273, 2022 W.C.B. 494 at para. 19). Finally, this Court recently held in ViiV Healthcare Company v. Gilead Sciences Canada, Inc., 2021 FCA 122, 460 D.L.R. (4th) 272, that a court can act on its own initiative when confronted with a \u201cproblematic motion\u201d, though it should not be quick to do so, and it must always invite submissions and consider them (at paras. 22-27). I hasten to add that there was nothing problematic about Salt River\u2019s motion. It was promptly brought upon Salt River becoming aware of the proceeding and substantially in proper form (despite it being framed as an intervention motion, when it was in substance a motion to be added to the class, as the judge properly recognized).\n[41] Wide as the discretion of a case management judge may be, it is not unlimited. There are other factors that bear on how it should be exercised, and in this case those include the nature of the issues, the allegations, and, importantly, the expectations of the parties as to how their case will be presented. Put otherwise, counsel may present a much different argument if they know that the motion is to be disposed of in writing only. Here, all parties proceeded on the understanding that there would be an oral hearing with respect to Salt River\u2019s motion.\n[42] The nature of the evidence put before the Court by Salt River also constrained its exercise of discretion. Representatives of Salt River averred, under oath, that they had not received notice of the class action. This was a serious matter.\n[43] Class counsel contend that the judge was entitled to rely on her familiarity with the case and assume that the notices that the Court had directed to be sent were in fact sent and reached their recipients.\n[44] As a general proposition I agree, but again, there are limits. That assumption cannot be relied on in the face of sworn evidence to the contrary. While the judge does not say so directly, it is implicit in her reasons that she did not believe Salt River\u2019s affiants. The judge\u2019s reliance on the proposition that all that was to have been done, had in fact been done, was undermined by the uncontroverted evidence that the notice of the proceeding had not been received. Therefore, the Federal Court erred in making findings of fact not supported by the evidence before it on the motion: namely, that class counsel had effectively communicated the opt-in deadline to potential Band class members, including Salt River, contrary to Salt River\u2019s affidavits asserting the opposite. I note, parenthetically, that the fresh evidence clarifies that while notice had been sent to Salt River, it was unaware of the proceeding.\n[45] Finally, there are circumstances where an oral hearing is required. For the reasons that the judge expressed in the Settlement Approval decision, this settlement was historic in nature and designed to address decades of cultural assimilation through the residential school system. If Salt River was to be denied the opportunity to participate in this settlement, it should have had the right to make the oral submissions that both it and the Federal Courts Rules contemplated and that the parties requested and anticipated. To this I would add that the judge did not consider the overarching objective of reconciliation in deciding to render the decision on the motion in writing and without the benefit of full submissions.\n[46] The judge therefore erred in deciding the matter in writing and without hearing from the parties.\n[47] This finding would be sufficient to conclude this matter; however, there are other concerns with respect to the Federal Court\u2019s treatment of Salt River\u2019s attempt to join the class.\nWhether Salt River could join the class\n[48] I do not accept that Salt River\u2019s failure to opt in by the deadline, on its own, constituted a sound discretionary basis for refusing Salt River\u2019s motion to be added to the class. The judge erred in law in her approach to the issue and her exercise of discretion cannot be sustained in light of the facts.\n[49] Beginning with the law, the judge did not consider the jurisprudence with respect to whether a party should be allowed to opt in after the deadline. (I am assuming that there was, in fact \u201ca deadline\u201d, given the multiple and unexplained extensions and its fluid nature.) Had the Court directed itself to the jurisprudence, it might have reached a different conclusion.\n[50] Where a settlement amount is fixed, a court should apply a balancing test (considering factors such as prejudice to the parties and the reason for delay) in determining whether a potential class member should be allowed to join the class after the relevant deadline (Harrington v. Dow Corning Corp., 2001 BCSC 221, 84 B.C.L.R. (3d) 368 at para. 22; Boys and Girls Club of London Foundation c. Molson Coors Brewing Co., 2010 QCCS 6306, [2010] Q.J. No. 14108 at paras. 10-11; and Gregg v. Freightliner Ltd., 2012 BCSC 415, [2012] B.C.W.L.D. 3314 at para. 73 [Gregg]; see also Johnson v. Ontario, 2022 ONCA 725, 475 D.L.R. (4th) 344 at para. 52).\n[51] The Court in Gregg noted that, save for situations where a judge has become functus, \u201cthe jurisprudence does not appear to endorse an absolute bar on\u2026 extending the time to opt-in after a settlement agreement has been reached\u201d, pointing to a court\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in advancing the goals of class actions (at para. 64). This applies with particular force in the context of a class action addressing the harms caused to Indigenous culture by residential schools with the objective of reconciliation.\n[52] I find it difficult to determine why the Federal Court denied Salt River class status. The only reason given by the judge appears to be that Salt River was out of time. The judge does not address what distinguishes Salt River from the other Bands allowed to join after the deadline (Federal Court decision at paras. 10-12). In addressing Salt River\u2019s request for intervener status, the principal factors apparently motivating the judge\u2019s decision were Salt River\u2019s delay in bringing the motion to opt in and prejudice to the class arising from a delay of the approval of the settlement (Federal Court decision at paras. 15-20).\n[53] The uncontroverted evidence confirms the assertion that Salt River did not know of the class action until late January 2023, and it acted promptly upon learning of it. The judge, however, does not grapple with the question of whether Salt River\u2019s delay to join the class was excusable.\n[54] Insofar as the timing of Salt River\u2019s motion was concerned, it will be recalled that the class action commenced in 2015. In September 2022, the common issues trial commenced and was scheduled to last approximately 10 weeks, with the damages portion of the trial set to proceed at a later date (Settlement Approval decision at para. 15). Other Bands were added to the class before trial began in August and September 2022 on the basis of no evidence at all\u2014simply on the consent of counsel. The settlement itself was only announced January 18, 2023. There was evidence before the judge that Salt River did not become aware of the action until January of 2023. Further, there is no consistency in the treatment accorded to Bands that were allowed to join after the expiry of the opt-in period and Salt River which was not, and no explanation was provided by the Federal Court for its lack of consistency in its treatment of would-be class members.\n[55] The hearing date for the settlement approval was entirely within the judge\u2019s control. Salt River\u2019s request could have been fairly considered had there not been a precipitous rush to have a settlement approval hearing on the date originally set. In exercising discretion with respect to scheduling decisions, judges must have an eye to the efficient administration of justice. But there is a strong countervailing principle, and that is that efficiency must not come at the expense of ensuring fairness to the parties.\n[56] The judge seemed to proceed on the basis that the settlement approval hearing was an immovable target and did not consider whether Salt River\u2019s motion to join could have been heard prior to the settlement approval hearing. The February 27 date was an arbitrary one, entirely in the discretion of the judge to move.\n[57] Nor did the judge explicitly consider the prejudice to Salt River if it was not allowed to join the class. The judge reasoned that since Salt River was not a member of the Band Class, it would not be directly affected by the outcome of the proceeding. This implies that Salt River would not be prejudiced by the Federal Court\u2019s decision, since Salt River would retain its rights against Canada.\n[58] The judge erred in giving this any weight. It took eight years to reach this settlement, involving 325 Bands; how a single, small Band could achieve a proportionate outcome is, at best, conjecture. While Canada said in its submissions that it was \u201copen\u201d to reach a similar accommodation with Salt River, this Court notes that over a year has transpired since the settlement approval and no accommodation has been reached, nor is there any evidence that steps have been taken in this regard.\nThe motion to intervene\n[59] At the risk of repetition, the judge erred in deciding the matter without holding an oral hearing. Again, as noted earlier at paragraph 47, while this is sufficient to conclude the matter, the Federal Court\u2019s consideration of Salt River\u2019s request to intervene requires comment. It is readily apparent that there were palpable and overriding errors in the application of the test by the judge.\n[60] The judge erred in finding that Salt River would not be directly affected by the outcome of the settlement approval hearing and also simultaneously finding that Salt River\u2019s interests would be adequately represented by the Band class members who had opted in.\n[61] It is obvious that Salt River would be directly affected by the outcome of the settlement approval hearing: it met the requirements to opt in to the Band class (which does not appear to be contested) and, absent a stay pending appeal, the approval of the settlement effectively put an end to its ability to join the class. Additionally, the conclusion that Salt River\u2019s interests could be sufficiently represented by class members cannot be sustained. It is, on its face, illogical: existing class members\u2019 interests would be diametrically opposed to Salt River\u2019s, as Salt River\u2019s inclusion may reduce the settlement funds available to all other class members.\n[62] The only possible outcomes of the settlement approval hearing were the denial or approval of the settlement. However, in making that decision, a judge is required to consider expressions of support and objections and communications with class members during litigation (see Settlement Approval decision at para. 49). Given the unique circumstances of this action\u2014an opt-in class action\u2014this could have encompassed consideration of the adequacy of notice to Salt River.\n[63] None of the parties to the settlement agreement had any interest in discussing the question of whether Salt River had received notice or should be a member of the class, and to this extent, Salt River could be characterized as having raised a new issue. Nevertheless, these were questions central to the settlement approval hearing itself, and in respect of which the judge had an obligation to be satisfied in determining whether the settlement was in the best interests of the class. Criticisms of communications between class counsel and class members, for example, can encompass both the content of the communications sent to class members, as well as the efforts deployed by class counsel to distribute such communications (Lin v. Airbnb, Inc., 2021 FC 1260, 2021 CarswellNat 5129 at para. 52). This factor would be particularly relevant in cases such as this, where questions had been raised as to the effectiveness of the notices. Additionally, the objective of this settlement and its asserted historic significance should have been taken into account by the case management judge.\nConclusion\n[64] As noted, the settlement funds have been transferred to the trust and no interim relief was sought to stay the settlement approval decision or the implementation of the settlement pending Salt River\u2019s appeal. Apart from the Federal Court\u2019s limited continuing supervisory jurisdiction over its administration, the action is at an end and the judge is functus. Despite the errors identified, there is no executory order that this Court can issue which would rectify the judgment of the Federal Court and I would therefore dismiss the appeal without costs.\n\u201cDonald J.

WALKER J.A.\nDate: 20240321\nDocket: A-204-21\nCitation: 2024 FCA 55\nCORAM:\nGLEASON J.A.\nBIRINGER J.A.\nWALKER J.A.\nBETWEEN:\nSHELLEY WEPRUK\nApplicant\nand\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nBIRINGER J.A.\n[1] The applicant seeks judicial review of a decision of the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board, 2021 FPSLREB 75 (Board Reasons). The Board dismissed the applicant\u2019s grievance, upholding the employer\u2019s termination decision.\n[2] At the hearing in this Court, the applicant moved to exclude an affidavit filed by the respondent, on the basis that it was fresh evidence. The brief affidavit contains exhibits including the decision under review, interim decisions by the Board, the Board\u2019s decision relating to a separate staffing grievance, the employer\u2019s speaking points for the Board hearing, and exhibits presented to the Board, not all of which were included in the applicant\u2019s record. The applicant\u2019s concern that this is fresh evidence is without merit, as the material is not new. I would dismiss the motion.\n[3] The applicant worked at Health Canada from 2002 to 2014. In July 2014, following her manager\u2019s refusal of a leave request, the applicant wrote an email to her bargaining agent representative indicating that one day soon she would \u201csnap\u201d and commit violence towards her manager.\n[4] Following an administrative investigation and a disciplinary hearing, the applicant\u2019s employment was terminated for cause. The Board considered the applicant\u2019s termination grievance afresh, including oral and documentary evidence offered by the applicant and the employer, and declined to overturn the employer\u2019s decision.\n[5] The standard of review for the Board\u2019s decision is reasonableness: Walker v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FCA 44 at para. 2 [Walker]; Samson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 212 at para. 2.\n[6] As the Supreme Court held in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov], \u201ca reasonable decision is one that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker\u201d: para. 85. A reasonableness review is not a treasure hunt for error; any shortcomings in the decision must be sufficiently central or significant to warrant intervention: Vavilov at paras. 100 and 102.\n[7] The focus of a reasonableness review is on the decision actually made and whether it is unreasonable. The reviewing court does not \u201credo\u201d the analysis that the decision maker did to determine what the court might have decided in the circumstances: Vavilov at para. 83.\n[8] The applicant also raises procedural fairness arguments. The standard of review for procedural fairness is best described as correctness, and the ultimate question is whether the applicant knew the case to meet and had a full and fair chance to respond: Watson v. Canadian Union of Public Employees, 2023 FCA 48 at para. 17; Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 at paras. 54 and 56.\n[9] In my view, the Board\u2019s decision was reasonable, and its process was fair.\n[10] In determining whether the applicant\u2019s termination was justified, the Board applied the well-established framework from William Scott & Co. v. C.F.A.W., Local P-162, 1976 CarswellBC 518, [1977] 1 Can. L.R.B.R. 1 [William Scott], asking whether there were grounds for discipline and, if so, whether the penalty imposed was appropriate: Walker at para. 4; Basra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 FCA 24 at para. 24; Toronto (City) Board of Education v. O.S.S.T.F., District 15, 1997 CanLII 378 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 487 at para. 49.\n[11] As the applicant conceded that her misconduct warranted discipline, the Board\u2019s analysis focused on the appropriateness of termination as a consequence. The Board properly recognized that threats of violence do not automatically justify termination, and that it had to consider both aggravating and mitigating factors, as it did: Board Reasons at paras. 263 and 265.\n[12] The applicant argues that the Board failed to properly take into account her evidence of workplace bullying and harassment and the significant impact that it had on her state of mind. I disagree.\n[13] A harassment grievance and other grievances filed by the applicant had been dismissed or settled and withdrawn prior to the Board hearing. Accordingly, the Board was not charged with determining whether there had been harassment as defined by the employer\u2019s policy or the law. The Board did, however, consider whether the applicant\u2019s perception of harassment and a toxic work environment were mitigating factors in its William Scott analysis: Board Reasons at para. 128.\n[14] The Board carefully considered the evidence, finding that the applicant\u2019s belief that she was harassed was credible and reasonable, as was the evidence of a toxic work environment. However, the Board could \u201conly go so far\u201d in assigning weight to these as mitigating factors without medical evidence of a diminished mental state: Board Reasons at paras. 299 and 301. The Board determined that there had been no immediate provocation and that the applicant\u2019s state of mind did not justify a threat of violence or mitigate the seriousness of the misconduct, such that it could set aside the employer\u2019s termination decision: Board Reasons at para. 303.\n[15] The Board\u2019s conclusion was based on its factual findings and a weighing of the aggravating and mitigating factors. Absent exceptional circumstances, this Court must refrain from reweighing and reassessing the evidence before the Board: Vavilov at para. 125. The applicant has not shown that the Board fundamentally misapprehended, or failed to account for, the facts. Rather, the Board\u2019s reasons show that it meaningfully grappled with the evidence of harassment and the applicant\u2019s state of mind, which was and remains the cornerstone of the applicant\u2019s case.\n[16] The Board\u2019s decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints. There is no basis for this Court to intervene.\n[17] Turning to the applicant\u2019s procedural fairness arguments, the applicant submits that she was denied discovery in the Board proceedings and not provided with a transcript of the proceedings. The applicant also takes issue with the order of the proceedings and being subject to the burden of proof in establishing mitigating factors in the William Scott analysis. The latter is well-established in the case law: Wilson v. Treasury Board (Solicitor General Canada \u2013 Correctional Service), [1995] C.P.S.S.R.B. No. 23 at para. 18; King v. Deputy Head (Canada Border Services Agency), 2010 PSLRB 31 at para. 186, aff\u2019d 2012 FC 488, aff\u2019d 2013 FCA 131.\n[18] Concerning the applicant\u2019s other procedural fairness arguments, I note that the applicant was represented by counsel before the Board. No request for discovery was made, and the parties agreed with the order of proceedings. There is no requirement for a transcript of the Board\u2019s proceedings. Importantly, the Board\u2019s reasons show that the applicant fully understood the case that she had to meet and had a full and fair opportunity to respond. There are no procedural unfairness concerns warranting this Court\u2019s intervention.\n[19] At the Board hearing, the applicant requested anonymization of the decision, which the Board refused. I see no reviewable error in the Board\u2019s decision on this issue, for which it gave detailed reasons: Board Reasons at paras. 13-25. It was open to the Board to reach its conclusion based on the circumstances of the proceeding before it and the open court principle. The Board\u2019s decision also accords with the Board\u2019s Policy on Openness and Privacy: Board Reasons at para. 19.\n[20] For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the application for judicial review. As the respondent has withdrawn its request for costs, none shall be awarded.\n\u201cMonica Biringer\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nMary J.L.

ROBERT CHAD\nAppellant\nand\nMINISTER OF NATIONAL REVENUE\nRespondent\nDealt with in writing without appearance of parties.\nOrder delivered at Ottawa, Ontario, on March 21, 2024.\nREASONS FOR ORDER BY:\nLOCKE J.A.\nDate: 20240321\nDocket: A-333-23\nCitation: 2024 FCA 56\nPresent: LOCKE J.A.\nBETWEEN:\nS. ROBERT CHAD\nAppellant\nand\nMINISTER OF NATIONAL REVENUE\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR ORDER\nLOCKE J.A.\nI. Background [1] This decision comes in the context of an appeal from a decision of the Federal Court (2023 FC 1481, per Justice Martine St-Louis) that struck, without leave to amend, an amended notice of application filed by the appellant, S. Robert Chad. The Federal Court found that the application was so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success.\n[2] Mr. Chad now moves for an Order determining the content of the appeal book. He proposes a list of several documents, including (i) an affidavit in his name affirmed on May 10, 2023 (the Chad Affidavit) and relied on as his affidavit evidence pursuant to Rule 306 of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R\/98-106, in the now-struck application before the Federal Court, and (ii) a certified transcript of the hearing before the Federal Court held on October 30, 2023 that led to the decision under appeal (the Transcript).\n[3] The respondent, the Minister of National Revenue (the Minister), opposes Mr. Chad\u2019s motion only in respect of the Chad Affidavit and the Transcript. The Minister argues that the Transcript should be excluded as a whole, and the Chad Affidavit should likewise be excluded, but with the exception of Exhibit 7 thereof, which is a demand letter from Mr. Chad dated November 1, 2022 (the Demand Letter).\n[4] The parties appear to agree that the content of the appeal book is to be determined in accordance with Rules 343(2) and 344(1), and jurisprudence related thereto. Rule 343(2) provides that the appeal book should include \u201conly such documents, exhibits and transcripts as are required to dispose of the issues on appeal.\u201d Rule 344(1) provides as follows:\n344 (1) An appeal book shall contain, on consecutively numbered pages and in the following order,\n344 (1) Le dossier d\u2019appel contient, sur des pages num\u00e9rot\u00e9es cons\u00e9cutivement, les documents ci-apr\u00e8s dans l\u2019ordre suivant :\n(a) a table of contents describing each document;\na) une table des mati\u00e8res d\u00e9signant chaque document;\n(b) the notice of appeal and any notice of cross-appeal;\nb) l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019avis d\u2019appel incident;\n(c) the order appealed from, as signed and entered, and any reasons, including dissenting reasons, given in respect of that order;\nc) l\u2019ordonnance port\u00e9e en appel, telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e et inscrite ainsi que les motifs, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, y compris toute dissidence;\n(d) the originating document, any other pleadings and any other document in the first instance that defines the issues in the appeal;\nd) l\u2019acte introductif d\u2019instance, les autres actes de proc\u00e9dure et tout autre document d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans la premi\u00e8re instance qui d\u00e9finit les questions en litige dans l\u2019appel;\n(e) subject to subsection (2), all documents, exhibits and transcripts agreed on under subsection 343(1) or ordered to be included on a motion under subsection 343(3);\ne) sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), les documents, pi\u00e8ces et transcriptions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans l\u2019entente vis\u00e9e au paragraphe 343(1) ou dans l\u2019ordonnance qui en tient lieu;\n(f) any order made in respect of the conduct of the appeal;\nf) toute ordonnance relative au d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019appel;\n(g) any other document relevant to the appeal;\ng) tout autre document pertinent;\n(h) an agreement reached under subsection 343(1) as to the contents of the appeal book or an order made under subsection 343(3); and\nh) l\u2019entente vis\u00e9e au paragraphe 343(1) ou l\u2019ordonnance qui en tient lieu;\n(i) a certificate in Form 344, signed by the appellant\u2019s solicitor, stating that the contents of the appeal book are complete and legible.\ni) le certificat \u00e9tabli selon la formule 344, sign\u00e9 par l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant et attestant que le contenu du dossier d\u2019appel est complet et lisible.\nII. The Transcript [5] The Minister objects to the inclusion of the Transcript in the appeal book because it contains only legal argument, and is not required to dispose of the issues on appeal: Collins v. Canada, 2010 FCA 128 at para. 2. Mr. Chad argues that the Minister tendered evidence at the hearing during her submissions, to which Mr. Chad objected, and that the Transcript is therefore not limited to legal argument. The Minister counters that the alleged evidence was simply submissions in reply to Mr. Chad\u2019s argument that a request for information under the Access to Information Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1, would not be an adequate alternative remedy.\n[6] Mr. Chad argues that the limitation on the content of the appeal book contemplated in Rule 343(2) is a flexible one, and a document should be included if a party \u201chas a reasonable basis for believing that it may wish to rely on that document to support one of its argument on appeal.\u201d Mr. Chad cites Bojangles' International, LLC v. Bojangles Caf\u00e9 Ltd., 2006 FCA 291 at para. 6, in support of this argument, but he takes the quoted passage further than was intended. It was not intended to override the principle that the document in question must be required to dispose of the issues on appeal. The mere fact that a party may wish to rely on a document cannot be sufficient.\n[7] I agree with the Minister that the Minister\u2019s submissions in question at the hearing were not evidence. Moreover, there is no indication that they were treated as such by the Federal Court. The issue of whether a request for information under the Access to Information Act would be an adequate alternative remedy is a question of law. The Transcript is not required to decide that issue; nor am I convinced that it is required to decide any other issue on appeal.\n[8] I accept Mr. Chad\u2019s argument that doubt as to whether a document should be included in the appeal book should be resolved in favour of inclusion (West Vancouver v. British Columbia, 2005 FCA 281 at para. 4), but I have no doubt that the Transcript should not be included.\nIII. The Chad Affidavit [9] The Minister objects to the inclusion of the Chad Affidavit in the appeal book, with the exception of the Demand Letter, because it was not put before the Federal Court by either party in its motion record, and was not relied on as evidence. The Minister acknowledges that Mr. Chad referred to his affidavit in his written submissions before the Federal Court, but notes that he did not include it in his motion record. The Minister also notes that Mr. Chad\u2019s counsel acknowledged explicitly at the hearing before the Federal Court that he was not relying on the Chad Affidavit as evidence.\n[10] Moreover, the Minister notes that, in the context of a motion to strike a notice of application, the facts therein are taken to be true: Canada (National Revenue) v. JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc., 2013 FCA 250 at para. 52. Therefore, no evidence is required to support those facts, either before the Federal Court or before this Court.\n[11] Mr. Chad argues that his affidavit is required to counter the Minister\u2019s submission, which was accepted by the Federal Court, that the amended notice of application \u201clargely includes bald and speculative allegations and conclusory statements which cannot support the relief sought\u201d. Mr. Chad argues that he relies on his affidavit not for the truth of its contents, but as proof that the allegations were not unsupported.\n[12] In my view, Mr. Chad\u2019s argument cannot overcome the following facts (i) evidence is not required on a motion to strike, (ii) the Chad Affidavit was not submitted as evidence in the parties\u2019 motion records, and (iii) Mr. Chad explicitly acknowledged that he was not relying on the Chad Affidavit as evidence.\n[13] The Minister acknowledges that the Demand Letter should be included in the appeal book because it is referred to in the amended notice of application in issue. In reply, Mr. Chad argues that the Minister\u2019s acknowledgement of the relevance of the Demand Letter to the present appeal must operate as an acknowledgement of the relevance of the rest of the Chad Affidavit. As he puts it, \u201c[w]hat is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\u201d I find that expression misplaced in this context. It might apply if somehow the Minister\u2019s case would be favoured by the inclusion of the Demand Letter in the appeal book, but I see no indication of that. In my view, the inclusion of the Demand Letter in the appeal book is not in dispute, but the inclusion of the rest of the Chad Affidavit is.\n[14] I agree with the Minister that the bulk of the Chad Affidavit should be excluded from the appeal book because it is not in evidence. The Demand Letter should be included because its inclusion is not in dispute and because it is referred to in the amended notice of application.\nIV. Conclusion [15] For the foregoing reasons, I will order that the appeal book include the documents proposed by the Minister as listed in Schedule A to her responding motion record. I will also order that Mr. Chad pay the Minister\u2019s costs of this motion in any event of the cause.\n\"George R.

HECKMAN J.A.\nDate: 20240321\nDocket: A-175-23\nCitation: 2024 FCA 57\nCORAM:\nWEBB J.A.\nWOODS J.A.\nHECKMAN J.A.\nBETWEEN:\nNOEL SINCLAIR\nAppellant\nand\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nWEBB J.A.\n[1] Mr. Sinclair, a Crown prosecutor in Whitehorse, Yukon, applied to the Public Service Commission of Canada (the PSC) on January 5, 2021 for permission to seek the nomination as (and if successful to be) a candidate in the 2021 Yukon territorial election. On March 16, 2021, the PSC denied Mr. Sinclair\u2019s request.\n[2] The election was held on April 12, 2021 and three days later on April 15, 2021, Mr. Sinclair filed an application with the Federal Court for judicial review of the decision of the PSC denying him permission to seek nomination as, and be, a candidate in that election. Mr. Sinclair, in his notice of application for judicial review, stated that he was seeking the following:\n1. An order setting aside the PSC decision and declaring that the Applicant was entitled to seek nomination and be a candidate the Yukon territorial election held on April 12, 2021;\n2. In the alternative, an order setting aside the PSC decision and remitting the matter back to the PSC for redetermination in accordance with any directions provided by this Court;\n3. The costs of this application; and\n4. Such further and other relief as this Honourable Court deems just.\n[3] The Federal Court (per Sadrehashemi J., 2023 FC 750) found that Mr. Sinclair\u2019s application was moot based on the test as set out in Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), [1989] 1 SCR 342, 57 DLR (4th) 231 (Borowski). The election for which he was seeking to be a candidate was held before he made his application for judicial review. In this appeal, Mr. Sinclair does not challenge the finding that his application was moot.\n[4] In Borowski, the Supreme Court of Canada identified the relevant criteria to be considered by a court in deciding whether to exercise its discretion to decide a matter that is moot:\n(a)the existence of an adversarial relationship between the parties;\n(b)the concern for judicial economy; and\n(c)the need for the court to be sensitive to its adjudicative role.\n[5] The Federal Court Judge considered these factors and declined to exercise her discretion to decide the application for judicial review. Mr. Sinclair\u2019s application was therefore dismissed. In this appeal, Mr. Sinclair challenges this decision of the Federal Court Judge to decline to exercise her discretion to decide his application for judicial review.\n[6] In my view, the Federal Court Judge did not commit any error that would warrant our intervention in declining to exercise her discretion to decide Mr. Sinclair\u2019s judicial review application, based on the record that was before her. This is sufficient to dismiss this appeal.\n[7] Mr. Sinclair submitted that he is seeking statements of general principles from this Court that could be applied to any future decision of the PSC on an application by a public prosecutor for permission to be a candidate in an election.\n[8] I would note that guidance has already been provided by this Court in Taman v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FCA 1 (Taman) on what is to be addressed, from an administrative law perspective, in a decision of the PSC regarding a request by a public prosecutor to be a candidate in an election.\n[9] Guidance has also been provided by the Supreme Court in Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest v. Northwest Territories (Language, Culture and Employment), 2023 SCC 31 (CSFTNO) (and the other decisions of the Supreme Court referred to therein) concerning the application of Charter rights and values in administrative decisions.\n[10] It was not contested in this appeal that decisions by the PSC refusing to grant public servants permission to seek elected office must be justified to the applicants (Taman at para. 47; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653 at para. 95) and must reflect a proportionate balancing of their Charter rights or the values underlying them (CSFTNO at para. 73).\n[11] It is far from clear what other general guidance could be provided by this Court. The Federal Court Judge, in paragraph 15 of her reasons, referred to three declarations that Mr. Sinclair was seeking:\ni) the PSC\u2019s decision disproportionately impacted his Charter rights;\nii) with the exception of the DPP [Director of Public Prosecutions] and the Deputy Directors of Public Prosecutions, federal Crown prosecutors are presumptively permitted to seek nomination and\/or run as candidates in federal, provincial, or territorial elections; and\niii) prior to issuing any decision contrary to that presumption, the PSC must refer that determination to this Court under subsection 18.3(1) of the Federal Courts Act, RSC, 1985, c F-7 on the issue of whether the PSC\u2019s proposed disposition disproportionately impacts the prosecutor\u2019s Charter rights.\n[12] The first declaration relates directly to the PSC decision that is the subject of Mr. Sinclair\u2019s judicial review application. Since his application was moot and the Federal Court Judge did not exercise her discretion to decide his application even though it was moot, this requested declaration did not warrant any further consideration by the Federal Court Judge.\n[13] Neither one of the other two declarations arise from the PSC decision nor are they identified as requested declarations in Mr. Sinclair\u2019s notice of application. These requested declarations are general declarations that Mr. Sinclair is seeking to have applied in a future decision of the PSC. The Federal Court Judge found that these requested declarations were not appropriate and Mr. Sinclair has not established that the Federal Court Judge erred in making this finding.\n[14] There is one matter that was raised in argument that warrants a comment. The PSC in its decision found that a sufficient mitigating factor could not be identified for two specified risks to the perception of political impartiality that could result from granting Mr. Sinclair\u2019s request. In particular, the PSC referred to the risk stated as \u201creputational concerns related to the role of Crown prosecutors\u201d. It is not clear whether this statement is limited to Mr. Sinclair\u2019s role as a Crown prosecutor in Whitehorse or to all Crown prosecutors.\n[15] Any decision under the Public Service Employment Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22, ss. 12, 13 (the PSEA) to grant or deny permission for a public servant, who is otherwise eligible to be a candidate in an election, is to be based on the facts and circumstances related to that particular person. A blanket prohibition on any Crown prosecutor seeking to be a candidate in an election would not be consistent with the purpose of Part 7 of the PSEA: \u201cto recognize the right of employees to engage in political activities while maintaining the principle of political impartiality in the public service\u201d (section 112 of the PSEA).\n[16] I would dismiss the appeal. Since the parties agreed that the successful party would be entitled to $3,000 in costs, I would award the respondent costs fixed in the amount of $3,000.\n\u201cWyman W.

In that decision, the Minister confirmed her intention to revoke Sigma Chi\u2019s registration as a charity.\n[2] Sigma Chi was registered as a charity with effect from 1992. It describes itself as an international fraternal organization with 244 active undergraduate chapters and 152 alumni chapters across Canada and the United States. When it was registered, one of its stated objectives was to \u201cassist deserving undergraduate, graduate, and other students attending or enrolled at institutions and systems of higher education in Canada who are in financial need to continue and complete their education at such institutions and systems.\u201d\n[3] An organization must meet a number of statutory requirements to qualify and continue to qualify for charitable registration. In 2010 and 2011, the Canada Revenue Agency audited Sigma Chi\u2019s operations. The audit identified a number of areas of non-compliance. These included Sigma Chi\u2019s failure to devote all of its resources to charitable activities and the provision of personal benefits to members. The audit found that eligibility for the majority of Sigma Chi\u2019s scholarships was restricted to its members.\n[4] In March 2011, the Minister and Sigma Chi entered into a compliance agreement to address issues identified in the audit. In the agreement, Sigma Chi agreed, among other things, to \u201cdevote all of its resources to charitable activities,\u201d and to not restrict its scholarships and financial assistance to Sigma Chi members.\n[5] The CRA commenced a second audit in November 2017. The Minister informed Sigma Chi of findings from the audit that Sigma Chi was not complying with statutory requirements, including by failing to devote its resources to its own charitable activities, failing to maintain adequate books and records, and issuing non-compliant tax receipts. The audit also found that in the 2015 and 2016 fiscal periods respectively, 61% and 74% of total resources spent on scholarships and awards were for \u201cinhouse scholarships,\u201d which are restricted to members and pledges, and that some scholarships were awarded based on the recipient\u2019s role in Sigma Chi or how they represented its ideals. The audit determined that Sigma Chi\u2019s activities were primarily for the benefit of its members, not for the benefit of the public (as the ITA requires of a registered charity).\n[6] Sigma Chi provided written representations to the Minister in response to the audit. After considering these representations, the Minister determined that Sigma Chi did not meet the requirements for registration as a charity, and issued a notice of intention to revoke. Sigma Chi filed an objection in response. The Minister reviewed Sigma Chi\u2019s submissions in support of its objection, but found that they failed to demonstrate that Sigma Chi met the requirements for maintaining its registration. However, she decided in light of the objection that she would not continue to rely on one of the grounds she had initially advanced\u2014the failure to meet the requirements for books and records in subsection 230(2) of the ITA.\n[7] The Minister now relies on three grounds for revocation: (1) that Sigma Chi has provided private benefits for members, and thus has not been operated exclusively for charitable purposes as required by paragraph 149.1(1)(a) of the ITA; (2) that it has provided funds to non-qualified donees, contrary to paragraph 149.1(1)(a.1); and (3) that it did not have direction and control over funds sent to an American organization, and thus failed to devote all of its resources to charitable activities it itself carried on, contrary to paragraph 149.1(1)(a.1): Canadian Committee for the Tel Aviv Foundation v. Canada, 2002 FCA 72 at para. 40.\n[8] Sigma Chi contests all three of these findings. It is common ground that the standard of review in respect of these findings is the highly deferential standard of palpable and overriding error, and that to displace the Minister\u2019s decision based on them, Sigma Chi must demonstrate palpable and overriding error in respect of all three: Colel Chabad Lubavitch Foundation of Israel v. Canada (National Revenue), 2022 FCA 108 at paras. 49, 51. Sigma Chi also submits that the Minister breached her duty of procedural fairness, and that her conduct raises a reasonable apprehension of bias. We do not agree that any of these grounds are made out.\n[9] First, we see no palpable and overriding error in the finding that Sigma Chi has provided private benefits to its members through its inhouse scholarships. While Sigma Chi submits that these scholarships are open to all male university students eligible to apply for Sigma Chi membership, they are ultimately payable only to recipients who are accepted as members or pledges. Moreover, despite Sigma Chi\u2019s commitment in the compliance agreement to \u201cdevote all of its resources to charitable activities\u201d and to not restrict the beneficiaries of the scholarships and educational assistance program, the record shows that it continued to grant inhouse scholarships in 2015, 2016, 2020, and 2021. In 2015 and 2016 respectively, 75% and 82% of Sigma Chi\u2019s scholarship funds were restricted to Sigma Chi members and pledges. In 2020 and 2021, Sigma Chi awarded $216,760 in inhouse scholarships. The Minister also points out that, at the time of its registration, Sigma Chi\u2019s stated purpose of assisting students pursuing higher education made no mention of any restriction to members or pledges. But as recently as May 2023, Sigma Chi stated on its website that \u201c[t]he Foundation exists as a vehicle for local Active Chapters, Alumni Chapters and\/or House Corporations to raise tax-deductible funds for educational purposes\u2014primarily for the benefit of Active Chapters and Active brothers\u201d (emphasis added). This is not a charitable purpose under the ITA.\n[10] Second, we also see no reviewable error in the Minister\u2019s finding that Sigma Chi has provided funds to non-qualified donees by making loans to Sigma Chi fraternity housing corporations, established to provide housing to members. In addition, it breached the compliance agreement by failing to obtain security for its loans to London Sigma Chi Properties and by making a further advance to London Sigma Chi Properties, despite its obligations under the compliance agreement. The loans and advance to London Sigma Chi Properties involved significant sums. According to the first audit, the loans totaled $403,015. The further advance was of $25,000.\n[11] Third, we see no reviewable error in the Minister\u2019s conclusion that Sigma Chi failed to maintain direction and control over the Horizon Scholarship program, a program partially funded by Sigma Chi and administered in the United States. As the Minister points out, Sigma Chi has only one of the eight seats on the governing board, and only two of 16 on the selection committee. There was ample support in the record for the Minister\u2019s conclusion that Sigma Chi did not have direction and control over the use of its funds.\n[12] Finally, in our view, Sigma Chi has failed to make out a reasonable apprehension of bias, and there was no deprivation of procedural fairness.\n[13] The test for establishing a reasonable apprehension of bias is whether a reasonable and informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, and having thought the matter through, would think it is more likely than not that the decision maker, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly: Yukon Francophone School Board, Education Area #23 v. Yukon (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 25 at para. 20. There is a \u201chigh burden\u201d on the party seeking to establish a reasonable apprehension of bias: Yukon Francophone at para. 26. Sigma Chi\u2019s grounds for claiming a reasonable apprehension of bias fail to meet this high burden.\n[14] Sigma Chi submits that the Minister\u2019s conduct raises a reasonable apprehension of bias because she treated Sigma Chi in a manner dissimilar to other organizations that restrict their scholarships to a subset of the public. Sigma Chi mentions scholarships offered by the University of Toronto that are restricted to students enrolled at Trinity College. However, as this Court has held in the tax context, the fact that others benefitted from an exemption is \u201cnot relevant\u201d to whether a particular taxpayer should benefit from that same exemption: R. v. Sinclair, 2003 FCA 348 at para. 7. Even if comparisons were relevant, the record before us falls well short of providing an evidentiary basis on which the Court could draw meaningful comparisons.\n[15] Sigma Chi also submits that the Minister\u2019s refusal to consider Sigma Chi\u2019s offers to take corrective measures grounds a reasonable apprehension of bias. However, as the Minister notes, Sigma Chi was given three formal opportunities to respond to the issues identified by the Minister. The record before us shows that Sigma Chi\u2019s submissions were taken seriously, and were thoroughly reviewed and considered. We agree with the Minister that Sigma Chi was not entitled to continuously negotiate further corrective measures, especially given its failure to meet its obligations under the compliance agreement.\n[16] For these reasons, we will dismiss the appeal, with costs fixed, in accordance with the parties\u2019 agreement, at $5,000 all-inclusive.\n\u201cJ.B.

MAXINE COLLINS\nAppellant\nand\nTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\n(Delivered from the Bench at Ottawa, Ontario, on January 10, 2024).\nGOYETTE J.A.\n[1] The appellant appeals from an order of the Federal Court (per Fuhrer J) dismissing her motions: 2023 FC 863.\n[2] The relevant facts are as follows.\n[3] On February 8, 2022, the appellant filed a statement of claim with the Federal Court, alleging that employees of Canada Post were interfering with her mail, in violation of sections 48 and 49 of the Canada Post Corporation Act, R.S.C. 1985 c. C-10. The appellant\u2019s action came within the regime for simplified actions provided for in Rules 292 to 299.42 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106 (Rules).\n[4] The respondent did not file a statement of defence. Instead, on March 11, 2022, the respondent filed a motion to strike the appellant\u2019s statement of claim pursuant to Rule 221.\n[5] On April 21, 2023, Associate Judge Molgat (Associate Judge) dismissed the respondent\u2019s motion to strike because (1) the motion was brought out of time, and (2) the respondent had failed to file material necessary for the hearing of the motion.\n[6] The appellant appealed the Associate Judge\u2019s decision to a judge of the Federal Court through a Rule 51 motion. Previously, the appellant had filed a Rule 210 motion seeking default judgment against the respondent for having failed to file a statement of defence. The Federal Court dismissed both these motions.\n[7] The Federal Court exercised its discretion conferred under Rule 210 to dismiss the appellant\u2019s motion for default judgment for two reasons. First, the appellant had failed to provide any supporting evidence as required by Rule 210(3). The Federal Court found that the appellant\u2019s affidavit of service did not qualify as supporting evidence, that is, evidence supporting her statement of claim: Trimble Solutions Corporation v. Quantum Dynamics Inc., 2021 FC 63 at para. 35; Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Verdegem, 2013 FC 50 at para. 2. Second, the respondent had shown interest in the matter.\n[8] As mentioned, a decision on a Rule 210 motion is discretionary. Accordingly, this Court\u2019s intervention is justified only if the Federal Court made an error of law, an error on an extricable question of law, or a palpable and overriding error on a factually suffused question of fact or mixed fact and law: Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, 2016 FCA 215 at paras. 66-69; Canada v. Preston, 2023 FCA 178 at para. 12. We have carefully reviewed the appellant\u2019s arguments as well as the record, and we have found no such errors. Thus, we disagree with the appellant that the Rules prevented the respondent from filing a motion to strike her statement of claim. As for the conflict between the Federal Court\u2019s reasons and the order, paragraph 11 makes it clear that the dismissal of the motion for default judgment is without prejudice to the appellant\u2019s right to bring a further motion for default judgment with proper supporting affidavit evidence. In our view, the Federal Court\u2019s order should be read as implementing paragraph 11.\n[9] We now turn to the appellant\u2019s Rule 51 motion appealing the Associate Judge\u2019s decision to dismiss the respondent\u2019s motion to strike. The Federal Court noted that it could only intervene if the Associate Judge had made an error of law or a palpable and overriding error on a question of fact or mixed fact and law. The Federal Court rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that the Associate Judge had made such an error by rendering her order following Rule 298(2)(b) instead of Rule 221. According to the Federal Court, the wording of the Associate Judge\u2019s order made it clear that it was addressing the respondent\u2019s motion brought pursuant to Rule 221. The Federal Court also determined that the Associate Judge\u2019s consideration of Rule 298 was appropriate as this Rule provides limitations with respect to motions to strike on simplified actions such as the appellant\u2019s.\n[10] Before this Court, the appellant raises numerous allegations concerning the proper interpretation of Rules 221 and 298 and the interaction between these two Rules. After careful consideration of these allegations, we find that they do not support the conclusion that the Federal Court made a reversible error: Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at paras. 6-37.\n[11] As acknowledged in Sa\u2019d v. Yew, 2023 FC 1286, there is a difference between motions to strike pleadings that rely on the ground in Rule 221(1)(a) and those that rely on the grounds in Rule 221(1)(b) to (f). However, this difference has no impact on the outcome of this case. The fact that Rules 221(1)(a) and 298(2) required the respondent to bring his motion to strike the appellant\u2019s statement of claim on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action within the time set in Rule 204, while Rules 221(1)(b) to (f) and Rule 298(1) required him to bring his motion to strike based on other grounds at a pre-trial conference does not change the conclusion that the respondent\u2019s motion to strike was out of time and not accompanied by the necessary material. Either way, no error warrants this Court\u2019s intervention.\n[12] Before disposing of this appeal, we wish to note that the Appellant has not followed the proper procedural channels to raise a systemic discrimination claim. Therefore, this Court cannot rule on this claim.\n[13] For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\"Nathalie Goyette\"\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-160-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nR.

MACTAVISH J.A.\nDate: 20240321\nDocket: A-101-22\nCitation: 2024 FCA 60\nCORAM:\nLASKIN J.A.\nMACTAVISH J.A.\nMONAGHAN J.A.\nBETWEEN:\nJOSEPH PILARSKI\nAppellant\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nMONAGHAN J.A.\n[1] The appellant, Joseph Pilarski, appeals the Tax Court of Canada\u2019s April 28, 2022 procedural order (per Bocock, J) in Tax Court File 2015-355(IT)G. That order adjourned the oral hearing of the respondent\u2019s motion to quash the appellant\u2019s appeal, and ordered that the motion be determined based on written representations. That is, the Tax Court\u2019s order changed the oral hearing to a written hearing.\n[2] The Tax Court\u2019s order is discretionary, meaning that the Tax Court can decide. When an appellant appeals a discretionary order, such as this one, this Court reviews the order on the appellate standards from Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33: Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, 2016 FCA 215 at paras. 66, 79; Canada v. Preston, 2023 FCA 178 at para. 12. Accordingly, we can interfere with the Tax Court\u2019s order only if it made an error of law or a palpable and overriding error on a question of fact or mixed fact and law. A \u201cpalpable\u201d error is one that is obvious; an \u201coverriding error\u201d is an error that goes to the core of the outcome: Benhaim v. St-Germain, 2016 SCC 48 at para. 38, citing South Yukon Forest Corp. v. R., 2012 FCA 165 at para. 46.\n[3] The appellant says that, when it adjourned the hearing of the motion, the Tax Court could not order the motion to be determined based on written representations without his consent.\n[4] I disagree. The Tax Court did not err in changing the manner in which it would hear the motion.\n[5] The Tax Court scheduled an in-person hearing twice at the appellant\u2019s request. However, each time, the appellant asked for and was granted an adjournment because of medical conditions. After the first adjournment, the parties agreed to have the motion decided based on written representations. However, the appellant later changed his mind, seeking an oral hearing. While the Tax Court offered a hearing by teleconference, the appellant insisted on an in-person hearing. The Tax Court scheduled one, but again, at the appellant\u2019s request, the Tax Court adjourned it and issued the order under appeal, noting that the motion was suitable for decision based on written representations.\n[6] There is no right to an oral hearing for a motion. The Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure), SOR\/90-688a expressly permit motions to be determined based on written representations and without appearance of the parties in person: Rule 69. What is important is that the parties have an opportunity to put their submissions before the decision maker. Here, the parties previously made written submissions, and the Tax Court expressly invited them to file further written materials before it decided the motion.\n[7] Before us, the appellant said the Tax Court\u2019s decision to decide the motion in writing prejudiced him because his health conditions limit his ability to deal with written material.\n[8] Both the Tax Court and this Court have a duty to ensure that litigants with disabilities are accommodated, to ensure that they receive the same level of procedurally fair justice as that accorded to other Canadians: Haynes v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 158 at paras. 18-32. That said, individuals with disabilities have an obligation to help secure appropriate accommodation: Haynes at para. 30; Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970, 95 D.L.R. (4th) 577 at 994. There is no evidence before us that the appellant ever advised the Tax Court that it would be difficult for him to process and respond to, or to provide, written representations and other written material.\n[9] The Tax Court also has an obligation to act in a manner that secures the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every proceeding on its merits: Rule 4(1). When the Tax Court made its order, the respondent\u2019s motion had been before the Court for seven years. It merits a decision. Satisfied the motion was suitable to be decided in writing, and after repeated, but unsuccessful, efforts to hold an in-person hearing, the Tax Court\u2019s decision was well within its discretion. I see no error that would permit us to interfere with it.\n[10] At the hearing of this appeal, the respondent withdrew the request for costs. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal without costs.\n\"K.A. Siobhan Monaghan\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nJohn B. Laskin J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nAnne L.

Rule 334.39 provides as follows:\nNo costs\nSans d\u00e9pens\n334.39 (1) Subject to subsection (2), no costs may be awarded against any party to a motion for certification of a proceeding as a class proceeding, to a class proceeding or to an appeal arising from a class proceeding, unless\n334.39 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), les d\u00e9pens ne sont adjug\u00e9s contre une partie \u00e0 une requ\u00eate en vue de faire autoriser l\u2019instance comme recours collectif, \u00e0 un recours collectif ou \u00e0 un appel d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un recours collectif, que dans les cas suivants :\n(a) the conduct of the party unnecessarily lengthened the duration of the proceeding;\na) sa conduite a eu pour effet de prolonger inutilement la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019instance;\n(b) any step in the proceeding by the party was improper, vexatious or unnecessary or was taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution; or\nb) une mesure prise par elle au cours de l\u2019instance \u00e9tait inappropri\u00e9e, vexatoire ou inutile ou a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re n\u00e9gligente, par erreur ou avec trop de circonspection;\n(c) exceptional circumstances make it unjust to deprive the successful party of costs.\nc) des circonstances exceptionnelles font en sorte qu\u2019il serait injuste d\u2019en priver la partie qui a eu gain de cause.\nIndividual claims\nR\u00e9clamations individuelles\n(2) The Court has full discretion to award costs with respect to the determination of the individual claims of a class member.\n(2) La Cour a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019adjuger les d\u00e9pens qui sont li\u00e9s aux d\u00e9cisions portant sur les r\u00e9clamations individuelles de membres du groupe.\n[4] This Court did not consider Rule 334.39 in rendering the decisions on costs and it is open to us to reconsider that part of the judgments (and reasons) pursuant to subsection 397(2) of the Rules: Siddiqui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FCA 237 at paras. 20-21; Le Corre v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 238 at paras. 6-8.\n[5] The \u201cno costs\u201d regime applicable to class proceedings, while generally designed to assist plaintiffs in their access to justice, applies to all parties: Wenham v. Canada, 2020 FC 592 at para. 13, aff\u2019d 2021 FCA 208 at paras. 19-20.\n[6] Rule 334.39 applies as soon as parties to the action are made parties to a certification motion: Campbell v. Canada, 2012 FCA 45 at para. 45; Mohr v. National Hockey League, 2022 FCA 145 at para. 76.\n[7] The parties in this motion are parties to the Hudson certification motion, which was served on October 5, 2020. There is no certification motion in Pierrot v. Canada. Counsel agreed to hold the action in abeyance if Hudson proceeds and, accordingly, Pierrot has been stayed pending a final determination in Hudson: Canada v. Hudson, 2024 FCA 33 at para. 21.\n[8] Subsection 334.39(2) of the Rules is not relevant. Further, there is no reason to apply any of the exceptions contained in paragraphs (a) through (c) of subsection 334.39(1).\n[9] Rule 334.39(1) applies to the Hudson parties. While Rule 334.39(1) is not, strictly speaking, engaged in respect of the Pierrot parties, given the reasons for the matter being stayed, it would be inappropriate to depart from the \u201cno costs\u201d regime. Moreover, the plaintiffs in both Hudson and Pierrot did not mention costs in their submissions to this Court. Accordingly, none should be awarded: Chen v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FCA 170 at para. 60; Exeter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 FCA 134 at para. 12.\n[10] For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the motion, delete the words \u201cwith costs\u201d, and replace them with the words \u201cwithout costs\u201d in the Court\u2019s judgments and reasons (at paragraph 93), dated February 20, 2024.\n\u201cMonica Biringer\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nWebb J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nRennie J.A.\u201d\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKETS:\nA-16-23 and A-15-23\nDOCKET:\na-16-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING v.

Background [1] In the present appeal from a judgment of the Tax Court of Canada, the appellant moves for an Order that:\n1. The Court grant the appellant leave to adduce fresh evidence pursuant to Rule 351 of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106, as follows:\na. The appellant\u2019s personal tax returns and the respondent\u2019s assessments thereof for the relevant taxation years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011;\nb. The derivative corporate taxpayer\u2019s tax returns and the respondent\u2019s assessments thereof for the relevant taxation years 2007 and 2008;\nc. The letter of Dr. L. Raynor dated April 29, 2021;\nd. The medical certificate from Dr. L. Raynor dated April 21, 2011;\ne. The B.C. Minister of Finance document in the possession of the respondent\u2019s counsel which confirms that Factory Marine Distribution was, in fact, owned by Western Import Manufacturing Distribution Group Ltd.;\nf. Canada Revenue Agency circular T4001 (E) entitled Employers Guide - Payroll Deductions and Remittances;\ng. Canada Revenue Agency GST\/HST Policy Statement P-237;\nThe respondent amend and supplement the appeal book by including:\na. The transcripts of the Tax Court trial held on February 19, 2019, October 25, 2019 and March 22, 23 and 24, 2022;\nb. The omitted Tax Court Exhibits R-2 and R-3;\nc. All documents and exhibits provided to the court during Tax Court trial proceedings;\nd. Any or all of the documents that the Court deems admissible;\n3. The parties to this appeal be accorded a reasonable opportunity to amend their respective memoranda of fact and law accordingly;\n4. The appellant\u2019s previously disqualified court support person, Mr. Tinkham, be reinstated.\n[2] The respondents consents to the motion to the following extent:\n1. Including the Tax Court hearing transcripts and Exhibits R-2 and R-3 in a supplemental appeal book;\n2. Preparing the supplemental appeal book (while leaving the appellant responsible for ordering and paying for the transcripts); and\n3. Permitting the parties to amend their memoranda of fact and law.\n[3] The respondent opposes the introduction of fresh evidence, as well as the reinstatement of Mr. Tinkham. The respondent adds a request for an Order that regularizes the fact that a single notice of appeal was filed in respect of two different matters that were before the Tax Court.\n[4] I have also received and considered the appellant\u2019s reply to the respondent\u2019s submissions on the motion, as well as a letter requesting an extension of time to file an amended reply and permission to file an additional affidavit on this motion. I understand that letter request to be in response to an argument by the respondent that the appellant\u2019s affidavit #2 in support of her motion contains argument and irrelevant facts, and should be disregarded. Having considered this argument, I have concluded that the appellant\u2019s affidavit #2 should not be disregarded. To the extent that that affidavit contains argument, I will treat it is as such. Accordingly, I understand that there is no need to act on the appellant\u2019s letter request, and the motion is now ready to be decided.\n[5] Before examining the issues in dispute in this motion, a little background may be helpful. The Tax Court decision under appeal was rendered on May 30, 2022, and the notice of appeal was filed in this Court on June 30, 2022. Because of the lack of progress in the appeal by the following March, the Court sought input from the parties on advancing it. By Order dated May 12, 2023, having received and considered the parties\u2019 input, the Court put in place a timetable of steps in the appeal, and ordered the respondent to prepare the appeal book. The respondent prepared and filed the appeal book, but the appellant felt that some documents were missing. By Direction dated February 1, 2024, again noting the lack of progress in the appeal, the Court directed that, if the appellant felt any documents were missing from the appeal book, she should make a formal motion in that regard. This is the motion currently before the Court.\nII. Fresh Evidence [6] The parties agree that a party seeking to adduce fresh evidence must establish that the evidence: (1) could not have been adduced at trial with the exercise of due diligence; (2) is relevant in that it bears on a decisive or potentially decisive issue on appeal; (3) is credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief; and (4) is such that, if believed, could reasonably have affected the result in the court below; and that, if the evidence fails to meet the foregoing criteria, the Court still possesses a residual discretion to admit the evidence on appeal, though such discretion should be exercised sparingly and only in the clearest of cases, where the interests of justice so require (see Coady v. Canada (Royal Mounted Police), 2019 FCA 102 at para. 3).\n[7] The respondent argues that the proposed fresh evidence should be refused for the following reasons:\n1. In respect of the tax returns, the appellant and Mr. Tinkham were made aware of the importance of these documents during the evidence phase of the trial before the Tax Court, but made no attempt to introduce them into evidence until the stage of closing arguments;\n2. In respect of Dr. Raynor\u2019s letters (which appear to be dated April 21, 2011 and February 8, 2019), the Tax Court excluded them as inadmissible hearsay, and the appellant did not call Dr. Raynor as a witness; the respondent also argues that the February 8, 2019 letter lacks credibility in that it went beyond medical opinion into advocacy;\n3. In respect of the B.C. Minister of Finance document, it could have been adduced at trial with the exercise of due diligence;\n4. In respect of the CRA publications, these are authorities, not evidence.\n[8] The respondent argues that the appellant has not met the requirements for the introduction of any of the proposed fresh evidence, and this is not one of the clearest of cases where the Court should exercise its residual discretion in the interests of justice.\n[9] With regard to the tax returns, the appellant cites difficulties finding them. She adds that she attempted to adduce them as evidence prior to the commencement of closing arguments. With regard to Dr. Raynor\u2019s letters, the appellant argues that she was unable to call Dr. Raynor as a witness because she (Dr. Raynor) went on an extended vacation shortly after providing her February 8, 2019 letter, and then retired upon her return. The appellant also alleges that the Tax Court judge initially indicated that Dr. Raynor\u2019s letters could be introduced through the appellant\u2019s testimony. With regard to the B.C. Minister of Finance document, the appellant disagrees that it could have been adduced at trial with the exercise of due diligence. With regard to the CRA publications, the appellant appears to accept that she can refer to them as authorities rather than evidence.\n[10] I agree with the respondent that fresh evidence pursuant to Rule 351 should not be allowed. The appellant was aware of the importance of the tax returns and Dr. Raynor\u2019s letters and has not convinced me that she exercised due diligence in introducing them into evidence. She points to a trial exhibit as evidence of Dr. Raynor\u2019s vacation, but she does not point to any exchange with the Tax Court in which she asserted the necessity of relying on Dr. Raynor\u2019s letters as hearsay evidence because of her unavailability. The appellant also does not adequately document her allegation that the Tax Court initially indicated that she could introduce Dr. Raynor\u2019s letters through her testimony. Finally, I am also not convinced by the appellant\u2019s bald allegation that she could not have introduced the B.C. Minister of Finance document as evidence at trial with the exercise of due diligence.\n[11] Nevertheless, the appellant alleges in her notice of appeal that the Tax Court erred in refusing to accept at least the tax documents and Dr. Raynor\u2019s letters as evidence. In order for this Court to be in a position to determine whether the Tax Court erred in this respect, it will be necessary to have reference to these documents. Therefore, though they will not be accepted as fresh evidence, they should be included in the appeal book.\nIII. Supplemental Appeal Book [12] In view of the respondent\u2019s consent mentioned above, the only issue remaining in dispute in relation to the supplemental appeal book is the responsibility for ordering and paying for the transcripts. The respondent relies on the general rule that the appellant is responsible for arranging for the production of transcripts if necessary for the appeal. The respondent also notes that the appellant provides no support for her statement that she cannot afford to pay for the transcripts.\n[13] I agree with the respondent. The appellant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to convince me that she cannot afford to pay for the transcripts. In any case, I am not convinced that the respondent should be required to bear the cost of the transcripts to support the appellant\u2019s appeal.\n[14] However, it would appear that the appellant does not need transcripts. The website of the Tax Court indicates that audio recordings of hearings before that court are made available on request of a party for the purposes of appeal. Obtaining such recordings would avoid the high cost of transcripts.\n[15] I will order that the transcripts or audio recordings be included in the appeal book, but the appellant will remain responsible for obtaining them.\nIV. Amended Memoranda of Fact and Law [16] As indicated above, the parties agree that the parties should be allowed to submit amended memoranda of fact and law to reflect the content of the supplemental appeal book. That is appropriate. I will make a timetable for the exchange of amended memoranda of fact and law. That table will recognize the appellant\u2019s expressed concern about the limited time she was given for bringing the present motion.\n[17] At paragraph 46 of her written representations in support of the present motion, the appellant suggests that she might want an increase to the usual 30-page limit for memoranda of fact and law. However, she makes no argument in this regard, and I see no need to increase the page limit.\nV. Mr. Tinkham [18] The respondent opposes the reinstatement of Mr. Tinkham to represent the appellant in Court because this Court already refused this request in its Order dated May 12, 2023. In reply, the appellant simply disagrees.\n[19] I agree with the respondent that Mr. Tinkham should not be reinstated. The Court addressed this question in its Order dated May 12, 2023, and decided that Mr. Tinkham should not be allowed to make representations on behalf of the appellant at the hearing of this appeal. I see no reason to revisit that decision.\nVI. Consolidation [20] The respondent notes that a single notice of appeal was filed in respect of a Tax Court decision that addressed two proceedings in that court. The respondent argues therefore that the proceeding before this Court concerns two appeals, which should be consolidated as was done in Canada v. Microbjo Properties Inc., 2023 FCA 157 at para. 2 (Microbjo).\n[21] In my view, the circumstances in this appeal are distinguishable from those in Microbjo. There, a single set of reasons was prepared in respect of five distinct judgments for the five proceedings before that court. Five separate notices of appeal should have been filed to address the five judgments. Here, the Tax Court issued a single judgment in respect of the two Tax Court proceedings, which single judgment is the object of the present appeal. A single notice of appeal was appropriate in this case.\nVII. Conclusion [22] For the foregoing reasons, the appellant\u2019s motion will be granted in part. Neither party seeks an award of costs on this motion, and I will not award any\n\"George R.

C-42, against allegations of infringement of copyright and moral rights. Subsection 64(2) reads as follows:\n64(2) Where copyright subsists in a design applied to a useful article or in an artistic work from which the design is derived and, by or under the authority of any person who owns the copyright in Canada or who owns the copyright elsewhere,\n64(2) Ne constitue pas une violation du droit d\u2019auteur ou des droits moraux sur un dessin appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 un objet utilitaire, ou sur une oeuvre artistique dont le dessin est tir\u00e9, ni le fait de reproduire ce dessin, ou un dessin qui n\u2019en diff\u00e8re pas sensiblement, en r\u00e9alisant l\u2019objet ou toute reproduction graphique ou mat\u00e9rielle de celui-ci, ni le fait d\u2019accomplir avec un objet ainsi r\u00e9alis\u00e9, ou sa reproduction, un acte r\u00e9serv\u00e9 exclusivement au titulaire du droit, pourvu que l\u2019objet, de par l\u2019autorisation du titulaire \u2014 au Canada ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger \u2014 remplisse l\u2019une des conditions suivantes :\n(a) the article is reproduced in a quantity of more than fifty, or\na) \u00eatre reproduit \u00e0 plus de cinquante exemplaires;\n(b) where the article is a plate, engraving or cast, the article is used for producing more than fifty useful articles,\nb) s\u2019agissant d\u2019une planche, d\u2019une gravure ou d\u2019un moule, servir \u00e0 la production de plus de cinquante objets utilitaires.\nit shall not thereafter be an infringement of the copyright or the moral rights for anyone\n[BLANK]\n(c) to reproduce the design of the article or a design not differing substantially from the design of the article by\n[BLANK]\n(i) making the article, or\n[BLANK]\n(ii) making a drawing or other reproduction in any material form of the article, or\n[BLANK]\n(d) to do with an article, drawing or reproduction that is made as described in paragraph (c) anything that the owner of the copyright has the sole right to do with the design or artistic work in which the copyright subsists.\n[BLANK]\n[2] The principles applicable to statutory interpretation are well known, and have been discussed in many court decisions. The Supreme Court of Canada stated as follows in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653 at paras. 117\u201318:\nA court interpreting a statutory provision does so by applying the \u201cmodern principle\u201d of statutory interpretation, that is, that the words of a statute must be read \u201cin their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament\u201d: Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, and Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26, both quoting E. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87. Parliament and the provincial legislatures have also provided guidance by way of statutory rules that explicitly govern the interpretation of statutes and regulations: see, e.g., Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21.\nThis Court has adopted the \u201cmodern principle\u201d as the proper approach to statutory interpretation, because legislative intent can be understood only by reading the language chosen by the legislature in light of the purpose of the provision and the entire relevant context: [Sullivan Ruth, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes, 6th ed (Markham, Ont: LexisNexis, 2014 at 7\u20138).] Those who draft and enact statutes expect that questions about their meaning will be resolved by an analysis that has regard to the text, context and purpose\u2026\n[3] Statutory interpretation is a question of law and is to be reviewed on a standard of correctness in this appeal: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at para. 8 (Housen).\n[4] Based on statements and debates from around the time that subsection 64(2) was introduced into the Copyright Act, the broad purpose of this provision was to limit the scope of copyright and moral rights for designs applied to certain products that are reproduced in industrial quantities. Paragraphs 47 to 50 of the respondent\u2019s memorandum of fact and law cite some of these statements and debates. The general idea was that such designs should instead be protected by registration of an industrial design, which has a much shorter life than copyright.\n[5] However, the wording Parliament chose for subsection 64(2) is more nuanced than the broad purpose and general idea described above. Parliament did not simply provide that a design that is, or could be, the subject of an industrial design could not be enforced through the Copyright Act. In fact, that is essentially the approach the Copyright Act took prior to the introduction of subsection 64(2) in its current form: Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-30, s. 46. The text of subsection 64(2) does not simply state that there can be no copyright or moral rights infringement at all of a design that is contemplated therein. Rather, Parliament chose to exclude certain activities from infringement and carefully crafted wording both for the kinds of designs that are covered by subsection 64(2) and for the activities that are shielded thereby from infringement. The care with which subsection 64(2) was drafted is further demonstrated by the significant structural difference between the English and French versions of the provision. Despite this significant structural difference, I see no difference in substance between the two versions that is relevant to this appeal.\n[6] Subsection 64(2) contemplates \u201ca design applied to a useful article\u201d in which \u201ccopyright subsists\u201d, where that article has been \u201creproduced in a quantity of more than fifty\u201d \u201cby or under the authority of any person who owns the copyright.\u201d There is no dispute that the product in issue in this appeal meets these criteria.\n[7] Subsection 64(2) goes on to provide that it shall not be an infringement of copyright or moral rights for anyone to do the things indicated in paragraphs (c) and (d) thereof. This is where the dispute in this appeal lies.\n[8] This appeal concerns the Poppy Puppy, a plush toy created by the appellant, Leonard B. French, in 1998. Essentially, it represents a Dalmatian dog whose spots appear as poppies. The Poppy Puppy is the object of industrial design and copyright registrations in Canada. The industrial design registration, No. 97954, expired in 2013. Mr. French also obtained a design patent and a copyright registration in the United States in relation to the Poppy Puppy.\n[9] In 2003, Mr. French sold 150,000 units of the Poppy Puppy (in two sizes) to the respondent, the Royal Canadian Legion (Dominion Command) (the Legion). The Legion is an organization that advocates for veterans and their dependents, and sells Poppy and Legion branded items through its Legion Supply Catalogue and its website.\n[10] The Legion made no purchases of the Poppy Puppy from Mr. French after 2003. Many years later, in 2020, Mr. French became aware that the Poppy Puppy was still being advertised in the Legion Supply Catalogue, and with the following statement:\nThese toys have been [or \u201cThis toy has been\u201d] developed by the Legion to act as an aid in teaching children about the Poppy and the Poppy\u2019s role in Remembrance.\n[11] The Federal Court, in its decision under appeal (2023 FC 749, per Justice Michael D. Manson), found that this statement appeared in the Legion Supply Catalogue from 2004 until 2021 (see paragraph 52 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons).\n[12] In 2021, Mr. French commenced an action against the Legion in the Federal Court claiming infringement of copyright and moral rights in the Poppy Puppy. In support of his claim of copyright infringement, Mr. French alleged that the Legion had switched to an alternative supplier for the Poppy Puppy. However, the Federal Court found that there was no evidence to support this allegation. It also found that the copyright infringement claim was barred by a limitation period. Accordingly, Mr. French is not pursuing the copyright infringement claim in this appeal.\n[13] In support of his allegation of infringement of moral rights, Mr. French cited the statement in the Legion Supply Catalogue reproduced in paragraph 10 above, which he argued was a false claim of authorship of the Poppy Puppy. He argued that the statement infringed his right to be associated with his work as its author or to remain anonymous, as contemplated in subsection 14.1(1) of the Copyright Act.\n[14] The Federal Court found it unnecessary to decide the question of moral rights infringement because it found that any acts by the Legion that might otherwise have constituted infringement fell within subsection 64(2) of the Copyright Act, and hence avoided infringement. Despite this finding, the Federal Court was clearly concerned that the statement in question in the Legion Supply Catalogue was problematic. At paragraph 54 of its reasons, it stated:\nThere is a stark difference between remaining silent as to the authorship of a work and, as the Legion did, falsely claiming authorship of a work. There is no valid basis whatsoever for why the Legion claimed to have developed the Poppy Puppy itself, in place of the Plaintiff, whether the Plaintiff wanted to remain anonymous or not.\n[15] The dispute in this appeal concerns whether the Federal Court erred in finding that the Legion\u2019s activities fell within subsection 64(2) to avoid a finding of infringement of moral rights. Mr. French argues that subsection 64(2) is not applicable in the present case because the Legion\u2019s impugned action, making a false claim of authorship in the Legion Supply Catalogue, falls within neither paragraph (c) nor (d) of subsection 64(2). Unfortunately, the Federal Court provided little analysis to support its conclusion that subsection 64(2) applied. Its analysis in this regard focused mainly on whether the exception in subsection 64(3) applied to deny the Legion the benefit of subsection 64(2) (see paragraphs 27 to 35 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons). The Federal Court concluded that subsection 64(3) did not apply, and Mr. French also takes issue with that conclusion.\n[16] I will first address subsection 64(3). This provision reads as follows:\n64(3) Subsection (2) does not apply in respect of the copyright or the moral rights in an artistic work in so far as the work is used as or for\n64(3) Le paragraphe (2) ne s\u2019applique pas au droit d\u2019auteur ou aux droits moraux sur une oeuvre artistique dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle est utilis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des fins suivantes :\n(a) a graphic or photographic representation that is applied to the face of an article;\na) repr\u00e9sentations graphiques ou photographiques appliqu\u00e9es sur un objet;\n(b) a trademark or a representation thereof or a label;\nb) marques de commerce, ou leurs repr\u00e9sentations, ou \u00e9tiquettes;\n(c) material that has a woven or knitted pattern or that is suitable for piece goods or surface coverings or for making wearing apparel;\nc) mat\u00e9riel dont le motif est tiss\u00e9 ou tricot\u00e9 ou utilisable \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce ou comme rev\u00eatement ou v\u00eatement;\n(d) an architectural work that is a building or a model of a building;\nd) oeuvres architecturales qui sont des b\u00e2timents ou des mod\u00e8les ou maquettes de b\u00e2timents;\n(e) a representation of a real or fictitious being, event or place that is applied to an article as a feature of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament;\ne) repr\u00e9sentations d\u2019\u00eatres, de lieux ou de sc\u00e8nes r\u00e9els ou imaginaires pour donner une configuration, un motif ou un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9coratif \u00e0 un objet;\n(f) articles that are sold as a set, unless more than fifty sets are made; or\nf) objets vendus par ensembles, pourvu qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait pas plus de cinquante ensembles;\n(g) such other work or article as may be prescribed by regulation.\ng) autres oeuvres ou objets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s par r\u00e8glement.\n[17] Mr. French argues that the Federal Court should have found that subsection 64(3) applied to deny the Legion the benefit of subsection 64(2). Specifically, Mr. French argues that the Federal Court erred in stating that the design in issue was the Poppy Puppy as a whole rather than merely the pattern of poppies applied to it. Having made this error, Mr. French submits, the Federal Court failed to recognize that the case concerned an artistic work used as a graphic representation that is applied to the face of an article, as contemplated by paragraph 64(3)(a).\n[18] In my view, this argument cannot succeed. As noted by the Legion, Mr. French\u2019s position in this regard is new on appeal; he stated before the Federal Court in several ways that the design in question was the Poppy Puppy as a whole: see paragraphs 34 to 36 of the respondent\u2019s memorandum of fact and law.\n[19] Moreover, all of the copyright and design registrations obtained by Mr. French related to this case describe the Poppy Puppy toy itself rather than the poppies applied thereto. At the hearing of this appeal, Mr. French referred to drawings that are included in his United States design patent, and argued that dotted lines thereon indicate what is not intended to be part of the design, and that the design was limited to the poppies. I have carefully examined the drawings in question and have no doubt that Mr. French\u2019s argument in this regard must be rejected. The only dotted lines I see are to indicate stitching on the plush toy.\n[20] More importantly, the Federal Court\u2019s identification of the Poppy Puppy as a whole as being the object of Mr. French\u2019s copyright is a finding of mixed fact and law without an extricable question of law. Accordingly, this Court will defer to the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion unless we are convinced that it has made an error that is both palpable (obvious) and overriding (going to the very core of the outcome of the case): Housen at para 36; Benhaim v. St-Germain, 2016 SCC 48, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 352 at para. 38. I am not convinced that the Federal Court made such an error in this regard.\n[21] Aside from his argument concerning the application of subsection 64(3), Mr. French also argues that the Federal Court erroneously read subsection 64(2) as if any potential infringement of moral rights was contemplated therein. In fact, Mr. French argues, paragraph 64(2)(c) covers only reproduction of the design of the article in question either by making it or by making a drawing or other reproduction of it, and paragraph 64(2)(d) covers only doing with an article, drawing or reproduction that is made as described in paragraph (c) anything that the owner of the copyright has the sole right to do with the design or artistic work in question. Mr. French argues that paragraph (c) does not apply because of the Federal Court\u2019s findings that (i) the Legion had not found an alternative supplier for the Poppy Puppy (see paragraph 12 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons), and (ii) there was no evidence of copyright infringement (see paragraph 20 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons). Mr. French also argues that paragraph (d) likewise does not apply because that paragraph is limited to articles (as well as drawings and reproductions) that are made as described in paragraph (c), and it is acknowledged that there was no such article as described in paragraph (c).\n[22] The Legion\u2019s memorandum of fact and law does not respond to this point. The Legion does not dispute that the statement in the Legion Supply Catalogue was false, but it maintains that the defence of subsection 64(2) applies. It focuses on the reference in paragraph 64(2)(d) to the breadth of doing \u201cwith an article \u2026 anything that the owner of the copyright has the sole right to do\u201d.\n[23] At the hearing of this appeal, the Legion urged the Court to read paragraph 64(2)(d) such that the \u201cmade as described in paragraph (c)\u201d clause would apply to the \u201creproduction\u201d and\/or the \u201cdrawing\u201d mentioned in paragraph (d), but not to the \u201carticle\u201d. I do not read paragraph 64(2)(d) this way. In my view, it is clear that the reference to \u201can article, drawing or reproduction\u201d in paragraph (d) is intended to correspond to the \u201carticle\u201d mentioned in subparagraph 64(2)(c)(i) and the \u201cdrawing or other reproduction\u201d mentioned in subparagraph 64(2)(c)(ii). Accordingly, the \u201carticle\u201d mentioned in paragraph 64(2)(d) must have been \u201cmade as described in paragraph (c).\u201d\n[24] The Legion relies principally on the argument that subsection 64(2) is intended to be a full defence to a claim of infringement of copyright or moral rights, the reasoning being that one should not be allowed to enforce the same design as both an industrial design and a copyrighted work. In support of this argument, the Legion cites Magasins Greenberg Lt\u00e9e v. Import-Export Ren\u00e9 Derhy (Canada) Inc., [1995] F.C.J. No. 302, 61 C.P.R. (3d) 133 (F.C.T.D.) (Magasins Greenberg), and specifically paragraph 10 thereof. The Legion cites a quote therein from Hugues G. Richard et al., Canadian Copyright Act: Annotated, vol 3 (Toronto: Carswell, 1994) at 64-12, that provides as follows:\nBoth sections 64 and 64.1 set out a series of acts which, when the conditions of the appropriate subsections are met, are deemed not to constitute an infringement of copyright or moral right in certain designs or features applied to useful articles [emphasis in Magasins Greenberg]\n[25] This passage is of limited assistance in advancing the Legion\u2019s argument concerning the meaning of \u201cmade as described in paragraph (c)\u201d, since it explicitly recognizes that \u201cthe conditions of the appropriate subsections\u201d (subsection 64(2) in this case) must be met. It does not indicate what is necessary to meet those conditions.\n[26] The same paragraph 10 from Magasins Greenberg also provides a quote from Roger T. Hughes & Susan J. Peacock, eds, Hughes on Copyright and Industrial Design (Markham: Butterworths, 1994) at 573-31. This quote is notable because it does not explicitly recognize limits on the activities contemplated by subsection 64(2):\n\u2026 [W]here copyright otherwise subsists in a design applied to a \"useful article\" or an artistic work derived from that design and the owner or anyone authorized by the Canadian or a foreign owner of copyright makes fifty or more copies \u2026 then it is not an infringement to make that article or any drawing or other reproduction of the article or otherwise do what the copyright owner could do. [Emphasis added.]\n[27] Nevertheless, the words \u201cmade as described in paragraph (c)\u201d appear in paragraph 64(2)(d), and they must be given some meaning; Parliament does not speak in vain. There is little jurisprudence concerning subsection 64(2), and nothing directly on the point in dispute in this appeal. It is tempting to agree with Mr. French\u2019s argument that the wording of subsection 64(2) indicates an intention to limit the scope of the infringement exclusion to specific activities that are associated with the copyrighted design applied to an article or a drawing or other reproduction thereof. It is also tempting to agree with Mr. French that subsection 64(2) does not apply in this case because there is no evidence that the false statement in the Legion Supply Catalogue was associated with any reproduction of the Poppy Puppy. The appeal book does not include any copy of the Legion Supply Catalogue, so we cannot see how the statement was presented. Despite the Legion\u2019s assertion to the contrary, we cannot be sure that a photograph or other reproduction of the Poppy Puppy appeared in the Legion Supply Catalogue in association with the false statement. If it were otherwise, the Legion might be better placed to argue that the false statement was part of doing \u201cwith an article, drawing or reproduction that is made as described in paragraph (c)\u201d something that Mr. French, as owner of the copyright, had the sole right to do.\n[28] However, despite the allure of Mr. French\u2019s approach, I note that it would lead to a result in which the Legion would benefit from subsection 64(2) if it had reproduced the design, but not if it did not. Such a result would be absurd because it would benefit a party that had infringed both copyright (by reproducing the work) and moral rights (by falsely claiming authorship of the work), but not one who had infringed only moral rights. It is difficult to conceive that this was the intention of Parliament in enacting subsection 64(2).\n[29] Nevertheless, we still have the question as to what limits Parliament intended to place on the defence against infringement provided for in subsection 64(2). If the defence was intended to be available in respect of all acts of infringement, then presumably Parliament would not have chosen such detailed and careful wording. The answer to the limits that Parliament intended to place on the defence provided for in subsection 64(2) does not come from that provision. It comes from another provision of the Copyright Act, subsection 14.1(1), which defines an author\u2019s moral rights as follows:\n14.1 (1) The author of a work has, subject to section 28.2, the right to the integrity of the work and, in connection with an act mentioned in section 3, the right, where reasonable in the circumstances, to be associated with the work as its author by name or under a pseudonym and the right to remain anonymous.\n14.1 (1) L\u2019auteur d\u2019une oeuvre a le droit, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 28.2, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019oeuvre et, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tout acte mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 3, le droit, compte tenu des usages raisonnables, d\u2019en revendiquer, m\u00eame sous pseudonyme, la cr\u00e9ation, ainsi que le droit \u00e0 l\u2019anonymat.\n[30] Section 28.1 of the Copyright Act defines infringement of moral rights:\n28.1 Any act or omission that is contrary to any of the moral rights of the author of a work or of the performer of a performer\u2019s performance is, in the absence of the author\u2019s or performer\u2019s consent, an infringement of those rights.\n28.1 Constitue une violation des droits moraux de l\u2019auteur sur son oeuvre ou de l\u2019artiste-interpr\u00e8te sur sa prestation tout fait \u2014 acte ou omission \u2014 non autoris\u00e9 et contraire \u00e0 ceux-ci.\n[31] Subsection 14.1(1) contemplates two aspects of moral rights: integrity of the work and authorship. Only the authorship aspect is relevant in this appeal. The text relevant to authorship is limited to a right \u201cin connection with an act mentioned in section 3\u201d. Section 3 of the Copyright Act defines the rights associated with copyright, including the sole right to produce, reproduce, perform and publish the work, and to authorize any of the foregoing activities. The reference in subsection 14.1(1) to these rights ties an author\u2019s moral rights to copyright in the work in much the same way that subsection 64(2) is tied to a use of copyright. This suggests that the defence to infringement of moral rights provided for in subsection 64(2), including paragraph 64(2)(d), is intended to cover any infringement of the author\u2019s moral rights. For there to be an infringement of moral rights, it must be in connection with the copyright; if there is no act in connection with copyright, there is no infringement of moral rights. Though it is not binding on this Court, I note that a similar view of the law was expressed in Dolmage v. Erskine, 23 C.P.R. (4th) 495, [2003] O.J. No. 161 at paras. 77\u201380 (Ont. Sup. Ct., Sm. Cl. Div.). This interpretation of subsection 64(2) and the scope of moral rights is also consistent with the broad purpose and general idea of subsection 64(2) as described in paragraph 4 above.\n[32] Given the limited scope of moral rights contemplated in subsection 14.1(1), I cannot see how the false statement by the Legion concerning authorship could fall outside paragraph 64(2)(d) as Mr. French argues (because it was not associated with a reproduction of the design of the Poppy Puppy), and yet still be an infringement of moral rights. Either paragraph 64(2)(d) benefits the Legion as a defence to infringement of moral rights (if the false statement was associated with a reproduction of the Poppy Puppy), or there was no infringement of moral rights in the first place (because the false statement was not associated with a reproduction of the Poppy Puppy). Either way, the Legion is not liable for infringement of Mr. French\u2019s moral rights. It is not necessary to decide whether a reproduction of the Poppy Puppy actually appeared in the Legion Supply Catalogue.\n[33] Though the Federal Court\u2019s analysis of the application of subsection 64(2) in this case was insufficient, it is my view that it made no reviewable error in dismissing Mr. French\u2019s claim of infringement of moral rights.\n[34] For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss this appeal.\n[35] Because the Legion has requested the right to make submissions on costs after the decision on the merits, I would not decide the question of costs at this time. Instead, I would provide a timetable for submissions on costs.\n\"George R.

In its reports, the Commissioner concluded that the Lobbyists\u2019 Code of Conduct (former Code), developed pursuant to subsection 10.2(1) of the Lobbying Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. 44 (4th Supp.), was not breached by two registered lobbyists.\n[2] Specifically, the Commissioner was tasked with determining whether the registered lobbyists had breached Rules 6 and 9 of the former Code\u2013which related to conflicts of interest\u2013by attempting to lobby the then Minister of International Trade after having conducted political activities on her behalf. The appellant alleges that the Federal Court erred by finding that the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation and application of Rules 6 and 9 of the former Code were reasonable.\n[3] It is noteworthy that a new version of the former Code came into force on July 1, 2023, (current Code).\n[4] Namely, the current Code does not contain former Rules 6 and 9. In fact, they no longer exist. Current Rule 4.3 replaces former Rule 6 and current Rule 4.2 replaces former Rule 9 (see Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying of Canada, Renewing the Lobbyists\u2019 Code of Conduct\u2013Updated standards for ethical and transparent lobbying (Ottawa: OCLC, 2022) at 15\u201318).\n[5] Given the coming into force of the current Code, this Court must now determine whether the appellant\u2019s appeal has become moot and, if so, whether it should exercise its discretion to hear it. A matter becomes moot when there is no longer a live controversy affecting the rights of the parties (Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), 57 D.L.R. (4th) 231, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342 at 353 (Borowski)). A court must consider the following criteria when deciding to exercise its discretion to hear a moot matter: (i) whether there exists an adversarial context; (ii) whether deciding the matter would result in a waste of judicial resources; and (iii) whether the Court would exceed its proper role by deciding the issue (Borowski at 358\u201363).\n[6] It is apparent that no live controversy exists in this case. The appellant acknowledged that it is not pursuing this appeal with the objective of finding the registered lobbyists in contravention of the former Code, but rather to seek guidance, \u201cgoing forward\u201d, on the interpretation of specific expressions contained in the former Code (Memorandum of fact and law of the Appellant at para. 8). Although the appellant contends that some expressions contained in the former Code also appear in the current Code, their meaning remains to be informed by the entirety of the new text of the Sections or Rules of the current Code in which they appear. Hence, considering that: (i) the former Code, which contextualized these expressions, no longer exists; (ii) the issues that were before the Commissioner will not arise in the same way under the current Code; and (iii) the current Code was not before the Commissioner nor before the Federal Court, no live issue remains between the parties. This Court has consistently held that a \u201cmere jurisprudential interest fails to satisfy the need for a concrete and tangible controversy\u201d (Canadian Union of Public Employees (Air Canada Component) v. Air Canada, 2021 FCA 67 at para. 7; see also Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 90; Peckford v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 219). We are therefore of the view that this appeal is moot.\n[7] Neither has the appellant convinced us that we should exercise our discretion to hear the appeal. A weighing of the Borowski factors strongly opposes the hearing of the appeal as it would result in a waste of judicial resources and offend the principle of judicial economy. Further, the appellant has not persuaded us that the issues raised are elusive of review. It would be inappropriate for the Court to rule on the interpretation of expressions and rules contained in the former Code. Should these issues arise again; the appellant will have the opportunity to challenge the interpretation of these expressions in the context of the current Code and the Commissioner will provide its interpretation. In sum, the appellant is asking our Court to provide a legal opinion in the abstract, which is not our role, as ruling on these issues in the absence of a live controversy would lead the Court to overstep its adjudicative role.\n[8] Finally, the appellant challenges the Federal Court\u2019s award of costs on the basis that it was acting in the public interest and that it did not seek its own costs. However, the appellant\u2019s public interest standing does not provide immunity from costs and, consequently, did not preclude the Federal Court from rendering a cost award. The appellant has not convinced us that, in the circumstances of this case, the Federal Court erred in its discretionary decision to award costs. Our intervention is not warranted.\n[9] The appeal will therefore be dismissed, with costs payable to the respondent.\n\"Richard Boivin\"\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-181-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nDEMOCRACY WATCH v.

The Federal Court dismissed Janssen\u2019s application for judicial review of a decision of the Minister of Health. The Minister found that Janssen\u2019s nasal spray, SPRAVATO, was not an \u201cinnovative drug\u201d under subsection C.08.004.1(1) of the Food and Drug Regulations, C.R.C., c. 870, and, thus, was not entitled to data protection.\n[2] The appeal must be dismissed. We agree with the Federal Court\u2019s dismissal of the application, substantially for the reasons it gave on the reasonableness of the Minister\u2019s interpretation and application of subsection C.08.004.1(1).\n[3] In particular, we agree with the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, effective in July 2020, does not displace this Court\u2019s previous interpretation of subsection C.08.004.1(1): Takeda Canada Inc. v. Canada (Health), 2013 FCA 13, [2014] 3 F.C.R. 70 and Janssen Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 137. Since the Agreement, the wording of the definition of \u201cinnovative drug\u201d in subsection C.08.004.1(1) has not changed. Thus, our two previous cases bind us: R. v. Sullivan, 2022 SCC 19, 472 D.L.R. (4th) 521; Miller v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 FCA 370, 220 D.L.R. (4th) 149. Accordingly, the interpretation of subsection C.08.004.1(1) adopted by the Minister in this case with substantial reasons offered in support remains reasonable.\n[4] It is trite that while international treaties can form part of the context relevant to the adoption of legislation, they do not amend legislation: Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada. v. Entertainment Software Association, 2022 SCC 30, 471 D.L.R. (4th) 391. For good measure, section 3 of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement Implementation Act, S.C. 2020, c. 1 provides that the Agreement is to be used to interpret legislation, not amend it. And subsection 30(3) of the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-27 empowers the Governor in Council to make regulations bringing the Agreement into effect, but as far as subsection C.08.004.1(1) is concerned, it has not made any change. While subsection C.08.004.1(2) provides that the purpose of section C.08.004.1 is to implement articles 20.48 and 20.49 of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, it continues to provide that the section is to implement article 39 of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, 1869 U.N.T.S. 299, which supports the previous interpretation of subsection C.08.004.1(1).\n[5] If the unchanged, specific wording of subsection C.08.004.1(1), as interpreted by this Court, does not conform with the Agreement, other legal and political recourses may be available. In this regard, we underscore our agreement with paragraph 54 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons. We add that any vires challenge cannot be inserted into this proceeding at this late time, as the notice of appeal purports to do. Rather, it must be brought in a new proceeding with an evidentiary record developed for that purpose.\n[6] As for Janssen\u2019s submission that the Minister unreasonably refused to reassess the data protection eligibility of the nasal spray, SPRAVATO, given our resolution of the interpretation issue, this issue is moot. Any reassessment would not have resulted in relief.\n[7] Therefore, we will dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at the agreed upon amount of $4,000.\n\u201cDavid Stratas\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-21-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nJANSSEN INC. v.

P-4 [the Act].\n[2] The appellants claim that the respondents \u201cused\u201d their invention and infringed their patent when, in order to enter into commercially valuable transactions, they disclosed to prospective business partners and stakeholders, as a proof of concept, drawings, specifications and cost estimates of a design which, if ever built, would comprise the essential elements of the patent.\n[3] The novel and expansive reading of \u201cuse\u201d proposed by the appellants to support their claim of infringement finds no basis in the language of the Act or the leading precedents that have interpreted it. Its adoption by this Court would undermine the accepted principles underlying Canada\u2019s regime of patent protection, including the patent bargain, and inject uncertainty into a well-settled area of law. For the reasons that follow, I would reject the appellants\u2019 proposed interpretation of section 42 and dismiss the appeal.\nI. Background [4] This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Court (per Justice Manson) on a motion for summary trial dismissing the appellants\u2019 action against the respondents for patent infringement: Steelhead LNG (ASLNG) Ltd. v. ARC Resources Ltd., 2022 FC 998, [2022] F.C.J. No. 1012 [FC Decision].\n[5] The motion judge outlined the relevant background in this case: FC Decision at paras. 2\u201316. I will nonetheless summarize the facts necessary to dispose of this appeal.\nA. Context [6] The appellants are Steelhead LNG Limited Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiary Steelhead LNG (ASLNG) Ltd. (collectively, Steelhead). Steelhead is pursuing the development of liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in British Columbia. The subsidiary owns the patent at issue, Canadian Patent No. 3,027,085 (the 085 Patent) and licences it to its parent company.\n[7] The 085 Patent relates to apparatus, methods, and systems in respect to the near-shore or at-shore liquefaction of natural gas. The invention it claims\u2014a near-shore or at-shore floating LNG (FLNG) facility\u2014comprises three key elements: 1) a floating modular design, 2) an air-cooled liquefaction process, and 3) electric-driven compressors.\n[8] The 085 Patent was filed on December 10, 2018, became open to public inspection on February 8, 2019, and was issued on November 3, 2020. The patent is in full force and, subject to the payment of periodic maintenance fees, expires on December 10, 2038.\n[9] There are four respondents. The first respondent is Rockies LNG Limited Partnership, a consortium of British Columbia and Alberta natural gas producers pursuing LNG export opportunities. The second respondent is Rockies LNG GP Corp., the general partner of the first respondent. The third and fourth respondents, ARC Resources Ltd. and Birchcliff Energy Ltd., are in the business of resource extraction, including natural gas. They are also two of the seven limited partners of the first respondent. All seven limited partners share one or more common directors with the first respondent.\n[10] The relevant facts and the timeline of this case are not contested. Steelhead and 7G, the predecessor to ARC Resources, had a business relationship from 2014 to November 2018. They were in talks to further the appellants\u2019 development of their LNG facilities in British Columbia. In September 2018, the appellants disclosed confidential information to a group of natural gas producers (the Consortium) that included 7G and Birchcliff Energy and that would later be formalized as Rockies LNG Limited Partnership. This confidential information included the design for a proposed LNG facility. Two months later, the Consortium unilaterally ended discussions with the appellants.\n[11] In the meantime, the Consortium hired a third party to prepare a preliminary Front End Engineering Design (\u201cpre-FEED\u201d) study for an LNG facility. The pre-FEED study contained engineering drawings, specifications and cost estimates. It was considered to be in the conceptual stage of the FLNG facility project, with many options in the design left to be decided.\n[12] From approximately February 2019 to May 2020, the Consortium showed a high-level summary of the pre-FEED study to potential investors, LNG off-takers (companies that use or re-sell LNG) and large-scale industry contractors, and allowed four of these third parties to see the pre-FEED study itself. None of the third parties participated further with the respondents in respect to its pre-FEED study or the FLNG facility design it contained.\n[13] In April 2019, the Consortium began discussions with Western LNG, a Houston, Texas\u2013based company engaged in the development of LNG export facilities, regarding the design and development of a potential LNG facility. The Consortium did not share the pre-FEED study with Western LNG, which provided and relied on its own LNG facility design.\n[14] In July 2021, Western LNG, the Consortium (now formalized as the respondent Rockies LNG Limited Partnership) and the Nisga\u2019a First Nation entered into an agreement to develop the Ksi Lisims project, a different LNG project that is not the subject of this appeal.\nB. The Patent Infringement Action and the Motion for Summary Trial [15] The appellants commenced the underlying patent infringement action against the defendants (the respondents here) on December 9, 2020. The appellants claim the respondents infringed the 085 Patent through the design, development, and marketing to potential investors, LNG off-takers, First Nations, and large-scale industry contractors, among others, of an LNG project that included a design for an LNG facility that, if built, would comprise the essential elements of the invention claimed in the 085 Patent [the allegedly infringing activities]. The appellants seek monetary, declaratory and injunctive relief for the alleged infringement.\n[16] In their Amended Statement of Claim, the appellants did not advance a quia timet cause of action, which patent-holders can bring to prevent a party from engaging, on an imminent basis, in activity that would raise a strong possibility of infringement: see e.g. AstraZeneca Canada Inc. v. Novopharm Limited, 2010 FCA 112, 405 N.R. 95 at paras. 6\u20137 and the cases cited therein. As such, the appellants\u2019 action alleges no forward-looking infringement or threat of infringement.\n[17] The respondents brought a motion for summary trial pursuant to Rule 213 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106. The appellants argued before the Federal Court and before this Court that summary trial was not appropriate.\n[18] The appellants acknowledged that the respondents did not make, construct, or sell the invention claimed in the 085 Patent, and that the claimed system, method, or apparatus does not exist anywhere in Canada. They also acknowledged that the only question of fact and law is whether the respondents have \u201cused\u201d the invention claimed in the 085 Patent.\n[19] For the purposes of the motion for summary trial only, the respondents conceded that the motion judge could presume that the 085 Patent was valid and that, had the FLNG facility described in the pre-FEED study been built, it would have included all the essential elements of the 085 Patent.\nII. The Federal Court\u2019s Decision [20] The motion judge considered two issues: whether the respondents had established that the matter was appropriate to be decided by way of summary trial; and, if summary trial was appropriate, whether the allegedly infringing activities constituted \u201cuse\u201d of the 085 Patent.\n[21] On the first issue, the motion judge agreed with the respondents that a summary trial was appropriate to decide the matter and that the Court could grant summary judgment, fairly and justly, on the evidence adduced and the law. In particular, he found that 1) the parties had exercised their rights to documentary and oral discovery, 2) any issues concerning witness testimony had been addressed through viva voce testimony at the hearing, and 3) the appellants had not indicated what information they perceived to be missing or how it could influence the Court\u2019s decision of the matter before it.\n[22] On the substantive issue, the motion judge found the allegedly infringing activities did not constitute \u201cuse\u201d of the 085 Patent. As such, the respondents had not infringed the 085 Patent.\n[23] The motion judge held that, to establish that the respondents had infringed the 085 Patent, the appellants had to prove that the respondents used each of the essential elements of one or more of the patent claims through making, constructing, using and\/or selling the invention as claimed in the patent claims.\n[24] The motion judge began by ascertaining the essential elements of the 085 Patent. He determined that, in each of the patent\u2019s four independent claims, there was a series of essential elements that comprise a claimed system for liquefying natural gas. These included a water-based apparatus that comprised a floating hull, an air-cooled electrically driven refrigeration (AER) system to convert the feed gas to LNG, and LNG storage tanks: FC Decision at para. 75. Significantly, the motion judge held that the 085 Patent did not claim \u201cthe conceptual design of the LNG facility invention\u201d: FC Decision at para. 79.\n[25] The motion judge decided that, given that the claimed system did not exist in Canada and that the respondents\u2019 new Ksi Lisims project did not infringe the 085 Patent, the respondents could not have made, constructed or sold the claimed system: FC Decision at para. 76. The only question was whether the respondents\u2019 marketing or promotional efforts, notably sharing with potential stakeholders, investors and industry participants a pre-FEED study for an FLNG facility which, if built, would comprise essential elements of the 085 Patent to demonstrate that they \u201cwere aware of and were addressing challenges and \u2026 advancing potential options for an FLNG facility,\u201d constituted use under section 42 of the Act and infringed the Patent: FC Decision at paras. 77, 82.\n[26] The motion judge rejected the appellants\u2019 argument that the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s purposive interpretation of what constitutes \u201cuse\u201d in Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser, 2004 SCC 34, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 902, supported a finding that, in engaging in the allegedly infringing activities, the respondents had used its invention by exploiting the invention\u2019s purpose or advantage for commercial benefit and thus infringed the 085 Patent.\n[27] The motion judge observed that several passages in Monsanto indicated that infringement under section 42 of the Act required use of the patented invention\u2014an actual, physical apparatus, system or method using such an apparatus\u2014rather than a conceptual design or drawing of an invention. He concluded that, since no FLNG facility such as that claimed in the 085 Patent existed in Canada, it could not have been used by the respondents: FC Decision at paras. 78\u201380.\n[28] The motion judge found that the respondents\u2019 promotional efforts did not constitute infringement in Canada and that the respondents, whose business is to supply natural gas to an FLNG facility, \u201cdid not use a FLNG facility at all, and certainly not one within the claims of the 085 Patent\u201d: FC Decision at para. 84.\n[29] While the motion judge\u2019s conclusion that the respondents had not used the appellants\u2019 invention was sufficient to dismiss the infringement action, the motion judge also determined that the appellants had failed to provide evidence that the defendants obtained a commercial benefit by sharing the pre-FEED study. The third parties who were shown the study had not engaged in a further business relationship with the respondents; the respondents developed their relationship with Indigenous stakeholders through a member of their team and did not include the pre-FEED study as part of discussions with First Nations; and Western LNG approached and entered into a relationship with the respondents with its own LNG facility design.\n[30] In light of his findings on the question of \u201cuse\u201d, the motion judge dismissed the appellants\u2019 action in its entirety.\nIII. Issues before this Court [31] The appellants have appealed the decision of the Federal Court on two grounds. First, they claim the motion judge erred in law by requiring that the patented invention be built as a pre-condition to infringement by \u201cusing\u201d under section 42 of the Act. Instead, the motion judge should have asked whether the respondents had obtained a benefit from exploiting or relying on the claimed elements or advantages of the appellants\u2019 invention. Second, they argue that because the motion judge adopted the incorrect legal test for infringing use, he failed to appreciate that he required additional evidence, including evidence about the purpose and benefit of the appellants\u2019 invention, to decide whether the respondents had infringed the 085 Patent. Accordingly, given the deficient evidentiary record, the motion judge erred in finding that the matter before him was appropriate for summary trial.\n[32] As the appellants conceded at the hearing of this appeal, their success on the second ground of appeal is contingent on their success on the first ground. If this Court does not accept the appellants\u2019 proposed interpretation of \u201cuse\u201d and upholds the motion judge\u2019s decision in this respect, it follows that the matter was appropriate for summary trial.\n[33] The appellants also brought a motion seeking leave to file new evidence on the appeal. This new evidence, they submit, would establish that the respondents derived a commercial benefit from their \u201cuse\u201d of the appellants\u2019 invention. In their view, this evidence is \u201ccentral\u201d to their second ground of appeal because it would establish that the record before the motion judge was unsuitable for a summary adjudication of the matter of infringement.\n[34] For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the motion judge did not err in rejecting the appellants\u2019 novel and expansive interpretation of \u201cuse\u201d under section 42 of the Act and finding that the respondents did not use the invention claimed by the 085 Patent. It follows that the appellants have not presented this Court with any reason to disturb the motion judge\u2019s decision that the matter of infringement was appropriate for summary trial. The motion to file new evidence should also be dismissed, since the appellants seek to bring that evidence before this Court solely to establish \u201cuse\u201d based on their erroneous interpretation of section 42 of the Act.\nIV. Analysis A. Overview [35] Section 42 of the Act defines the exclusive rights granted to the patent holder:\nGrant of Patents\nOctroi des brevets\nContents of patent\nContenu du brevet\n42 Every patent granted under this Act shall contain the title or name of the invention, with a reference to the specification, and shall, subject to this Act, grant to the patentee and the patentee\u2019s legal representatives for the term of the patent, from the granting of the patent, the exclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing and using the invention and selling it to others to be used, subject to adjudication in respect thereof before any court of competent jurisdiction.\n42 Tout brevet accord\u00e9 en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi contient le titre ou le nom de l\u2019invention avec renvoi au m\u00e9moire descriptif et accorde, sous r\u00e9serve des autres dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi, au brevet\u00e9 et \u00e0 ses repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux, pour la dur\u00e9e du brevet \u00e0 compter de la date o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9, le droit, la facult\u00e9 et le privil\u00e8ge exclusif de fabriquer, construire, exploiter et vendre \u00e0 d\u2019autres, pour qu\u2019ils l\u2019exploitent, l\u2019objet de l\u2019invention, sauf jugement en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce par un tribunal comp\u00e9tent.\n[36] The appellants claim that the respondents included in their pre-FEED study a validated set of engineering drawings, specifications, and cost estimates for an FLNG facility design, which, if ever built, would comprise the essential elements of the claims in the 085 Patent. They argue that, by sharing the pre-FEED study with third parties as part of their efforts to promote their FLNG project, the respondents \u201cused\u201d the appellants\u2019 invention by obtaining a commercial advantage or benefit that belonged to the appellants by virtue of the monopoly granted by the Patent. In their submission, the pre-FEED study allowed the respondents to approach vital stakeholders and potential commercial counterparts in a credible fashion and, using the study as a proof of concept, demonstrate that their project was economically and technically feasible. In particular, the appellants claim that, even though the respondents abandoned the pre-FEED study and started a new development (the Ksi Lisims project) with a new design, the respondents were able to conclude a commercially valuable |||||||||||||| |||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| and advance their FLNG project to such a state that it became attractive to Western LNG, resulting in a commercially valuable transaction with that company. In argument, the appellants observed that the respondents used the pre-FEED study to effectively \u201cscoop\u201d them by securing one of the few viable sites for an FLNG development on British Columbia\u2019s coast.\n[37] The appellants claim that, in requiring that an invention be built in order to establish infringement through use, the motion judge erred in three ways. First, he failed to interpret section 42 of the Patent Act in a manner consistent with the purposive approach adopted by the Supreme Court in Monsanto and sufficiently attentive to the statutory context. Second, he erred in distinguishing the decision of the Federal Court in Eurocopter v. Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limit\u00e9e, 2012 FC 113, [2012] 404 F.T.R. 193, aff\u2019d 2013 FCA 219, which, the appellants claim, recognized that infringement may result where a person relies on a patentee\u2019s valuable and marketable technology to credibly promote and solicit pre-orders for their own product. Third, his interpretation deprived the appellants of the time-limited monopoly to build market share for the FLNG facility claimed by the 085 Patent to which they were entitled, under the patent bargain, in return for publishing the 085 Patent and disclosing their useful invention.\n[38] In my opinion, the appellants\u2019 claim that the respondents\u2019 promotional activities of sharing the pre-FEED study with stakeholders, potential investors and commercial partners fall within the patentees\u2019 \u201cexclusive right, privilege and liberty of \u2026 using the invention\u201d under section 42 of the Act must fail. I address each of the three errors alleged by the appellants below.\nB. The motion judge did not err in interpreting section 42 of the Act [39] The appellants argue that, by interpreting section 42 of the Patent Act as requiring that an invention be built in order to establish infringement through use, the motion judge erred for three reasons: 1) he failed to apply the Supreme Court\u2019s purposive interpretation of \u201cuse\u201d set out in Monsanto; 2) he paid insufficient attention to the statutory context; and 3) he failed to consider the benefit allegedly derived by the respondents from the appellants\u2019 invention, a factor identified in Monsanto as indicating infringing use.\n[40] In my view, the appellants\u2019 proposed interpretation of section 42 must be rejected because it is inconsistent with a proper analysis of the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cuse\u201d in Monsanto, of how the terms \u201cobjet\u201d and \u201cobjet de l\u2019invention\u201d are used in the Act and of the role of commercial benefit in determining whether an invention has been used.\n(1) The meaning of \u201cusing the invention\u201d (\u201cexploiter l\u2019objet de l\u2019invention\u201d) according to Monsanto [41] The appellants claim that the motion judge applied a \u201cliteral English meaning of \u2018using\u2019 to require a physical object,\u201d rather than considering the Supreme Court\u2019s view, in Monsanto, that the words \u201cusing\u201d and \u201cexploiter\u201d, when taken together, \u201cconnote utilization with a view to production or advantage.\u201d According to the appellants, the motion judge \u201cmistakenly conflated the word \u2018object\u2019 with a physical object\u201d [emphasis in original] when the Supreme Court in Monsanto uses the word \u201cto mean \u2018goal\u2019 or \u2018purpose\u2019, a decidedly non-physical concept.\u201d While the word \u201cobject\u201d does not appear in the English version of section 42, the word \u201cobjet\u201d appears in the French version and both \u201cobject\u201d and \u201cobjet de l\u2019invention\u201d are used by the Supreme Court in Monsanto to connote \u201cthe purpose and subject matter of the invention.\u201d\n[42] In sum, the appellants argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of the meaning of \u201cuse\u201d in Monsanto stands for the proposition that section 42 of the Patent Act grants a patentee the exclusive right, privilege and liberty of using the goal, purpose or advantage of an invention for commercial benefit. In my view, Monsanto says no such thing.\n[43] To properly understand the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Monsanto, this Court must place it in its proper factual context. Mr. Schmeiser, a farmer, collected, saved and planted canola seed containing genes and cells patented by Monsanto, which made the canola plants resistant to Roundup, a commercial herbicide, thereby facilitating weed spraying. The question before the Supreme Court was whether the farmer\u2019s activities constituted use within the meaning of section 42 of the Act. The Court found that, on a common sense view, saving and planting seed, then harvesting and selling the resultant plants containing the patented genes and cells appeared to constitute \u201cutilization\u201d of the patented material for production and advantage, within the meaning of section 42: Monsanto at para. 69. Significantly, Monsanto unquestionably involved the use of a physical object, since the patented genes and cells were present in the canola plants. Accordingly, the Supreme Court was not called upon to decide whether the terms \u201cinvention\u201d or \u201cobjet de l\u2019invention,\u201d in the French-language version of the Act, include the invention\u2019s goal or purpose. Rather, it elaborated on the meaning of \u201cuse\u201d under section 42 to address Mr. Schmeiser\u2019s two arguments that his activities did not constitute infringement by use.\n[44] First, Mr. Schmeiser had claimed that, since the patent was for genes and cells, infringement by use could occur only where a defendant used these in their isolated, laboratory form: cultivating plants containing the genes and cells could not result in infringement by use. The Supreme Court rejected this argument based on \u201ccentury-old patent law\u201d that holds that \u201cwhere a defendant\u2019s commercial or business activity involves a thing of which a patented part is a significant or important component, infringement is established\u201d: Monsanto at para. 78.\n[45] Second, Mr. Schmeiser had claimed that he had not used the patented invention because, since he had never used Roundup herbicide as an aid to cultivation, he had never taken commercial advantage of the special utility the invention offered: resistance to Roundup. The Supreme Court held that this argument did not rebut the presumption of use that flows from possession because it failed to account for the \u201cstand-by or insurance utility\u201d of the properties of the patented genes and cells. Mr. Schmeiser benefited from that advantage from the outset, since if there were a reason to spray in the future, he could do so: Monsanto at para. 84. Moreover, Mr. Schmeiser had actively cultivated the Roundup-ready canola as part of his business operations and could therefore not rebut the presumption of use flowing from possession by claiming that he had never intended to cultivate plants containing the patented genes and cells, and that their presence on his land was accidental and unwelcome.\n[46] In order to address Mr. Schmeiser\u2019s two arguments, the Supreme Court examined the plain meaning of \u201cuse\u201d and engaged in a purposive and contextual inquiry, looking at its meaning in light of the reasons for according patent protection and of the other words present in section 42.\n[47] It held that \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cexploiter\u201d, in their plain meaning, denote utilization with a view to production or advantage: Monsanto at paras. 31, 58. Then, it observed, at paragraph 35, that the purpose of section 42 is to define the exclusive rights granted to the patent holder\u2014the rights to full enjoyment of the monopoly granted by the patent: \u201cApplied to \u2018use\u2019, the question becomes: did the defendant\u2019s activity deprive the inventor in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, of full enjoyment of the monopoly conferred by law?\u201d [Emphasis in original.] Finally, it found that a contextual examination of section 42 revealed that a patentee\u2019s monopoly generally protects its business interests and that \u201ca defendant\u2019s commercial activities involving the patented object [l\u2019objet brevet\u00e9] will be particularly likely to constitute an infringing use\u201d because \u201cif there is a commercial benefit to be derived from the invention, a contextual analysis of s. 42 indicates that it belongs to the patent holder\u201d: Monsanto at para. 38.\n[48] This discussion of the meaning of \u201cuse\u201d does not support the appellants\u2019 novel and expansive construction of section 42. While the Supreme Court confirms in Monsanto that section 42 defines the rights to full enjoyment of the monopoly granted by the patent, it explains in Free World Trust v. \u00c9lectro Sant\u00e9 Inc., 2000 SCC 66, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1024 at para. 33, that the scope of this monopoly is defined by the patent claims:\nThe Patent Act requires the letters patent granting a patent monopoly to include a specification which sets out a correct and full \u201cdisclosure\u201d of the invention, i.e., \u201ccorrectly and fully describe[s] the invention and its operation or use as contemplated by the inventor\u201d. The disclosure is followed by \u201ca claim or claims stating distinctly and in explicit terms the things or combinations that the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property or privilege\u201d. It is the invention thus claimed to which the patentee receives the \u201cexclusive right, privilege and liberty\u201d of exploitation.\n[Citations omitted; emphasis added.]\n[49] That the right to \u201cuse\u201d attaches to the invention described in the patent claims is confirmed by the terms used by the Supreme Court to describe what is \u201cused\u201d under section 42: \u201cuses the invention\u201d (\u201cexploite l\u2019invention\u201d), \u201cactivities involving the patented object\u201d (\u201cactivit\u00e9s \u2026 qui mettent en cause l\u2019objet brevet\u00e9\u201d) and \u201cused the patented invention\u201d (\u201cexploit\u00e9 l\u2019invention brevet\u00e9e\u201d): Monsanto at paras. 37\u201338, 45. Contrary to the appellants\u2019 claims, these terms do not connote the goal, purpose or advantage of the invention.\n[50] Accordingly, the Supreme Court\u2019s purposive inquiry in Monsanto indicates that what is \u201cused\u201d under section 42 is the claimed invention. In the case of a patent for an apparatus, the claimed invention is the apparatus described in the claims, not its goal, purpose or advantage, however these might be defined.\n[51] The case law examined by the Supreme Court to guide its interpretation of \u201cuse\u201d does not assist the appellants either. These cases fall broadly into two categories, each relevant to one of the defences to infringement put forward by Mr. Schmeiser. Neither of these defences argued in favour of an interpretation of \u201cinvention\u201d or \u201cobjet de l\u2019invention\u201d that included the goal, purpose or advantage of the invention.\n[52] The first category of cases related to whether patent protection extends to situations where the patented invention is contained within something else used by the defendant and addressed Mr. Schmeiser\u2019s claim that growing plants did not amount to \u201cusing\u201d their patented genes and cells. The Court noted that the rule, established in case law, that infringement through use was possible \u201ceven where the patented invention [l\u2019invention brevet\u00e9e] is part of, or composes, a broader unpatented structure or process,\u201d was rooted in the principle that the main purpose of patent protection is to prevent others from depriving the inventor of the full enjoyment of the monopoly to which he is entitled \u201cby virtue of the patent and as a matter of law\u201d: Monsanto at para. 43.\n[53] While the Supreme Court relied, at paragraph 44 of Monsanto, on Saccharin Corp. v. Anglo-Continental Chemical Works, Ld. (1900), 17 R.P.C. 307 (H.C.J.), to confirm that whether a defendant, by his acts or conduct, had deprived the inventor, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, of the advantage of the patented invention was central to a finding of infringement, this decision did not involve \u201cuse\u201d of an invention\u2019s goal, purpose or advantage. The High Court of Justice held that by procuring saccharin manufactured abroad through the use of a patented process for sale in England, the defendant had indirectly used that invention, depriving the patentee of the advantage of the invention. The defendant indirectly employed the claimed invention\u2014the patented process\u2014not its goal, purpose or advantage.\n[54] The appellants argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of Betts v. Neilson (1868), L.R. 3 Ch. App. 429, aff\u2019d (1871), L.R. 5 H.L. 1, offers a \u201cstriking example\u201d of its use of the words \u201cobject\u201d and \u201cobjet\u201d to refer to the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the invention. Their claim does not withstand scrutiny. Mr. Betts owned a patent for making metallic capsules of lead and tin compressed together, which were used to cover the corks of bottles. He claimed that the defendants, who had purchased bottled beer from Scottish brewers for export abroad through English ports, had infringed his patent, since the beer bottles bore metallic capsules falling within the patent claims. In arguing that there had been no infringement, the defendants distinguished between the \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cpassive\u201d use of the invention. They argued that the capsules were placed on the bottles in Scotland, where the bottled beer was sold, and that while the bottles transited through England for purposes of exportation, there was no \u201cactive use of the capsules\u201d which could constitute an infringement. Lord Chelmsford rejected this distinction between the active and passive use of a thing. He defined \u201cactive use\u201d as follows:\nIt is the employment of the machine or the article for the purpose for which it was designed which constitutes its active use; and whether the capsules were intended for ornament, or for protection of the contents of the bottles upon which they were placed, the whole time they were in England they may be correctly said to be in active use for the very objects for which they were placed upon the bottles by the vendors.\n[Betts at p. 439.]\nHe found that there was an active use of the capsules \u201cby those who first placed them upon the bottles, and by those who had them in their possession afterwards with the power of either continuing or removing them\u201d: Betts at p. 440.\n[55] Contrary to the appellants\u2019 claim, the Supreme Court does not, in its treatment of Betts, equate \u201cobject of the patent\u201d (\u201cobjet du brevet\u201d) with \u201cpurpose of the invention\u201d when, at paragraph 45 of Monsanto, it states that \u201c[i]n determining whether the defendant \u2018used\u2019 the patented invention, one compares the object of the patent with what the defendant did and asks whether the defendant\u2019s actions involved that object.\u201d This is made abundantly clear in paragraph 46, where the Court uses \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201cobject\u201d in the same sentence: \u201cthe patented invention need not be deployed precisely for its intended purpose in order for its object to be involved in the defendant\u2019s activity\u201d. The Court intends these different words to convey different meanings: \u201cpurpose\u201d designates the purpose of the invention and \u201cobject\u201d designates the invention claimed in the patent (\u201cl\u2019objet de l\u2019invention\u201d).\n[56] This distinction between \u201cobject\u201d or \u201cobjet de l\u2019invention\u201d and the invention\u2019s purpose is supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s reliance in Monsanto, at paragraph 46, on Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. British and Colonial Motor Car Co. (1901), 18 R.P.C. 313 (H.C.J.). The defendants displayed at a tradeshow a car with patented tires which they had intended to remove prior to sale, substituting other tires. The tires were placed on the car for the purpose of display, and arguably not for their intended purpose (including carrying the load resulting from the car\u2019s weight, guiding the car along a chosen trajectory and transmitting a braking or acceleration force). As Lord Alverstone observed, for the duration of the tradeshow, the cars were supported by the fully inflated tires and \u201cpresented to the possible customer or spectator who came to the Show the appearance of a motor car as it would appear with pneumatic tyres upon it, the weight being taken off by the pressure of the air acting upon the rubber\u201d: Dunlop at p. 315. In his view, this qualified as use:\n\u2026 if a person uses an invention to present his goods for sale, and intending the thing exhibited to represent what he is going to sell, and if part of that thing is an article which is an infringement and is serving a useful purpose during that time by being exhibited as part of the machine, I think it is user of the invention.\n[Dunlop at p. 315; emphasis added.]\n[57] As noted by the Supreme Court, the defendants in Dunlop \u201cemployed the invention to their advantage, depriving the inventor of the full enjoyment of the monopoly\u201d [emphasis added]: Monsanto at para. 46. They did not employ the invention\u2019s goal, purpose or advantage. Like Betts, Dunlop involves the utilization of the invention claimed in the patent. In both cases, these were physical apparatuses\u2014a cork capsule and a pneumatic tire\u2014not a goal, purpose or advantage.\n[58] The second category of cases reviewed by the Court in Monsanto related to Mr. Schmeiser\u2019s defence that, while he had been in possession of seed and plants containing the patented cells and genes, he had not used them or sought to use them for their intended purpose. These cases stood for the proposition that, while a defendant\u2019s intention is generally irrelevant to a finding of infringement, in cases where \u201cuse\u201d could be argued to consist of the defendant\u2019s exploitation of an invention\u2019s stand-by utility, courts would consider as relevant the defendant\u2019s intention to exploit the invention, should the need arise. All of the cases cited by the Supreme Court in this second category, like those in the first category, allege use of the invention claimed by the patent\u2014whether apparatus or process\u2014\u2013not the invention\u2019s goal, purpose or advantage. They do not assist the appellants.\n(2) Contextual interpretation of section 42 of the Act [59] Section 42 defines the monopoly conferred to the patentee and the patentee\u2019s legal representatives as \u201cthe exclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing and using the invention and selling it to others to be used\u201d (\u201cle droit, la facult\u00e9 et le privil\u00e8ge exclusif de fabriquer, construire, exploiter et vendre \u00e0 d\u2019autres, pour qu\u2019ils l\u2019exploitent, l\u2019objet de l\u2019invention\u201d) [emphasis added]. In the French version, \u201cobjet de l\u2019invention\u201d stands for \u201cinvention\u201d.\n[60] The appellants argue that a contextual interpretation of section 42 supports their claim that the word \u201cobjet\u201d in the term \u201cobjet de l\u2019invention\u201d in section 42 is intended to convey the meaning of \u201cgoal\u201d, \u201cpurpose\u201d or \u201cadvantage\u201d of the invention. They point out that the Act uses words other than \u201cobjet de l\u2019invention\u201d to denote a physical good (\u201carticle\u201d in subsections 56(3), (6), (8) and 60(2)) or where physical existence is contemplated (\u201cuse \u2026 the patented invention\u201d (invention brevet\u00e9e) in subsection 55.2(1)). In my view, the appellants\u2019 proposed interpretation is not consistent with how the terms \u201cobjet de l\u2019invention\u201d and \u201cobjet\u201d are used in other provisions of the Act.\n(a) \u201cObjet de l\u2019invention\u201d\n[61] In section 27 of the Act, which addresses the requirements for the issuance of a patent, subsection 4 states that \u201c[t]he specification must end with a claim or claims defining distinctly and in explicit terms the subject-matter of the invention for which an exclusive privilege or property is claimed.\u201d In the French version, the term \u201cobjet de l\u2019invention\u201d stands for \u201csubject-matter of the invention\u201d. According to subsection 27(4), the \u201csubject-matter of the invention,\u201d over which the patent monopoly is conferred, is defined distinctly and in explicit terms in the claims of the patent. It refers to the claimed invention, not its goal, purpose or advantage. The same language is used in subsection 27(5) of the Act.\n[62] Similarly, section 32 of the Act provides that a person who obtains a patent for an improvement on a patented invention does not thereby obtain the right of making, vending or using the original invention. In the French version of the Act, \u201cobjet de l\u2019invention\u201d stands for \u201coriginal invention\u201d, not for the goal, purpose or advantage of the invention.\n(b) \u201cObjet\u201d [63] Section 28.2 of the Act provides that the \u201csubject-matter defined by a claim\u201d in a pending application for a patent must not have previously been disclosed. In the French version of section 28.2, \u201cobjet que d\u00e9finit la revendication\u201d stands for \u201csubject-matter defined by a claim\u201d [emphasis added]. Similarly, section 28.3 of the Act prescribes that the \u201csubject-matter defined by a claim\u201d in an application for a patent in Canada must be subject-matter that would not have been obvious on the claim date to a person skilled in the art or science to which it pertains. In the French version of section 28.3, \u201cobjet que d\u00e9finit la revendication\u201d stands for \u201csubject-matter defined by a claim\u201d [emphasis added].\n(c) Conclusion on the contextual analysis [64] A contextual analysis of the meaning of \u201cobjet\u201d and \u201cobjet de l\u2019invention\u201d demonstrates that these terms are not used in section 42 of the Act to connote the goal, purpose, or advantage of an invention. Rather, they designate the \u201csubject-matter of the invention\u201d or the \u201cinvention\u201d itself as defined in the patent claims, a meaning fully consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s view that \u201c[i]t is the invention thus claimed to which the patentee receives the \u2018exclusive right, privilege and liberty\u2019 of exploitation\u201d: Free World Trust at para. 33.\n(3) The relevance of commercial benefit to infringement by \u201cuse\u201d [65] According to the appellants, when section 42 of the Act is interpreted purposively, as required by the Supreme Court in Monsanto, a court seeking to determine whether an alleged infringer has used a patented invention under section 42 must ask whether the purpose or advantage of the invention were commercially exploited. To ascertain the purpose of the invention, the court must look at the patent disclosure, which sets out the advantages of the invention disclosed. In the case at bar, these advantages include the claimed system\u2019s cost-effectiveness and low environmental impact. The respondents used the pre-FEED study to promote their FLNG plant specifically because of these advantages, thus commercially exploiting the purpose or advantages of the appellants\u2019 invention and infringing the Patent.\n[66] The appellants argue that in deciding, at paragraph 62, that testimony related to the purported advantages of the 085 Patent\u2019s design was \u201cirrelevant\u201d, the motion judge erred by effectively holding, contrary to Monsanto, that whether the respondents had derived a commercial benefit from their activities was not relevant to proof of infringement. It is true that the Supreme Court stated in Monsanto that \u201cusing\u201d under section 42 denotes \u201cutilization with a view to production or advantage\u201d and that \u201cif there is a commercial benefit to be derived from the invention, a contextual analysis of s. 42 indicates that it belongs to the patent holder\u201d: Monsanto at paras. 31, 38. However, the appellants ignore the sentences that precede the latter passage and provide key context to understanding its meaning:\nEven in the absence of commercial exploitation, the patent holder is entitled to protection. However, a defendant\u2019s commercial activities involving the patented object will be particularly likely to constitute infringing use.\n[Monsanto at para. 38; emphasis added.]\n[67] The question is not whether commercial benefit is relevant to the analysis. The question is whether a commercial benefit is realized in the context of a defendant\u2019s commercial activities involving the patented object. The term \u201cpatented object\u201d does not designate the purpose, goal or advantage of an invention. It designates the \u201csubject-matter of the invention\u201d or the \u201cinvention\u201d itself as defined in the patent claims. Since these include, as an essential element, a water-based apparatus comprising a hull, an AER system and storage tanks, and because this apparatus did not and does not exist in Canada, the respondents realized no commercial benefit in the context of commercial activities involving the patented object.\n(4) Conclusion on the motion judge\u2019s interpretation of section 42 [68] The appellants note that, at paragraph 69 of Monsanto, the Supreme Court interpreted the words \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cexploiter\u201d as connoting \u201cutilization with a view to production or advantage\u201d. They argue that the motion judge overlooked this interpretation and erroneously applied a literal English meaning of \u201cusing\u201d to require a physical object.\n[69] Contrary to the appellants\u2019 arguments, the motion judge did not overlook the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cuse\u201d in Monsanto. He focused on the terms \u201cinvention\u201d, \u201cpatented object\u201d and \u201cpatented invention\u201d because he recognized that the primordial question under section 42 remains what must be \u201cutilized\u201d: FC Decision at para. 78. This is confirmed in paragraph 69 of Monsanto, where, having interpreted \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cexploiter\u201d as connoting \u201cutilization with a view to production and advantage,\u201d the Supreme Court applied this definition to the facts:\nSaving and planting seed, then harvesting and selling the resultant plants containing the patented cells and genes appears, on a common sense view, to constitute \u201cutilization\u201d of the patented material for production and advantage, within the meaning of s. 42.\n[Monsanto at para. 69; emphasis added.]\nMr. Schmeiser utilized the \u201cclaimed invention\u201d\u2014the patented genes and cells contained in the plants he harvested and sold\u2014not the goal, purpose or advantage of this invention.\n[70] The appellants claim that, by finding that infringement could be proven only if the appellants establish that the defendants had used the physical object (the LNG plant), the motion judge relied on a mistaken reading of the word \u201cobject\u201d in Monsanto, conflating it with a physical object rather than the \u201cgoal\u201d or \u201cpurpose\u201d of the invention.\n[71] As the foregoing analysis lays bare, the appellants\u2019 novel and expansive interpretation of the terms \u201cobjet de l\u2019invention\u201d and \u201cobjet\u201d as connoting the invention\u2019s goal, purpose or advantage is without foundation. These terms designate the invention claimed by the patent.\n[72] The motion judge found that the 085 Patent does not claim \u201cthe conceptual design of the LNG facility invention\u201d. Rather, it includes four independent claims that include \u201can apparatus, either independently or used in a system or method, for the liquefaction of natural gas\u201d. One of the essential elements of the claimed invention is a water-based apparatus comprising a hull, an AER system and storage tanks. To prove infringement, the appellants had to show that this essential element of the claimed invention was \u201cutilized with a view to production or advantage\u201d. The motion judge did not err in finding that they had failed to do so.\nC. The motion judge did not err in distinguishing the Eurocopter decision [73] The appellants argue that the respondents\u2019 activities are indistinguishable in principle from those undertaken by the defendant in Eurocopter. In Eurocopter, the defendant had produced 21 \u201cLegacy gears\u201d, landing gears designed for its new Bell 429 helicopter. The plaintiffs alleged that these infringed their patent for an innovative skid-type landing gear for light helicopters. As a defence to the allegations of infringement, the defendant argued that it had sold none of the Legacy gears to customers. Rather, it had used 20 of the gears for various tests related to obtaining certification of the Bell 429 helicopter and its activities thus fell within the \u201cregulatory or experimentation\u201d exception described by subsection 55.2(1) of the Act:\nException\nException\n55.2 (1) It is not an infringement of a patent for any person to make, construct, use or sell the patented invention solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information required under any law of Canada, a province or a country other than Canada that regulates the manufacture, construction, use or sale of any product.\n55.2 (1) Il n\u2019y a pas contrefa\u00e7on de brevet lorsque l\u2019utilisation, la fabrication, la construction ou la vente d\u2019une invention brevet\u00e9e se justifie dans la seule mesure n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration et \u00e0 la production du dossier d\u2019information qu\u2019oblige \u00e0 fournir une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, provinciale ou \u00e9trang\u00e8re r\u00e9glementant la fabrication, la construction, l\u2019utilisation ou la vente d\u2019un produit.\n[74] The Federal Court held that the defendant\u2019s activities involving the Legacy gear did not fit within the regulatory or experimentation exception:\nAt least one of the twenty-one gears was used on a non-test aircraft (57704) and was used for a static display at a trade show. Moreover, soliciting advanced orders, signing agreements with clients and promoting a new model of helicopter with a landing gear at trade shows clearly go beyond what both the Act and the common law intended by the above exceptions. During Mr. Kohler\u2019s testimony, it was revealed that each purchase agreement for the Bell 429 involved a deposit of $25,000, and that in October 2007, Bell had approximately $6 million in deposits.\nAfter an examination of the totality of the evidence, the Court finds that Bell did not construct, used or sold the Legacy gear solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information required by law. This is sufficient to render Bell ineligible for the regulatory or common law experimental exception.\n[Eurocopter at paras. 267\u201368; emphasis in original.]\n[75] The appellants claim that the motion judge erred in distinguishing the respondents\u2019 activities from those of the defendant in Eurocopter on the basis that \u201cthe patented object was made, in the alleged infringer\u2019s possession, and was exposed for sale\u201d: FC Decision at para. 86. In their view, \u201c[i]t was not the physical existence of the infringing landing gear that led the court to find infringing \u2018use\u2019,\u201d but the fact that \u201cthe defendant gained a commercial benefit from regulatory approval and the ability to credibly promote and solicit pre-orders with a valuable and marketable technology\u201d [emphasis added].\n[76] This claim must also fail. In Eurocopter, the Federal Court decided that the regulatory or experimentation exception did not apply; it did not pronounce itself on whether the defendant\u2019s use of the Legacy gear was infringing or on the question of what constituted infringing use. The Court had already determined that the Legacy gear fell within the scope of the claims of the plaintiff\u2019s patent, and that the defendant had chosen the Legacy gear for its Bell 429 helicopter, had manufactured 21 Legacy gears, and was waiting for certification of the Bell 429 to sell its new helicopters with the Legacy gear. It did not have to decide whether the defendant\u2019s promotional activities constituted infringing use to dispose of the defendant\u2019s defence to infringement under subsection 55.2(1). It merely found that the uses to which the defendant had put the Legacy gear were not solely uses related to the development and submission of information as required by the Act. Accordingly, the Eurocopter decision does not support the appellants\u2019 novel and expansive interpretation of \u201cuse\u201d.\n[77] If anything, as noted by the motion judge, the facts in Eurocopter more closely resemble Dunlop. There, the defendant used an invention (the pneumatic tires) to present its goods (its automobiles) for sale, intending the thing exhibited to represent what it was going to sell. The court held that there was \u201cuser\u201d of the invention since part of the thing exhibited was an infringing article and the article was serving a useful purpose during that time by being exhibited as part of the automobile. Unlike the case at bar, both Dunlop and Eurocopter involved the display of the physical infringing article for promotional purposes.\nD. The motion judge\u2019s interpretation of section 42 does not frustrate the patent bargain [78] The appellants claim that the motion judge\u2019s interpretation of section 42 as requiring the appellants to demonstrate that the respondents had utilized the invention claimed by the patent (in this case an LNG facility) should be rejected because it fails to consider the patent bargain.\n[79] The patent bargain was described by the Supreme Court in Nova Chemicals Corp. v. Dow Chemical Co., 2022 SCC 43, [2022] S.C.J. No. 43 at para. 43:\nThe Patent Act is designed to encourage research and development. It does this through the \u201cpatent bargain\u201d: an inventor discloses their useful invention to the public in exchange for a time-limited market monopoly on that invention. This bargain mutually benefits the public and the inventor. The public benefits by receiving innovations in science and technology. The inventor benefits because they receive a time-limited market monopoly. The inventor can use the monopoly to generate profits and compensate themselves for the time, effort and risk associated with making the invention.\n[Citations omitted.]\n[80] The appellants claim that they met their end of the bargain when they published their patent, disclosing the fruits of their labour in developing and validating, over several years and at great cost, their solution for a cost-effective FLNG facility suitable for conditions in coastal British Columbia, incurring the necessary time, effort and risk of invention.\n[81] In the appellants\u2019 view, the respondents used Steelhead\u2019s FLNG design to establish credibility with stakeholders and potential partners, allowing them to conclude a commercially valuable |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| and to advance their project enough to entice Western LNG to enter into a commercially valuable transaction. As a result, the appellants claim, without even constructing an infringing FLNG facility, the respondents derived a commercial benefit from the appellants\u2019 labour, thus interfering with the appellants\u2019 time-limited monopoly to build market share without competition.\n[82] Under section 42 of the Act, in return for disclosing their invention, the appellants acquired \u201ca limited monopoly for a limited time\u201d: Apotex Inc. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd., 2002 SCC 77, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 153 at para. 37. As established in the foregoing analysis, the \u201cexclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing and using the invention and selling it to others to be used\u201d extends to the claimed invention\u2014the subject matter of the invention defined by the patent claims\u2014not the invention\u2019s goal, purpose or advantage. The patent does not claim the conceptual design of the appellants\u2019 LNG facility. It claims, among other things, a water-based apparatus for the liquefaction of natural gas, comprising a hull, an AER system and storage tanks. The motion judge did not err in finding that the respondents did not use the claimed invention.\n[83] By arguing that patent protection should extend to an invention\u2019s goal, purpose or advantage, the appellants seek to prevent competitors from using the idea or concept underlying their invention for commercial advantage. Under their proposed interpretation, section 42 would prevent competitors from relying on the inventive solutions laid out in a patent disclosure as a proof of concept to show that their own particular product idea or project plan is achievable in order to generate business interest or secure financial support to develop, by designing around the patent, a non-infringing alternative. Finding a different way to accomplish the benefit of an invention by designing around a patent does not constitute infringement since the protection of the patent \u201clies not in the identification of a desirable result but in teaching one particular means to achieve it\u201d: Free World Trust at para. 32; Deeproot Green Infrastructure, LLC v. Greenblue Urban North America Inc., 2023 FCA 185, [2023] F.C.J. No. 1312 at para. 42, citing Illinois Tool Works v. Cobra Fixations Cie, 2002 FCT 829, 221 F.T.R. 161 at paras. 14\u201317, aff\u2019d 2003 FCA 358, [2003] F.C.J. No. 1477. The interpretive outcome sought by the appellants would frustrate, not enforce, the patent bargain.\n[84] In a related argument, the appellants claim that the motion judge\u2019s view that protection against infringement by use can only be afforded once a person has assembled the physical apparatus claimed by the patent would give rise to two-tiered patent protection, where the effective length of the monopoly conferred on the patentee would depend on the size, complexity and construction cost of the patented invention. For a large and complex FLNG facility that takes a decade to construct, no patent protection would effectively be afforded until year 10 of the 20\u2011year monopoly period, when the infringing facility would be complete, effectively reducing the duration of patent protection for large, complex or hard-to-build inventions. The appellants argue that, for the purpose of deciding whether a person has infringed the patent by using the invention, there is no principled distinction between 1) that person showing prospective buyers or investors, to its commercial benefit, a helicopter outfitted with an \u201ceasy-to-make\u201d patented landing gear and 2) that person showing to stakeholders and investors the conceptual design of an FLNG facility that includes all the essential characteristics described in the patent\u2019s claims. In the appellants\u2019 view, both scenarios disclose infringement by use. The motion judge\u2019s insistence that infringement can only be found where a physical prototype is built leaves inventions too large, complex or expensive to prototype without the protection afforded by patent law to smaller, easy-to-prototype inventions.\n[85] Patent law does not discriminate between various categories of inventions. The Act grants to all patentees, for a limited time, the exclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing and using the invention claimed in the patent and selling it to others to be used. Should anyone seek to use, during the 20-year term of the 085 Patent, an infringing FLNG plant, the appellants could initiate a quia timet proceeding or, following such use, sue for infringement. If successful, they could seek to recover the portion of the infringer\u2019s profits which are causally attributable to the invention, including \u201cspringboard profits\u201d arising post-patent-expiry that the infringers would not have earned but for the infringing activity that occurred during the life of the patent: Nova Chemicals at paras. 46, 80, 82.\n[86] Under the appellants\u2019 proposed construction of \u201cuse\u201d, patentees could bring claims of infringement against competitors carrying out design or conceptual work involving a design disclosed by a patent. If, as the appellants claim, it takes a decade to complete the work involved in building an FLNG facility, including establishing the necessary relationships and partnerships with investors and stakeholders and arriving at a feasible design for the facility, competitors would be precluded from starting this preliminary work during the term of the patent and would only be in a position to offer a competing facility a decade later, effectively extending the appellants\u2019 patent monopoly from 20 to 30 years.\n[87] In Kirkbi AG v. Ritvik Holdings Inc., 2005 SCC 65, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 302 at para. 37, the Supreme Court observed that:\nThe economic value of intellectual property rights arouses the imagination and litigiousness of rights holders in their search for continuing protection of what they view as their rightful property. Such a search carries with it the risk of discarding basic and necessary distinctions between different forms of intellectual property and their legal and economic functions.\n[88] The subject matter and time-limited monopoly granted by the Act does not offer the protection that the appellants are seeking. Recourse may lie elsewhere, in the protection of other forms of intellectual property including copyright and moral rights, or in the enforcement of any non-disclosure agreements between the parties respecting the treatment and use of confidential information acquired by the parties in the course of their business dealings. The appellants have in fact commenced proceedings against the respondents to pursue such claims before the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\nV. Conclusion [89] For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that this appeal should be dismissed, with costs to the respondents.\n[90] Since I have found that the motion judge did not err in rejecting the appellants\u2019 novel and expansive interpretation of \u201cuse\u201d under section 42 of the Act, it follows that the appellants\u2019 motion to file new evidence to establish \u201cuse\u201d based on this erroneous interpretation should also be dismissed, with costs to the respondents.\n\u201cGerald Heckman\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nYves de Montigny C.J.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nNathalie Goyette J.A.\u201d\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-210-22\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nSTEELHEAD LNG (ASLNG) LTD. et al. v.

The Board summarily dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint that his former union, the Public Service Alliance of Canada, had failed in its duty of fair representation, under section 187 of the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 2, in relation to his 1997 termination grievance. The applicant argues that the Board\u2019s process was unfair and that its decision was unreasonable.\n[2] The applicant brought a motion to admit as new evidence two letters dated 1993, relating to the applicant\u2019s termination grievance. The respondent opposed the motion. Generally, evidence on a judicial review application is limited to what was before the decision-maker, as the reviewing Court\u2019s role is to consider the decision-maker\u2019s decision, and not decide the issue afresh: Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright), 2012 FCA 22 at para. 19 [Access Copyright].\n[3] We will dismiss the motion. The letters were not before the Board and do not fall into any of the recognized exceptions for admitting evidence not before the decision-maker: Access Copyright at para. 20. We add that if admitted, they would not have affected the outcome of this application.\n[4] We reject the applicant\u2019s submissions on procedural unfairness. The allegations of bias and conflict of interest are not supported by the evidence. We also see no unfairness in the Board deciding the matter without an oral hearing. The Board is expressly authorized to do so by section 22 of the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board Act, S.C. 2013, c. 40, s. 365 (FPSLREBA). Further, the Board had no duty to investigate; it relies solely on the evidence submitted by the parties.\n[5] Returning to the merits of the judicial review, the standard of review for the Board\u2019s substantive decision is reasonableness: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at para. 16 [Vavilov]; Andrews v. Public Service Alliance of Canada, 2022 FCA 159 at para. 25.\n[6] We do not accept that the Board\u2019s decision was unreasonable. Under section 21 of the FPSLREBA, the Board may \u201cdismiss summarily any matter that in its opinion is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or was made in bad faith.\u201d It was entirely reasonable for the Board to conclude that the applicant had no arguable case. Fundamentally, the complaint was an attempt to relitigate issues decided more than twenty years ago.\n[7] As noted by the Board, the applicant\u2019s termination grievance was dismissed in 1997, and a judicial review application was struck by the Federal Court as having no reasonable prospect of success: [1997] C.P.S.S.R.B. No. 107 and 1998 CanLII 7355 (FC), respectively. This Court upheld the Federal Court\u2019s decision: 2000 CanLII 15103 (FCA), 180 F.T.R. 149.\n[8] In 2000, the applicant made a fair representation complaint that was substantially similar to the one at issue here, based on dissatisfaction with his counsel\u2019s handling of the 1997 termination grievance. The Board dismissed the complaint, brought three years after the relevant events, for delay: 2001 PSSRB 86. The applicant\u2019s judicial review application was dismissed: 2003 FCA 113.\n[9] Given these circumstances, and the lack of new evidence or argument, the Board reasonably concluded that the applicant was \u201cattempting to revive a matter that was settled long ago\u201d and that there was no arguable case, even assuming the applicant\u2019s allegations to be true: Board Reasons at paras. 5, 26-27, and 29.\n[10] In our view, the applicant has not identified any reviewable error in the Board\u2019s decision. The Board\u2019s reasons for summarily dismissing the complaint bear the hallmarks of reasonableness\u2014justification, transparency, and intelligibility\u2014and are justified in relation to the factual and legal constraints, including the interest in the finality of decisions: Vavilov at para. 99.\n[11] For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss the application and the motion, without costs.\n\u201cMonica Biringer\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-165-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nVICTOR WALCOTT v.

MONAGHAN J.A.\nDate: 20240412\nDocket: A-148-20\nCitation: 2024 FCA 69\nCORAM:\nLASKIN J.A.\nMACTAVISH J.A.\nMONAGHAN J.A.\nBETWEEN:\nTHE MINISTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS\nAppellant\nand\nMEDHANIE AREGAWI WELDEMARIAM\nRespondent\nand\nCANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF REFUGEE LAWYERS and UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES\nInterveners\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nMACTAVISH J.A.\n[1] In accordance with paragraphs 34(1)(a) and (f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA), permanent residents and foreign nationals are inadmissible to Canada on security grounds if they are members of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged or will engage in espionage \u201cagainst Canada or that is contrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d.\n[2] Medhanie Aregawi Weldemariam does not now dispute that he was a \u201cmember of an organization\u201d that has engaged in espionage, as contemplated by paragraph 34(1)(f) of IRPA. The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness does not allege that the espionage carried out by the organization in question was \u201cagainst Canada\u201d. The sole issue on this appeal is thus whether the Immigration Division (ID) of the Immigration and Refugee Board reasonably found that the espionage in issue was \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA. The ID based its inadmissibility finding on an interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) that did not require the espionage in issue to have a nexus to Canada\u2019s national security.\n[3] In a decision reported as 2020 FC 631 (Weldemariam FC), the Federal Court concluded that the ID\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) was unreasonable, and that the phrase \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d requires a nexus to Canada\u2019s security interests. Consequently, the Federal Court quashed the ID\u2019s decision and remitted Mr. Weldemariam\u2019s case to the ID for redetermination.\n[4] In rendering judgment allowing Mr. Weldemariam\u2019s application for judicial review, the Court certified the following question:\nIs a person inadmissible to Canada pursuant to paragraph 34(1)(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act for being a member of an organization with respect to which there are reasonable grounds to believe it has engaged in, engages in, or will engage in acts of espionage that are \u201ccontrary to Canada's interests\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 34(1)(a) of the Act if the organization\u2019s espionage activities take place outside Canada and target foreign nationals in a manner that is contrary to the values that underlie the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the democratic character of Canada, including the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by paragraph 2(b) of the Charter?\n[5] For the reasons that follow, I find that the Federal Court did not err in finding that the ID\u2019s decision was unreasonable, and in concluding that the phrase \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d requires a nexus to Canada\u2019s national security or the security of Canada. I am satisfied that the ID failed to have regard to legal constraints imposed on it by international law, in particular the non\u2011refoulement provisions of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, Can. T.S. 1969 No. 6 (Refugee Convention), as well as recognized principles of statutory interpretation.\n[6] Consequently, I would answer the certified question in the negative, and would dismiss the appeal.\nI. Background [7] Mr. Weldemariam is an Ethiopian citizen and a former employee of the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), an Ethiopian state security and intelligence agency. Mr. Weldemariam worked for INSA as a software developer, where, he says, he worked on the development of air defense simulation software used in training members of the military.\n[8] Mr. Weldemariam worked at INSA until mid-2014, when he left Ethiopia for Sweden in order to pursue graduate studies. He returned to Ethiopia in 2016, after completing his studies. Mr. Weldemariam came to Canada in 2017, whereupon he made a claim for refugee protection. He alleged that he was at risk of persecution by Ethiopian security forces, which, he says, had targeted him after he returned to Ethiopia from Sweden.\n[9] Mr. Weldemariam\u2019s refugee claim was held in abeyance while the Minister inquired into his admissibility to Canada in light of his employment with INSA. The ID then held a hearing with respect to Mr. Weldemariam\u2019s admissibility.\nII. The Immigration Division\u2019s Decision [10] As noted by the ID in its decision (reported as X (Re), 2019 CanLII 135483), Mr. Weldemariam had conceded that his employment with INSA was sufficient to constitute membership in an organization for the purposes of paragraph 34(1)(f) of IRPA. This provides that foreign nationals are inadmissible on security grounds for \u201cbeing a member of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged or will engage in acts referred to in paragraph (a) [\u2026]\u201d.\n[11] Consequently, the determinative issues before the ID were whether there were reasonable grounds to believe that the activities of INSA constituted espionage and, if so, whether such activities were \u201cagainst Canada or [\u2026] contrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d.\n[12] In Mugesera v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 40, the Supreme Court of Canada described the \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d evidentiary standard as requiring \u201csomething more than mere suspicion, but less than the standard applicable in civil matters of proof on the balance of probabilities\u201d. The Supreme Court went on in Mugesera to hold that reasonable grounds to believe will exist \u201cwhere there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information\u201d: at para. 114.\n[13] The ID determined that there were reasonable grounds to believe that INSA had covertly gathered information from Ethiopian Satellite Television (ESAT) employees in the United States and Belgium. ESAT is an independent satellite, radio, television and online news outlet run by members of the Ethiopian diaspora in a number of countries, including the United States and Canada.\n[14] INSA gathered information using offensive cyber capabilities and surveillance malware, targeting journalists and political dissidents. From this, the ID was satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to believe that INSA had engaged in \u201cespionage\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA. There was no evidence before the ID, however, to suggest that Mr. Weldemariam had any personal involvement in any of INSA\u2019s espionage activities, and the ID made no finding to this effect.\n[15] While ESAT is active in Canada, the ID found that no evidence had been adduced to show that INSA had deployed hacking software on ESAT employees in Canada, or that it had otherwise targeted ESAT journalists in this country. Consequently, the ID did not find that INSA\u2019s actions were directed \u201cagainst Canada\u201d. The question for determination was thus whether INSA\u2019s actions were nevertheless \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA.\n[16] Although the individuals targeted by INSA were located outside of Canada, the ID found that INSA\u2019s acts of espionage against Ethiopian journalists and political dissidents in the United States were \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d, as they were carried out \u201cagainst nationals of countries allied to Canada\u201d: at para. 34.\n[17] The ID further found that \u201c[t]he fundamental freedoms [of] opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication are a cornerstone of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\u201d: at para. 34. As such, the ID was satisfied that the acts of espionage engaged in by INSA against members of ESAT were \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d, as that phrase is used in paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA.\n[18] The ID thus concluded that Mr. Weldemariam was inadmissible to Canada for being a member of an organization that engages in acts of espionage that are contrary to Canada\u2019s interests, as contemplated by paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA.\nIII. The Federal Court\u2019s Decision [19] The Federal Court noted that Mr. Weldemariam\u2019s membership in INSA was no longer in issue, nor was the fact that INSA had engaged in espionage. There was also no suggestion that INSA\u2019s acts had been directed \u201cagainst Canada\u201d. Consequently, the only finding made by the ID that was in issue before the Federal Court was its determination that INSA\u2019s activities were \u201ccontrary to the interests of Canada\u201d.\n[20] The Federal Court identified reasonableness as the standard to be applied in reviewing the ID\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA. The Court concluded that ID\u2019s decision was not reasonable, as it had given an unreasonably broad interpretation to the phrase \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d as it appears in that provision. Consequently, the decision was quashed, and Mr. Weldemariam\u2019s case was remitted to the ID for redetermination.\n[21] The Federal Court found that the ID\u2019s decision was unreasonable in three respects. First, the ID failed to consider the history and purpose of paragraph 34(1)(a), which demonstrated that the provision was introduced to constrain determinations of inadmissibility on espionage\u2011related grounds.\n[22] Second, the ID had treated \u201cCanada\u2019s interests\u201d as being equivalent to \u201cthings Canada is interested in\u201d, without considering that there must be some actual nexus to Canada for paragraph 34(1)(a) to be engaged.\n[23] Finally, relying on the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Mason v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 1251, the Federal Court found in Mr. Weldemariam\u2019s case that a nexus with national security was required to bring a matter within the scope of subsection 34(1) of IRPA. The Court further found that the ID failed to explain the nexus between the actions of INSA and Canada\u2019s national security.\n[24] The Federal Court recognized that espionage activity directed against Canada\u2019s allies may be contrary to Canada\u2019s interests, and that the targeting of an ally could easily be understood as engaging Canada\u2019s national security. However, INSA was not targeting the United States or Belgium\u2014it was targeting private individuals who were merely residing in these countries.\n[25] In the Federal Court\u2019s view, it was \u201csomething else entirely\u201d to suggest that Canada\u2019s national security interests are engaged by the targeting of individuals who are nationals or residents of one of its allies, rather than by the targeting of the ally itself. The Federal Court held that at the very least, it was necessary for the ID to provide a reasonable explanation of the nexus between the targeting of individuals in other countries and Canada\u2019s national security interests for the decision to withstand review. As no such explanation had been provided by the ID, the Federal Court found that its decision lacked justification, transparency, and intelligibility, and Mr. Weldemariam\u2019s application for judicial review was therefore granted.\nIV. The Issue [26] As noted earlier, the sole issue before this Court is whether the ID\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA was reasonable, and whether a nexus to Canada\u2019s national security or security interests is required with respect to \u201cCanada\u2019s interests\u201d, in order to bring an act of espionage within the scope of that provision.\nV. The Standard of Review [27] This Court\u2019s role in an appeal such as this is to determine whether the Federal Court identified the correct standard of review\u2014correctness or reasonableness\u2014and whether it properly applied that standard: Northern Regional Health Authority v. Horrocks, 2021 SCC 42 at paras. 10-12; Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36 at paras. 45-47. This has been described as requiring us to \u201cstep into the shoes\u201d of the Federal Court judge, focusing on the administrative decision below.\n[28] This Court has previously expressed concerns with respect to the application of the reasonableness standard in the context of questions certified by the Federal Court under the provisions of subsection 74(d) of IRPA. This is especially so where, as here, this Court is called upon to answer questions of statutory interpretation that require a yes or no answer: see, e.g. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Galindo Camayo, 2022 FCA 50 at paras. 40\u201144. See also the dissenting opinion of Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 in Mason v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 21 at paras. 126, 152 (Mason). Nevertheless, the majority decision in Mason affirms that reasonableness is the standard to be applied by reviewing courts in addressing certified questions in the immigration context.\n[29] Consequently, I agree with the parties that the Federal Court correctly identified reasonableness as the standard to be applied in reviewing the ID\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA, specifically the phrase \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d as it appears in that provision. The question for determination is thus whether the Federal Court properly applied that standard in this case.\nVI. A Preliminary Comment [30] Before commencing my analysis, it is important to note that neither the ID nor the Federal Court had the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Mason. There, the Court was called upon to interpret paragraph 34(1)(e) of IRPA, which makes permanent residents and foreign nationals inadmissible to Canada on security grounds for \u201cengaging in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada\u201d.\n[31] The Supreme Court concluded in Mason that there was only one reasonable interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(e) of IRPA, namely one that requires a nexus to national security or the security of Canada: above at para. 121.\n[32] The implications that Mason has for the interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA, and the reasonableness of the ID\u2019s understanding of what it means for an act of espionage to be \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d are in dispute, and will be discussed in the next section of these reasons.\nVII. Analysis [33] The parties and the interveners have raised a number of issues with respect to the interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA. These include arguments related to the text, context and purpose of the provision, as well as submissions based upon international law. I will deal with the international law issue first.\nA. The International Law Argument [34] In Mason, the Supreme Court forcefully reminded us of the importance of international law as a useful tool in interpreting domestic legislation: Mason, above at paras. 104-117. There, the Supreme Court observed that in its earlier decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, it had stated that international law may impose an important constraint on administrative decision makers as a result of the presumption that domestic legislation will operate in conformity with Canada\u2019s international obligations: Mason at para. 105; Vavilov at para. 114.\n[35] In this case, the Minister submitted that the determinative issues in Mason related to the failure of the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board to address two \u201csignificant points of statutory context\u201d. These had been raised by Mr. Mason in support of his contention that, properly interpreted, paragraph 34(1)(e) of IRPA requires a nexus with national security or the security of Canada. The Supreme Court held that the failure of the IAD to deal with these arguments had resulted in a failure of responsive justification, causing it to lose confidence in the IAD\u2019s decision: Mason, above at para. 10.\n[36] From this, the Minister seemed to be suggesting that the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of international law in Mason was essentially obiter.\n[37] I do not agree.\n[38] It is clear from the discussion at paragraphs 104-117 of the reasons in Mason that international law played a central role in the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis. At paragraph 118 of its reasons, the Court referenced the failure of the IAD to address arguments that Mr. Mason had raised in his written submissions. In the same paragraph, however, the Court went on to refer to the IAD\u2019s failure to interpret and apply paragraph 34(1)(e) in compliance with Canada\u2019s obligation of non-refoulement under the Refugee Convention. The Court then stated \u201c[c]umulatively, these omissions rendered the IAD\u2019s decision unreasonable\u201d [my emphasis].\n[39] From this it is clear that international law played a central role in the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in Mason that the IAD\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(e) was unreasonable, and that it formed part of the ratio of the decision.\n[40] The Minister acknowledges that there is an obligation on administrative decision makers to render decisions that are compliant with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11, and with international human rights obligations binding on Canada. He submits, however, that this should not impose an additional burden on such decision makers to consider arguments that the parties never raised.\n[41] This argument cannot succeed. It is not open to this Court to disregard the express teachings of the Supreme Court with respect to the duty on immigration adjudicators to construe and apply IRPA in a manner that complies with the international human rights instruments to which Canada is signatory: see Mason, above at para. 104.\n[42] The Minister also argued that the reasonableness of the ID\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) in this case should not turn on whether it considered the principle of non-refoulement. This, the Minister says, is because the determination of admissibility is distinct from the removal process, and the ID\u2019s finding that Mr. Weldemariam is inadmissible to Canada does not put him on a path to removal so as to trigger the principle of non-refoulement.\n[43] However, the same may be said of a finding under paragraph 34(1)(e) of IRPA. The Supreme Court was nevertheless of the view that international law principles, including the principle of non-refoulement, should guide the interpretation of that provision: Mason, above at paras. 109-111.\n[44] Specifically, the Supreme Court held in Mason that paragraph 34(1)(e) of IRPA had to be interpreted in a manner that complied with Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention, which creates an exception to the principle of non-refoulement, permitting the removal of individuals who constitute a danger to the community of the host country: Mason, above at paras. 107-111.\n[45] Article 1 of the Refugee Convention defines a \u201crefugee\u201d as an individual who has a \u201cwell\u2011founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion\u201d. Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention provides that \u201c[n]o Contracting State shall expel or return (\u201crefouler\u201d) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion\u201d.\n[46] In Mason, the Supreme Court described the principle of non-refoulement as the \u201ccentrepiece\u201d of the Refugee Convention and \u201cthe cornerstone of the international refugee protection regime\u201d: above at paras. 107-108.\n[47] There is, however, an exception to the principle of non-refoulement. That is, Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention provides that its protection may not be claimed by a refugee for whom \u201cthere are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he is\u201d. Also excluded from the protection of the Refugee Convention are those \u201cwho, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of that country\u201d.\n[48] The Minister submits that IRPA includes safeguards that would be available down the road that would protect Mr. Weldemariam against refoulement. As a result, he says that interpreting paragraph 34(1)(a) without requiring a nexus to Canada\u2019s national security or security interests at the admissibility stage would not contravene Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention.\n[49] However, the Supreme Court carefully assessed the ability of potential \u201csafety valves\u201d to ensure compliance with Canada\u2019s international obligations under the Refugee Convention in Mason. In so doing, the Court examined the structure of IRPA, including the interaction between its inadmissibility provisions and the purported safety valves available during the removal process.\n[50] The Supreme Court specifically rejected the argument that processes available after a finding of inadmissibility under paragraph 34(1)(e) provide adequate protection against refoulement. Indeed, the Court expressly found that none of these processes ensured compliance with Canada\u2019s international legal obligations under the Refugee Convention: Mason, above at paras. 110-114. These processes are similar to those that would be available to Mr. Weldemariam following an inadmissibility finding under paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA.\n[51] From this, I am satisfied that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Mason requires that this Court consider Canada\u2019s obligations under the Refugee Convention, and, in particular, the principle of non-refoulement, in assessing the reasonableness of the ID\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA at the admissibility stage of the process.\n[52] Before commencing this assessment, however, and in fairness to the ID, I should note that the utility of international law as an interpretive aid does not appear to have been raised before it in Mr. Weldemariam\u2019s case. The Supreme Court nevertheless held in Mason that the principle of non-refoulement is a critical legal constraint on interpretation of IRPA\u2014one that Parliament has mandated that immigration adjudicators consider in interpreting the legislation: IRPA at paras. 3(2)(b) and 3(3)(f); Mason, above at paras. 85, 106, 117 and 118; B010 v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 58 at para. 49.\n[53] The Refugee Convention is thus determinative of how IRPA is to be interpreted, in the absence of a contrary legislative intention: Mason, above at para. 106; de Guzman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FCA 436 at para. 87; B010, above at para. 49. Neither the parties nor the interveners have identified any legislative provision that would evidence such a contrary intent on the part of Parliament.\n[54] Canada has ratified both the Refugee Convention and the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, Can. T.S. 1969 No. 29. These international human rights instruments trigger the interpretive presumption of conformity with international law: Mason, above at para. 105; N\u00e9meth v. Canada (Justice), 2010 SCC 56, at para. 17.\n[55] As noted, Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention enshrines the ban on refoulement, prohibiting contracting states from expelling or returning refugees to countries where their lives or freedoms would be threatened on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\n[56] Again as noted earlier, Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention creates limited exceptions to the principle of non-refoulement, allowing refugees to be refouled where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person poses a danger to the security of the host country or has been convicted of a serious crime: Mason at para. 109; Febles v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 SCC 68 at para. 25.\n[57] As a result, a finding of inadmissibility under either paragraphs 34(1)(a) or 34(1)(e) of IRPA can effectively deny a person access to Canada\u2019s refugee procedures and protections.\n[58] The Supreme Court observed in Mason that if paragraph 34(1)(e) were interpreted as not requiring a nexus to Canada\u2019s national security or security interests, a foreign national could be deported to persecution once they have been found to be inadmissible under that provision. This could occur without there ever being a finding that the person poses a danger to the security of Canada or has been convicted of a serious crime. This is because the exceptions under Article 33(2) would not apply: Mason, above at para. 109.\n[59] The same analysis would apply in the case of inadmissibility under paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA.\n[60] In this case, the ID interpreted the phrase \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d in paragraph 34(1)(a) as encompassing a broad range of Canada\u2019s interests, including activities that are contrary to the values enshrined in the Charter. This interpretation could subject individuals to being deported to persecution once they have been found to be inadmissible under paragraph 34(1)(a) for being engaged in activities that were contrary to Canada\u2019s interests, without there ever being a finding that there were reasonable grounds to believe that they pose a danger to the security of Canada. This is because, under this interpretation, the exceptions under Article 33(2) would not apply.\n[61] In other words, the ID\u2019s interpretation would allow the refoulement of persons inadmissible under paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA in circumstances that are outside the scope of the Article 33(2) exceptions.\n[62] In contrast, interpreting paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA as requiring a nexus with Canada\u2019s national security or security interests would bring the provision into conformity with Article 33 of the Refugee Convention. In accordance with this interpretation, a person found inadmissible under paragraph 34(1)(a) for being engaged in activities that were contrary to Canada\u2019s national security or security interests would come within the security exception to the principle of non\u2011refoulement enshrined in Article 33(2): Mason, above at para. 109. The result of this would be that a removal order in such cases would not breach Canada\u2019s obligation of non-refoulement: Mason, above at para. 111.\n[63] When presented with two competing interpretations of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA, one of which would comply with the requirements of Article 33 of the Refugee Convention and one of which would not, the interpretation that would comply with Canada\u2019s international commitments, including its non-refoulement obligations, should be utilized.\n[64] As the Supreme Court observed in Mason, the failure of the ID to consider the role of the Refugee Convention in constraining the interpretation of IRPA was not a minor omission, but a crucial one\u2014one that overlooks the principle of non-refoulement\u2014the very cornerstone of the international refugee protection regime: Mason, above at para. 108; N\u00e9meth, above at paras. 18\u201119. The ID thus ignored a critical constraint on the interpretation of IRPA\u2014one that Parliament has expressly stated must be considered by immigration adjudicators in construing and applying the Act: Mason, above at para. 117. This makes the ID\u2019s decision in this case unreasonable.\n[65] This finding provides a sufficient basis for upholding the Federal Court\u2019s decision to set aside the ID\u2019s decision in Mr. Weldemariam\u2019s case. However, a number of other arguments were advanced by the parties and the interveners with respect to the interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a). These arguments will be considered in assessing whether there is more than one reasonable interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA.\nB. The Other Statutory Interpretation Issues [66] As the Supreme Court has stated, reviewing courts must take a \u201creasons first\u201d approach in reviewing administrative decisions. That is, the reviewing Court must start by examining the reasons provided by the administrative decision maker, paying them \u201crespectful attention\u201d, seeking to \u201cunderstand the reasoning process followed by the decision maker to arrive at its conclusion\u201d: Mason, above at para. 60; Vavilov, above at para. 84; Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 at para. 48.\n[67] The Supreme Court has further stated that a reasonable decision is one \u201cbased on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis [\u2026] that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker\u201d: Vavilov, above at para. 85.\n[68] In this case, the ID\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) was largely based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Agraira, above, which dealt with an earlier version of the Ministerial relief provision in IRPA, and on the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) Operational Manual ENF 2\/OP 18-Evaluating Inadmissibility. The Operational Manual sets out a non-exhaustive list of things that, in CIC\u2019s view, may constitute espionage that is contrary to Canada\u2019s interests.\n[69] Insofar as the ID\u2019s reliance on Agraira is concerned, it found the Supreme Court\u2019s comments in that case with respect to the meaning of the phrase \u201ccontrary to the national interest\u201d as they appeared in subsection 34(2) of IRPA to be helpful in defining \u201cCanada\u2019s interests\u201d in assessing inadmissibility under paragraph 34(1)(a).\n[70] Subsection 34(2) (which was repealed in 2013) provided that the Minister could exempt an individual from an inadmissibility finding if the individual could satisfy the Minister \u201cthat their presence in Canada would not be detrimental to the national interest\u201d.\n[71] Quoting at length from paragraph 65 of Agraira, the ID noted the Supreme Court\u2019s statement that the \u201cnational interest\u201d refers to matters that are of concern to Canada and to Canadians. While this included public safety and national security, the plain words of the provision favoured a more expansive reading than this, and that the \u201cnational interest\u201d also included matters such as the preservation of the values that underlie the Charter and the democratic character of Canada. The ID found that INSA\u2019s espionage against members of ESAT, a media organization, ran contrary to freedom of the press and other media communication, a cornerstone of the Charter.\n[72] The Federal Court noted that the Charter does not apply to INSA, nor does it protect the journalists that INSA had targeted. While ESAT is active in Canada, the ID made no findings as to any impact that INSA\u2019s actions may have had on ESAT\u2019s activities in this country. Without some explanation as to how those activities were affected, if at all, by INSA\u2019s targeting of individuals in other countries, the Federal Court found that this was \u201ctoo tenuous a basis to reasonably support a finding that INSA\u2019s actions were contrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d: Weldemariam FC, above at para. 53.\n[73] The Federal Court further found that the ID\u2019s reliance on Agraira was similarly misplaced. One reason for this was that it raised a question as to the appropriateness of using a test that serves one purpose\u2014 determining whether to exempt someone from an inadmissibility finding\u2014to interpret a provision that serves an entirely different purpose: that is, determining inadmissibility: Weldemariam FC, above at para. 58.\n[74] The ID also observed that the CIC\u2019s Operational Manual stated that activities that constitute espionage \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d included the use of Canadian territory to carry out espionage activities and espionage activities committed outside Canada that have a negative impact on the safety, security or prosperity of Canada. The phrase \u201cprosperity of Canada\u201d included, but was not limited to, financial, economic, social, and cultural factors. Espionage activity did not have to be directed against the state, but could also \u201cbe against Canadian commercial or other private interests\u201d. According to the Manual, activity directed against Canada\u2019s allies could also be contrary to Canada\u2019s interests.\n[75] As the Supreme Court has previously observed, guidelines such as those found in CIC\u2019s Policy Manuals provide a useful indicator of what will constitute a reasonable interpretation of a given provision of IRPA: Kanthasamy v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 61 at para. 32. That said, CIC Policy Manuals are not legally binding on this Court: Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Kassab, 2020 FCA 10 at para. 42.\n[76] Mason tells us that administrative decision makers do not have to engage in formalistic statutory interpretation exercises in every case in the way that Courts are expected to do. Administrative decision makers\u2019 interpretation of statutory provisions must, however, be consistent with the modern principle of statutory interpretation, which focuses on the text, context, and purpose of the provision in question. That is, administrative decision makers must demonstrate in their reasons that they were alive to these elements: Mason, above at para. 69; Vavilov, above at paras. 119\u2011120.\n[77] Even if an administrative decision maker does not explicitly address the meaning of a legislative provision, the reviewing Court may be able to discern the interpretation adopted from the record, and to evaluate whether it is reasonable: Mason, above at para. 69; Vavilov, above at para. 123.\n[78] The central question is whether the missing analysis \u201ccauses the reviewing court to lose confidence in the outcome reached by the decision maker\u201d: Mason, above at para. 69; Vavilov, above at para. 122.\n[79] I have already addressed the ID\u2019s failure to have regard to the constraints imposed by the non-refoulement provision of the Refugee Convention in interpreting paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA. The question at this stage of the analysis is whether the failure of the ID to address other principles of statutory interpretation leads to a further loss of confidence in the ID\u2019s decision.\n[80] When conducting reasonableness review, reviewing courts must be mindful of the consequences of the decision at issue on the rights and interests of affected individuals: Mason at para. 81; Vavilov at para. 133. That is, where a decision has particularly harsh consequences for an affected individual, \u201cresponsive justification\u201d requires that the decision maker explain why its decision best reflects Parliament\u2019s intent: Mason, above at para. 76; Vavilov, above at para. 133.\n[81] The interests here are serious: the result of the ID\u2019s inadmissibility finding is that Mr. Weldemariam is now on a path to removal to a country where it is alleged he will face persecution. The ID\u2019s reasons were thus required to reflect what was at stake: Mason, above at paras. 76, 81.\n[82] In addition to not considering the significant legal constraint on the interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) imposed by the requirement that IRPA operate in conformity with Canada\u2019s international obligations, the ID also failed to consider several recognized techniques of statutory interpretation.\n[83] The text at issue in this case is contained in paragraphs 34(1)(a) and (f) of IRPA. As noted earlier, these make permanent residents and foreign nationals inadmissible to Canada on security grounds if they are members of an organization for which there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged or will engage in espionage \u201cagainst Canada or that is contrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d.\n[84] Where the words of a statutory provision are precise and unequivocal, the ordinary meaning of the words will play a dominant role in the interpretive process: Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54 at para. 10. Where, however, words in a statutory provision are capable of supporting more than one reasonable meaning, the ordinary meaning of the words plays a lesser role in the statutory interpretation analysis.\n[85] There is no dispute that the phrase \u201cagainst Canada\u201d in the first part of paragraph 34(1)(a) refers to espionage that is directed against Canada.\n[86] The phrase \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d is not defined in Division 4 of IRPA, which is the section governing inadmissibility, and, as is evident from this case, there is a debate as to its scope. The question is whether \u201cCanada\u2019s interests\u201d refers to a broad range of matters of interest to Canada, including compliance with Charter values and the preservation of the democratic character of Canada (as the ID found and as the Minister argues), or is limited to Canada\u2019s national security or security interests (as Mr. Weldemariam contends).\n[87] The Minister argues that even if one were to accept that the inclusion of \u201cSecurity\u201d as the heading of subsection 34(1) signals that each provision in the subsection deals with matters of national security, that does not mean that engaging in espionage that \u201cis contrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d must also have a specific national security orientation. This is especially so, the Minister says, given that the reference to espionage \u201cagainst Canada\u201d already provides this direct national security nexus.\n[88] Had Parliament intended the phrase \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d in paragraph 34(1)(a) to require a direct nexus to Canada\u2019s national security or security interests, the Minister submits that it could easily have made that clear in the provision by prohibiting espionage, not just \u201cagainst Canada\u201d as it does, but also espionage that is inimical to Canada\u2019s national security interests. That is not, however, what Parliament did.\n[89] The Minister further submits that the use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in the phrase \u201cagainst Canada or that is contrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d [my emphasis] suggests that \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d does not require a nexus to national security, and that the two phrases should be viewed as separate and distinct.\n[90] As noted, the Minister contends that the phrase \u201cagainst Canada\u201d already refers to Canada\u2019s national security interests, and that interpreting the phrase \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d as also requiring a nexus to national security would render words of the provision superfluous and redundant, and would offend the presumption against tautology.\n[91] Having already made those whose espionage targets Canada inadmissible, the Minister contends that Parliament could not have intended that espionage that is \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d be directed to the identical type of activity. In addition to the problems noted in the previous paragraph, such an interpretation would also be contrary to the presumption of consistent expression.\n[92] The flaw in the Minister\u2019s argument is, of course, that the phrases \u201cagainst Canada\u201d and \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d do not share an identical meaning. Espionage \u201cagainst Canada\u201d clearly refers to espionage that is targeted at Canada, whereas espionage that is \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d refers to espionage that may not be targeted at Canada per se, but is nevertheless contrary to the national security or security interests of this country. It is the nature and scope of those interests that is in dispute here.\n[93] In addressing this issue, it is important to read the phrase \u201cCanada\u2019s interests\u201d in the context of the rest of subsection 34(1) and the larger context of Division 4 of IRPA, which is the part of the Act that deals with inadmissibility to Canada. Doing so makes it clear that the phrase \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d in paragraph 34(1)(a) refers to Canada\u2019s security interests, and not to a broad range of matters that may be of interest to Canada, as argued by the Minister.\n[94] Division 4 of IRPA makes permanent residents and foreign nationals inadmissible to Canada for a variety of reasons. These include violating human or international rights (section 35), serious criminality (section 36), organized criminality (section 37) and misrepresentation (section 40).\n[95] As noted earlier, the heading for section 34 states that the section relates to inadmissibility for \u201cSecurity\u201d reasons [my emphasis]. This suggests that the Canadian interests at stake in paragraph 34(1)(a) are Canada\u2019s national security or security interests.\n[96] I recognize that in accordance with section 14 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-21, marginal notes and headings do not form part of a statute, and are inserted only for ease of reference. That said, it is nevertheless permissible to consider them as part of the interpretative process, although they may be accorded lesser weight than other interpretive aids: Corbett v. Canada, [1997] 1 F.C. 386 (F.C.A.), [1997] 1 C.T.C. 2 at para. 13.\n[97] The understanding that the interests at stake in paragraph 34(1)(a) are Canada\u2019s security interests is further confirmed when regard is had to the chapeau of subsection 34(1). This states that permanent residents or foreign nationals are \u201cinadmissible on security grounds\u201d [my emphasis] for various activities, including espionage and membership in organizations that engage in espionage. Once again, this suggests that Parliament intended that the Canadian interests at stake under this provision are its national security or security interests.\n[98] In addition to espionage, permanent residents or foreign nationals may be found inadmissible to Canada under subsection 34(1) for involvement in the subversion by force of any government, engaging in terrorism, being a danger to the security of Canada, or engaging in acts of violence that could endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada. Individuals may also be found to be inadmissible to Canada for being a member of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged or will engage in any of these activities.\n[99] That paragraph 34(1)(a) appears amidst other security grounds in subsection 34(1), \u201call of which have a link to national security or the security of Canada\u201d is telling: Mason, above at para. 121. This placement further constrains the reasonable interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA.\n[100] There are other provisions of IRPA that constrain the interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) that were not considered by the ID. An example is the criteria that come into play when the Minister is conducting a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA). A PRRA is a process whereby an individual subject to a removal order may apply to the Minister for protection, resulting in refugee protection or a stay of the removal order: see IRPA, subsection. 112 and 114(1).\n[101] As the Supreme Court observed at paragraph 93 of Mason, the Minister must ordinarily consider the danger that a PRRA applicant would be subjected to torture, the risk to their life, and a risk they would be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in a PRRA application.\n[102] However, the PRRA process for persons found inadmissible on security grounds under subsection 34(1) of IRPA does not permit consideration of whether they meet the criteria for protection under the Refugee Convention. The Minister does, however, have to consider \u201cwhether the application should be refused because of the nature and severity of acts committed by the applicant or because of the danger that the applicant constitutes to the security of Canada\u201d [my emphasis]: IRPA, s. 113(d)(ii).\n[103] This distinction supports the position that the security grounds under subsection 34(1) of IRPA require a nexus to national security or the security of Canada.\n[104] None of these interpretive tools were considered by the ID in finding that \u201cCanada\u2019s interests\u201d should be given a broad interpretation\u2014one that does not require a nexus to Canada\u2019s national security or its security interests. While, as noted above, administrative decision makers need not always engage in statutory interpretation as would a Court, their interpretation of statutory provisions must be consistent with the modern principle of statutory interpretation, which focuses on the text, context, and purpose of the provision in question. That is, administrative decision makers must demonstrate in their reasons that they were alive to these elements: Mason, above at para. 69; Vavilov, above at paras. 119-120. The ID\u2019s failure to do so here indicates that its interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) lacked the degree of justification required of a reasonable decision.\n[105] Interpreting the phrase \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d in paragraph 34(1)(a) as requiring a nexus to Canada\u2019s national security or security interests also accords with the purpose of the provision.\n[106] The current version of paragraph 34(1)(a) came into force on June 19, 2013: Faster Removal of Foreign Criminals Act, S.C. 2013, c. 16, s. 13 (Bill C-43). Prior to 2013, paragraph 34(1)(a) stated that permanent residents or foreign nationals were inadmissible on security grounds for \u201cengaging in an act of espionage or an act of subversion against a democratic government, institution or process as they are understood in Canada\u201d.\n[107] As a result of the 2013 amendments, engaging in acts of espionage and engaging in acts of subversion became two distinct grounds of inadmissibility, with acts of subversion being dealt with under paragraphs 34(1)(b) and (b.1) of IRPA. Whereas both espionage and subversion previously had to be directed against \u201ca democratic government, institution or process as they are understood in Canada\u201d, the two types of activity are now constrained by different requirements: Weldemariam FC, above at para. 46.\n[108] Acts of espionage must now be directed against Canada or be contrary to Canada\u2019s interests, whereas one can be inadmissible for acts of subversion if they are directed against \u201cany government\u201d or \u201ca democratic government, institution or process as they are understood in Canada\u201d.\n[109] Comparing the text of the current provisions with those they replaced demonstrates that the scope of the term \u201cespionage\u201d as a ground of inadmissibility was narrowed in 2013. Whereas it was sufficient under the prior legislation that the act of espionage be directed against \u201ca democratic government, institution or process as they are understood in Canada\u201d, acts of espionage must now be directed against Canada or be \u201ccontrary to Canada's interests\u201d to render an individual inadmissible to Canada.\n[110] In finding that the purpose of the 2013 amendments to section 34 of IRPA was to narrow the application of the provision relating to espionage, the Federal Court had regard to comments made by the then-Minister of Citizenship, Immigration, and Multiculturalism. That is, when Bill C-43 received First Reading, the Honourable Jason Kenney explained the rationale for the change in the wording of the provision relating to espionage as being \u201cto narrow the breadth of the inadmissibility provision for espionage to focus on activities carried out against Canada or that are contrary to the interests of Canada\u201d [my emphasis].\n[111] Minister Kenney observed that the language of the prior version of paragraph 34(1)(a) was \u201cunnecessarily broad\u201d, and could potentially catch \u201cthose who may have been involved in espionage for close democratic allies of Canada and who may in fact have been gathering intelligence on behalf of Canada against common security threats\u201d. According to the Minister, it was therefore preferable to \u201cfocus the inadmissibility provision with respect to espionage on those who have been engaged in spying contrary to the interests of Canada\u201d: Weldemariam FC, above at para. 47, citing Canada, Parliament, House of Commons Debates, 41st Parl., 1st Sess., Vol. 146, No. 151 (24 September 2012), at page 10327.\n[112] Agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA) in the United States and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in the United Kingdom gather intelligence on behalf of Canada against common security threats. Such activities could be construed as acts of espionage \u201cagainst a democratic government, institution or process as they are understood in Canada\u201d, and could thus be caught by the previous version of paragraph 34(1)(a). Consequently, paragraph 34(1)(a) was narrowed in 2013 to avoid the risk of agents of friendly security agencies being deemed inadmissible for espionage activities that may nevertheless be in Canada\u2019s interests.\n[113] As the Federal Court observed, the ID\u2019s broad understanding of the scope of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA could potentially capture those working for friendly security agencies such as the NSA or GCHQ. Such individuals could, for example, engage in espionage in a manner that is contrary to Canada\u2019s interests in matters such as adherence to Charter values, but that would not be contrary to Canada\u2019s national security or security interests. The ID never considered whether its expansive interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) was consistent with Parliament\u2019s intention to narrow the scope of this ground of inadmissibility: Weldemariam FC, above at para. 50.\n[114] The failure on the part of the ID to consider these additional principles of statutory interpretation provides further reasons for a loss of confidence in the ID\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA.\nVIII. Is There More than One Reasonable Interpretation of Paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA? [115] As the Supreme Court observed in Mason, \u201ca court may conclude during a reasonableness review that \u2018the interplay of text, context and purpose leaves room for a single reasonable interpretation of the statutory provision, or aspect of the statutory provision\u2019\u201d: above at para. 71, see also para. 120; Vavilov, at para. 124.\n[116] In my view, this is such a case.\n[117] I acknowledge that, as argued by the Minister, there are some interpretive constraints that would support the ID\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA. There are, however, critical legal constraints and principles of statutory interpretation that the ID failed to consider that lead to the opposite interpretation. These include the constraints imposed on the ID by international law, and by principles of statutory interpretation. These overwhelmingly support the conclusion that there is only one reasonable interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a).\n[118] That is, permanent residents or foreign nationals may only be found to be inadmissible to Canada under paragraphs 34(1)(a) and 34(1)(f) of IRPA where the espionage in which they are involved\u2014either directly or indirectly\u2014is directed against Canada or has a nexus to Canada\u2019s national security or security interests: Mason at para. 121.\n[119] Given that there is only one reasonable interpretation of the disputed portion of paragraph 34(1)(a), it follows that the decision of the ID was unreasonable, and that it should be quashed.\n[120] The next question is whether Mr. Weldemariam\u2019s case should be remitted to the ID for redetermination.\nIX. Should Mr. Weldemariam\u2019s Case be Remitted to the ID for Redetermination? [121] The Supreme Court observed in Mason that where the reviewing Court concludes that there is only one reasonable interpretation of a legislative provision, the Court may conclude that remitting the question to the administrative decision maker for redetermination would serve no useful purpose: Mason, above at paras. 71, 120; Vavilov, above at para. 124.\n[122] INSA\u2019s espionage activities took place outside Canada, and they did not involve Canada in any way. Indeed, the only nexus that the ID found to Canada\u2019s interests was that INSA had \u201cengaged in espionage against nationals of countries allied to Canada\u201d.\n[123] There was in fact no definitive evidence before the ID that the journalists and political dissidents targeted by INSA were nationals of either the United States or Belgium. Even if they were, INSA was not targeting the United States or Belgium\u2014something that could potentially be understood to engage Canada\u2019s national security. INSA was targeting private individuals who were living in these countries.\n[124] As the Federal Court observed, it is quite a different thing \u201cto suggest that Canada\u2019s national security interests are engaged simply by the targeting of individuals who are nationals or residents of one of its allies, as opposed to the targeting of the ally itself\u201d: Weldemariam FC, above at para. 74.\n[125] The Federal Court further noted that \u201c[at] the very least, a reasonable explanation of the nexus between this and Canada\u2019s national security interests must be provided for the decision to withstand review\u201d: Weldemariam FC, above at para. 74. No such explanation was provided in this case.\n[126] While ESAT is active in Canada, there was no suggestion that any of the targeted ESAT journalists live in this country. The evidence before the ID also did not suggest that INSA\u2019s acts were targeted at Canada as a state, at Canadian companies, at Canadian institutions or at Canadian individuals, including members of the Ethiopian diaspora. Nor was there evidence that INSA\u2019s acts involved Canada\u2019s national security or security interests in any way. They were thus beyond the purview of \u201cCanada\u2019s interests\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA.\n[127] Nor was it established that Mr. Weldemariam was a member of an organization that was engaged in acts of espionage directed against Canada, or that had a link to Canada\u2019s national security or the security of Canada. Consequently, paragraphs 34(1)(a) and 34(1)(f) of IRPA do not provide a legal basis for a finding that Mr. Weldemariam is inadmissible to Canada. Given that the Minister has not alleged any other basis for Mr. Weldemariam\u2019s inadmissibility, there is no need to remit this case to the ID for redetermination.\nX. Conclusion [128] For these reasons, I find that the Federal Court did not err in finding that the ID\u2019s decision was unreasonable. I would answer the question certified by the Federal Court in the negative, and would dismiss the Minister\u2019s appeal.\n\u201cAnne L. Mactavish\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nJ.B.

The Appeal Division, affirming a decision by the General Division delivered on November 7, 2022, held that the applicant was disqualified from receiving employment insurance benefits when he lost his job due to misconduct. He had failed to comply with his employer\u2019s COVID vaccination policy.\n[3] The applicant argued before both Divisions that he did not engage in misconduct on the job. Among other things, he focused on the validity of the employer\u2019s vaccination policy.\n[4] The Appeal Division rejected the applicant\u2019s argument. Following applicable court jurisprudence (e.g., Canada (Attorney General) v. McNamara, 2007 FCA 107 at paras. 22-23, Paradis v. Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 1282 at paras. 30-31 and Cecchetto v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 102), the Appeal Division held that the test for misconduct focuses on the employee\u2019s knowledge and actions, not on the employer\u2019s behaviour or the reasonableness of its work policies. It added that the applicant could pursue remedies elsewhere if he considered that his employer treated him improperly.\n[5] In our view, the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is reasonable. It is supported by the evidentiary record before it and applicable court jurisprudence.\n[6] We would add that the court jurisprudence makes sense. Were the applicant\u2019s submissions to be upheld, the Social Security Tribunal would become a forum to question employer policies and the validity of employment dismissals. Under any plausible reading of the legislation that governs the Tribunal, it is a forum to determine entitlement to social security benefits, not a forum to adjudicate allegations of wrongful dismissal. We note that the applicant in fact has pursued remedies elsewhere for wrongful dismissal and has made a human rights complaint.\n[7] Before both Divisions of the Social Security Tribunal, the applicant raised the Canadian Bill of Rights, S.C. 1960, c. 44. He raises it again here to suggest that his \u201cmisconduct\u201d did not legally constitute misconduct. Here again, as explained above, this submission is legally irrelevant to the Social Security Tribunal\u2019s task. Under its governing statute, the Social Security Tribunal cannot assess whether the applicant\u2019s dismissal from employment was wrongful.\n[8] In this Court, the applicant has raised the Charter in support of his claim. In the General Division, he raised Charter arguments but expressly withdrew them. Thus, his Charter arguments in this Court are a new, inadmissible issue: Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. Alberta Teachers\u2019 Association, 2011 SCC 61, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 654. We add that all Charter arguments, whether based on rights, freedoms or values must be supported by a rich evidentiary record, not by the \u201cunsupported hypotheses of enthusiastic counsel\u201d or judges: see the venerable, unquestioned case of Mackay v. Manitoba, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357, 61 D.L.R. (4th) 385 at 362. We do not have that sort of evidentiary record here.\n[9] Just a couple of weeks before the appeal hearing, the Supreme Court released its decision in Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest v. Northwest Territories (Education, Culture and Employment), 2023 SCC 31. In that decision, the Supreme Court held that decision-makers, at least in some circumstances, must take into account values resident in the Charter and that reviewing courts can consider them even where administrators have not considered them. Out of fairness to the applicant, we invited him to make submissions on whether the Tribunal should have taken into account any Charter values in this case.\n[10] The applicant submits that Charter values of \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d, as broad and unqualified as they are, should have been considered. He submits that the Appeal Division should have used \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d to whittle down or eradicate the vaccination requirements that were enforced against him. We reject this submission.\n[11] The text of the Charter and case law under it heavily qualifies \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d. And everything in the Charter is subject to reasonable limits prescribed by law under section 1. As well, it must also be remembered that section 1 of the Charter, in binding words that cannot be ignored, says that the Charter protects the \u201crights and freedoms set out in it\u201d, not other things such as \u201cvalues\u201d. Thus, the \u201cvalues\u201d that administrative decision-makers are to take into account cannot be broader than, undercut or do an end run around the established scope of the \u201crights and freedoms set out\u201d in the Charter determined in accordance with the seminal, binding Supreme Court authority of Quebec (Attorney General) v. 9147-0732 Qu\u00e9bec Inc., 2020 SCC 32, [2020] 3 S.C.R. 426. Undercutting the applicant\u2019s submission is the fact that there are no Charter cases recognizing a general, unqualified entitlement to \u201cfreedom\u201d or \u201cequality\u201d.\n[12] It is worth adding that under Commission scolaire, Charter values cannot be used to invalidate legislative provisions that administrative decision-makers must follow, such as, in this case, section 30 of the Employment Insurance Act. Only unjustified violations of rights and freedoms can strike down legislation. Here, as we have said, the Social Security Tribunal was reasonable in holding that the applicant was precluded under that section and related court jurisprudence from questioning the appropriateness of the termination of his employment.\n[13] The applicant also submits that he has been treated in a procedurally unfair manner. He focuses on the Social Security Tribunal receiving unsworn testimony. The Appeal Division answered this at paras. 15-16 of its decision, holding that it does have the power to receive unsworn testimony. We agree with this conclusion and the reasons offered by the Appeal Division.\n[14] The applicant is certain that he was wrongly dismissed. We sympathize with his plight but as a court of law we are bound to apply the law. As mentioned above, the law is that the Social Security Tribunal cannot delve into whether the dismissal was proper or the reasonableness of the employer\u2019s work policies that led to the dismissal.\n[15] We thank the applicant for the skill, organizational ability and eloquence he displayed in making his submissions.\n[16] Therefore, we will dismiss the application with costs.\n\u201cDavid Stratas\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-139-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nSKY SULLIVAN v.

MONAGHAN J.A.\nDate: 20240412\nDocket: A-222-20\nCitation: 2024 FCA 70\nCORAM:\nLASKIN J.A.\nMACTAVISH J.A.\nMONAGHAN J.A.\nBETWEEN:\nTHE MINISTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS\nAppellant\nand\nABEL NAHUSENAY YIHDEGO\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nMACTAVISH J.A.\n[1] Abel Nahusenay Yihdego was found to be inadmissible to Canada pursuant to paragraphs 34(1)(a) and (f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA) for being a member of an organization for which there are reasonable grounds to believe had engaged in espionage. These provisions make permanent residents and foreign nationals inadmissible to Canada on security grounds if they are members of an organization for which there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged or will engage in espionage \u201cagainst Canada or that is contrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d.\n[2] Mr. Yihdego does not now dispute that he was a member of an organization that has engaged in espionage. The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness does not allege that the espionage carried out by the organization in question was \u201cagainst Canada\u201d. The sole issue on this appeal is thus whether the Immigration Division (ID) of the Immigration and Refugee Board reasonably found that the espionage in issue was \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA. The ID based its finding on an interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) that did not require the espionage in issue to have a nexus to Canada\u2019s national security or security interests.\n[3] In a decision reported as 2020 FC 833, the Federal Court concluded that the ID\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) was unreasonable, and that the phrase \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d requires a nexus to Canada\u2019s security interests. Consequently, the Federal Court quashed the ID\u2019s decision and remitted Mr. Yihdego\u2019s case to the ID for redetermination.\n[4] In rendering judgment allowing Mr. Yihdego\u2019s application for judicial review, the Court certified the following question:\nIs a person inadmissible to Canada pursuant to paragraph 34(1)(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act for being a member of an organization with respect to which there are reasonable grounds to believe it has engaged in, engages in, or will engage in acts of espionage that are \u201ccontrary to Canada's interests\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 34(1)(a) of the Act if the organization\u2019s espionage activities take place outside Canada and target foreign nationals in a manner that is contrary to the values that underlie the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the democratic character of Canada, including the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by paragraph 2(b) of the Charter?\n[5] For the reasons that follow, I find that the Federal Court did not err in finding that the ID\u2019s decision was unreasonable, and in concluding that the phrase \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d requires a nexus to Canada\u2019s national security or security interests. I am satisfied that the ID failed to have regard to legal constraints imposed on it by international law, in particular the non\u2011refoulement provisions of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, Can. T.S. 1969 No. 6 (Refugee Convention), as well as recognized principles of statutory interpretation.\n[6] Consequently, I would answer the certified question in the negative, and would dismiss the appeal.\nI. Background [7] Mr. Yihdego is an Ethiopian citizen and a former employee of the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), an Ethiopian state security and intelligence agency, where he was employed as a protocol analyst and network engineer in the years between 2011 and 2014. Mr. Yihdego claims that in the course of employment he was pressured to join INSA\u2019s decryption unit and that his superiors threatened and harassed him when he refused to do so.\n[8] In an effort to avoid further pressure from his superiors, Mr. Yihdego resigned from INSA in 2014, enrolling in graduate studies outside of Ethiopia. On his return to Ethiopia in 2017, Mr. Yihdego claims that he was detained by security services because of his political opinions and his membership in a political party. Fearing further mistreatment, Mr. Yihdego fled to Canada, entering this country on a temporary resident visa. A few months later, he sought refugee protection in Canada.\n[9] Mr. Yihdego\u2019s refugee claim was held in abeyance while the Minister inquired into his admissibility to Canada in light of his employment with INSA. The ID then held a hearing with respect to Mr. Yihdego\u2019s admissibility.\nII. The Immigration Division\u2019s Decision [10] The Minister did not allege that Mr. Yihdego was himself engaged in espionage. In a decision reported as X (Re), 2019 CanLII 132626, the ID nevertheless found that, by virtue of his employment with INSA, Mr. Yihdego was a \u201cmember\u201d of that \u201corganization\u201d. The ID further found that INSA was an organization that had engaged in cyber espionage, using spyware to target members of the Ethiopian diaspora, as well as a private sector entity known as the Ethiopian Satellite Television (ESAT), in the United States. ESAT is an independent satellite, radio, television and online news outlet run by members of the Ethiopian diaspora in a number of countries, including the United States and Canada.\n[11] None of these findings are in dispute in this appeal.\n[12] What is in dispute is the ID\u2019s finding that the espionage carried out by INSA was \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d, as that phrase is used in paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA.\n[13] In finding that INSA\u2019s espionage activities were \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d, the ID noted that its \u201cactivities were directed against Canadian allies\u201d, and that they were \u201cunacceptably dismissive of the values underlying the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\u201d. The ID further found that INSA\u2019s espionage activities \u201cundermined the democratic character of Canada the Canadian federation and the protection of rights conferred\u201d: all quotes from para. 120. These findings are the central focus of this appeal.\n[14] Based upon this understanding of what could be \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d, the ID concluded that Mr. Yihdego was inadmissible to Canada pursuant to paragraphs 34(1)(a) and (f) of IRPA for being a member of an organization for which there are reasonable grounds to believe had engaged in espionage.\nIII. The Federal Court\u2019s Decision [15] The primary focus of Mr. Yihdego\u2019s challenge to the ID\u2019s decision was its finding that INSA\u2019s espionage activities were \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d.\n[16] In allowing Mr. Yihdego\u2019s application for judicial review, the Federal Court adopted the reasoning of the Federal Court in Weldemariam v. Canada (MPSEP), 2020 FC 631 (Weldemariam FC). There, the Federal Court found that the ID\u2019s inadmissibility finding rested on an unreasonably broad interpretation of the phrase \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d, as it appears in paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA. The Federal Court further found in Weldemariam FC that, reasonably interpreted, the phrase \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d in paragraph 34(1)(a) required a nexus between the espionage actions in issue and Canada\u2019s national security.\n[17] In Mr. Yihdego\u2019s case, the Federal Court found that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11, does not apply to INSA or to the targeted journalists, all of whom were outside of Canada. While INSA may have acted in a manner that was contrary to Canadian values, that is not the same thing as imperiling Canada\u2019s national security. The Federal Court concluded that the ID\u2019s finding that INSA engaged in espionage against an important Canadian ally was unreasonable, as no evidence had been adduced to show that either the United States or its citizens were targets. Moreover, even if American citizens had been targeted by INSA, the ID did not explain how this engaged Canada\u2019s national security interests.\nIV. The Issue [18] As noted earlier, the sole issue before this Court is whether the ID\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA was reasonable, and whether a nexus to Canada\u2019s national security or security interests is required with respect to \u201cCanada\u2019s interests\u201d, in order to bring an act of espionage within the scope of paragraph 34(1)(a).\nV. The Standard of Review [19] This Court\u2019s role in an appeal such as this is to determine whether the Federal Court identified the correct standard of review\u2014correctness or reasonableness\u2014and whether it properly applied that standard: Northern Regional Health Authority v. Horrocks, 2021 SCC 42 at paras. 10-12; Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36 at paras. 45-47. This has been described as requiring us to \u201cstep into the shoes\u201d of the Federal Court judge, focusing on the administrative decision below.\n[20] This Court has previously expressed concerns with respect to the application of the reasonableness standard in the context of questions certified by the Federal Court under the provisions of subsection 74(d) of IRPA. This is especially so where, as here, this Court is called upon to answer questions of statutory interpretation that may require a yes or no answer: see e.g. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Galindo Camayo, 2022 FCA 50 at paras. 40\u201144. See also the dissenting opinion of Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 in Mason v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 21 at paras. 126, 152. Nevertheless, the majority decision in Mason affirms that reasonableness is the standard to be applied by reviewing courts in addressing certified questions in the immigration context.\n[21] Consequently, I agree with the parties that the Federal Court correctly identified reasonableness as the standard to be applied in reviewing the ID\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA, specifically the phrase \u201ccontrary to Canada\u2019s interests\u201d as it appears in that provision. The question for determination is thus whether the Federal Court properly applied the reasonableness standard in this case.\nVI. Analysis [22] The question certified by the Federal Court in Mr. Yihdego\u2019s case is the same question that was certified by the Federal Court in Weldemariam FC. The Minister\u2019s appeals from the two decisions were heard together, and the arguments advanced by the parties in each case were largely the same.\n[23] This Court provided a detailed analysis of the international law and other statutory interpretation issues relating to the interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA in its decision related to Mr. Weldemariam\u2019s appeal, which was released contemporaneously with this one (Canada (MPSEP) v. Weldemariam, 2024 FCA 69 (Weldemariam FCA)). That analysis is equally applicable to Mr. Yihdego\u2019s appeal.\n[24] Thus, for the reasons given by this Court in Weldemariam FCA, I have concluded that there is only one reasonable interpretation of the disputed portion of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA. That is, permanent residents or foreign nationals may only be found to be inadmissible to Canada under paragraphs 34(1)(a) and 34(1)(f) of IRPA where the espionage in which they are involved\u2014either directly or indirectly\u2014is directed against Canada, or has a nexus to Canada\u2019s national security or security interests. It follows that the decision of the ID was unreasonable, and that the Federal Court did not err in setting that decision aside.\n[25] The next question is whether Mr. Yihdego\u2019s case should be remitted to the ID for redetermination.\n[26] As was the situation in Mr. Weldemariam\u2019s case, there was no suggestion that any of the targeted ESAT journalists lived in Canada. The evidence before the ID also did not suggest that INSA\u2019s acts were directed at Canada as a state, at Canadian companies, at Canadian institutions or at Canadian individuals, including members of the Ethiopian diaspora. Nor was there evidence that INSA\u2019s acts implicated Canada\u2019s national security or security interests in any way. They were thus beyond the purview of \u201cCanada\u2019s interests\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 34(1)(a) of IRPA.\n[27] Nor was it established that Mr. Yihdego was a member of an organization that was engaged in acts of espionage directed against Canada, or that had a link to Canada\u2019s national security or the security of Canada. Consequently, paragraphs 34(1)(a) and 34(1)(f) of IRPA do not provide a legal basis for a finding that Mr. Yihdego is inadmissible to Canada. Given that the Minister has not alleged any other basis for Mr. Yihdego\u2019s inadmissibility, there is no need to remit this case to the ID for redetermination.\nVII. Conclusion [28] For these reasons, I am satisfied that the Federal Court did not err in finding that the ID\u2019s decision was unreasonable. I would answer the question certified by the Federal Court in the negative, and would dismiss the Minister\u2019s appeal.\n\u201cAnne L. Mactavish\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nJ.B.

Background [1] This is an appeal of a decision by the Federal Court (2022 FC 1398, per Justice Martine St-Louis) that found various claims of Canadian Patent No. 2,226,784 (the 784 Patent) to be invalid for overbreadth and insufficiency. As a result, the Federal Court dismissed actions by the appellants against the respondents alleging infringement of the 784 Patent. The respondents had also argued that the claims in issue were invalid for inutility, but the Federal Court elected not to decide that issue.\n[2] The present appeal turns principally on the Federal Court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d in reference to a physiologically acceptable salt of tadalafil, which is an element of all of the claims in issue. Stated briefly, the appellants argue that \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d simply means non-toxic, such that any salt of tadalafil that is not toxic when administered is physiologically acceptable. For their part, the respondents argue that the Federal Court\u2019s interpretation was correct \u2013 that a salt that is \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d must be more than merely non-toxic, it must also be \u201cstable and pure, not degraded\u201d (see paragraph 92 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons (the Reasons)).\n[3] The appellants argue that if the Federal Court had not erred in its interpretation of \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d, it would not have concluded that the claims in issue are invalid for overbreadth and insufficiency.\n[4] The respondents argue that, even on the appellants\u2019 interpretation of \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d, the claims in issue would be invalid for overbreadth and insufficiency. They also argue that, based on its factual findings, the Federal Court should also have found the claims in issue to be invalid for inutility.\n[5] For the reasons discussed below, I would dismiss the appeal.\nII. The 784 Patent [6] The 784 Patent concerns the use of tadalafil (among other compounds) and its physiologically acceptable salts in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The appellants market the alleged invention of the 784 Patent with their drug CIALIS.\n[7] The 784 Patent expired in 2016 and the respondents did not enter the market with their generic versions of CIALIS until after that. However, the appellants allege that the respondents engaged in activities prior to expiration, including manufacturing, importing and stockpiling, that constituted infringement of the claims in issue.\n[8] The key term \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d is not defined in the 784 Patent. It is notable that the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d [emphasis added] is used many times in the disclosure and claims of the 784 Patent. In many such instances, this term is used to describe a salt as contemplated by the invention. As explained below, the parallel use of \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d and \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d to describe the salts contemplated by the invention led the Federal Court to conclude that these terms are synonymous in the context of the 784 Patent.\n[9] Page 4 of the 784 Patent specification provides examples of the salts contemplated therein specific to tadalafil:\nThe pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I), and in particular compounds A [tadalafil] and B which contain a basic centre are acid addition salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable acids. Examples include the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate or bisulphate, phosphate or hydrogen phosphate, acetate, benzoate, succinate, fumarate, maleate, lactate, citrate, tartrate, gluconate, methanesulphonate, benzenesulphonate and p-toluenesulphonate salts. Compounds of formula (I), and in particular compounds A and B can also provide pharmaceutically acceptable metal salts, in particular alkali metal salts, with bases. Examples include the sodium and potassium salts.\n[10] The 784 Patent also describes pharmaceutically acceptable salts and how to make them at page 9:\nThe pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of a compound of formula (I), and in particular compound A [tadalafil] or B which contain a basic centre may be prepared in a conventional manner. For example, a solution of the free base may be treated with a suitable acid, either neat or in a suitable solution, and the resulting salt isolated either by filtration or by evaporation under vacuum of the reaction solvent. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts may be obtained in an analogous manner by treating a solution of compound A or B with a suitable base. Both types of salt may be formed or interconverted using ion-exchange resin techniques.\n[11] The term \u201cnon-toxic\u201d is used only once in the 784 Patent (at page 5, line 28) to describe the type of salt that is contemplated by the invention. Interestingly, the relevant passage in the disclosure is specific to veterinary use: \u201cFor veterinary use, a compound of formula (I), and in particular compound A [tadalafil] or B or a non-toxic salt thereof is administered as a suitably acceptable formulation in accordance with normal veterinary practice \u2026\u201d. A corresponding paragraph describing use of the invention in humans does not mention salts and does not use the term \u201cnon-toxic\u201d.\n[12] The dispute over the validity of the 784 Patent relates to evidence that any salts of tadalafil that could be made at the filing date of the 784 Patent were unstable and would quickly degrade. The respondents argue that any such salts were not \u201cstable and pure, not degraded\u201d, and hence not physiologically acceptable. It follows from this, the respondents argue, that the claims in issue are invalid for overbreadth (because they encompass something that the inventor did not invent) and insufficiency (because they do not explain to a person of skill in the art (POSITA) how to make physiologically acceptable salts of tadalafil).\n[13] The appellants counter that the disclosure of the 784 Patent clearly identifies salts that it contemplates, and though it calls for them to be \u201cnon-toxic\u201d, it does not require that they have any particular degree of stability or purity. The appellants continue their argument by noting that, if the \u201cstable and pure, not degraded\u201d requirement is excluded from the definition of \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d, and only non-toxicity is required, then there is no basis to find that the claims in issue are either overbroad or insufficiently described.\nIII. The Federal Court\u2019s Decision [14] After describing the 784 Patent, the Federal Court outlined the evidence before it. This included the expert evidence of Dr. Andr\u00e9 Beauchemin on behalf of the respondents (there, the defendants), and Drs. Philip G. Jessop and Stephen Byrn on behalf of the appellants (there, the plaintiffs). All experts addressed the meaning of \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d. The Federal Court was impressed with the evidence of Dr. Beauchemin and gave his opinion \u201cgreat weight\u201d (see paragraph 41 of the Reasons). The Federal Court found that Dr. Jessop was a reliable witness, but did not accept his interpretation of \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d because some of his testimony went outside his area of expertise.\n[15] As for Dr. Byrn, the Federal Court expressed \u201cvery strong reservations\u201d relying on his testimony because of his manner of responding to questions, contradictions in his testimony and his characterization of evidence he had provided previously (see paragraph 66 of the Reasons). The Federal Court was unwilling to accept Dr. Byrn\u2019s testimony as fair, non-partisan and objective, and gave it \u201cvery little weight\u201d (see paragraph 68 of the Reasons).\n[16] The Federal Court then turned to defining the POSITA from whose point of view the 784 Patent should be read (about which there is no dispute) and construing terms used in the claims in issue. It cited this Court\u2019s decision in Tearlab Corporation v. I-MED Pharma Inc., 2019 FCA 179, 166 C.P.R. (4th) 367, paragraphs 30 to 34 of which provide a useful summary of principles of claim construction:\n[30] The general principles of claim construction are now well established and were set out by the Supreme Court in three cases (Whirlpool [Corp. v. Camco Inc., 2000 SCC 67, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1067] at paras. 49-55; Free World Trust v. \u00c9lectro Sant\u00e9 Inc., 2000 SCC 66, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1024 at paras. 31-67 [Free World Trust]; Consolboard Inc. v. MacMillan Bloedel (Sask.) Ltd., [1981] 1 S.C.R. 504 at p. 520 [Consolboard]). These principles can be summarized as follows.\n[31] The Patent Act promotes adherence to the language of the claims, which in turn promotes fairness and predictability (Free World Trust at paras. 31(a), (b) and 41). The words of the claims must, however, be read in an informed and purposive way (at para. 31(c)), with a mind willing to understand (at para. 44). On a purposive construction, it will be apparent that some elements of the claimed invention are essential while others are non-essential (at para. 31(e)). The interpretative task of the court, in claim construction, is to separate and distinguish between the essential and the non-essential elements, and to give the legal protection to which the holder of a valid patent is entitled only to the essential elements (at para. 15).\n[32] To identify these elements, the claim language must be read through the eyes of a POSITA, in light of the latter\u2019s common general knowledge (Free World Trust at paras. 44-45; see also [AFD Petroleum Ltd. v.] Frac Shack [Inc., 2018 FCA 140, 157 C.P.R. (4th) 195] at para. 60; Whirlpool at para. 53). As noted in Free World Trust:\n[51] \u2026The words chosen by the inventor will be read in the sense the inventor is presumed to have intended, and in a way that is sympathetic to accomplishment of the inventor\u2019s purpose expressed or implicit in the text of the claims. However, if the inventor has misspoken or otherwise created an unnecessary or troublesome limitation in the claims, it is a self-inflicted wound. The public is entitled to rely on the words used provided the words used are interpreted fairly and knowledgeably. [Emphasis in the original.]\n[33] Claim construction requires that the disclosure and the claims be looked at as a whole \u201cto ascertain the nature of the invention and methods of its performance, \u2026 being neither benevolent nor harsh, but rather seeking a construction which is reasonable and fair to both patentee and public\u201d (Consolboard at p. 520; see also Teva Canada Ltd. v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2012 SCC 60, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 625 at para. 50). Consideration can thus be given to the patent specifications to understand what was meant by the words in the claims. One must be wary, however, not to use these so as \u201cto enlarge or contract the scope of the claim as written and \u2026 understood\u201d (Whirlpool at para. 52; see also Free World Trust at para. 32). The Supreme Court recently emphasized that the focus of the validity analysis will be on the claims; specifications will be relevant where there is ambiguity in the claims (AstraZeneca Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2017 SCC 36, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 943 at para. 31; see also Ciba [Specialty Chemicals Water Treatments Limited\u2019s v. SNF Inc., 2017 FCA 225, 152 C.P.R. (4th) 239] at paras. 74-75).\n[34] Finally, it is important to stress that claim construction must be the same for the purpose of validity and for the purpose of infringement (Whirlpool at para. 49(b)).\n[17] The Federal Court also noted that (i) claim construction is a matter of law, (ii) the expert\u2019s role is not to interpret the claims, but rather to put the judge in a position to do so, and (iii) claims are to be construed through the eyes of the POSITA armed with the common general knowledge at the date of publication.\n[18] Next, the Federal Court construed the term \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d. After noting that it is not defined in the 784 Patent, the Federal Court accepted the experts\u2019 view that the terms \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d and \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d are synonymous in the context of the 784 Patent (see paragraph 83 of the Reasons). There is no dispute on this point.\n[19] The Federal Court acknowledged at paragraph 84 of the Reasons that Dr. Beauchemin \u201cdid not specifically dedicate a section of his affidavit to construe the term physiologically or pharmaceutically, nor [was he] instructed to do so.\u201d The Federal Court also accepted at paragraph 88 that the POSITA \u201cwould have understood that a physiologically acceptable salt was certainly a non-toxic one.\u201d However, the Federal Court did not accept that non-toxicity was all that was required, stating as follows: \u201cThis is too low a threshold; surely, pharmaceutically acceptable products are held to a higher standard.\u201d At paragraphs 89 and 90 of the Reasons, the Federal Court continued:\n[89] The disclosure of the 784 Patent itself provides an indicia that non-toxic does not correspond to pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable. The patentee does use the term \u201cnon-toxic\u201d at page 5 of the disclosure in the context of veterinary use, but nowhere else. There is here no indication that the patentee considered the word non-toxic to be a synonym of the term physiologically acceptable, as it was the case between physiologically and pharmaceutically. The patentee knows the term non-toxic but has used it only in relation with a salt destined to veterinary use. We can thus infer that the patentee, had he intended to limit the meaning of physiologically or pharmaceutically acceptable to non-toxic, would have signaled so.\n[90] In addition, the amalgamated use of the terms physiologically with pharmaceutically acceptable obviously elevates the threshold beyond what is merely not toxic or not harmful for the body. I can easily follow Dr. Beauchemin\u2019s guidance and conclude that a physiologically or pharmaceutically acceptable salt also must be stable and pure, not degraded.\n[20] The Federal Court\u2019s conclusion concerning the meaning of \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d appears to have been based on at least paragraphs 49 and 79 of Dr. Beauchemin\u2019s affidavit sworn September 17, 2020 (Dr. Beauchemin\u2019s First Affidavit), as well as paragraph 27 of Dr. Beauchemin\u2019s affidavit sworn April 15, 2021.\n[21] The foregoing analysis led to the following conclusion at paragraph 92 of the Reasons:\n[92] I thus find that POSITA, armed with the common general knowledge of 1997, would have understood a \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d salt certainly required the salt be non-toxic and to not cause harm. However, I find the POSITA would also have understood that the salt needed to be stable and pure, not degraded.\n[22] The Federal Court went on to construe the term \u201csalt\u201d, but nothing turns on that construction.\n[23] Having completed its claim construction, the Federal Court then considered the respondents\u2019 allegations of invalidity of the claims in issue of the 784 Patent: overbreadth, insufficiency and inutility. As indicated above, it concluded that the claims in issue were invalid for overbreadth and for insufficiency, and it elected not to decide the issue of inutility.\n[24] To find that the claims in issue were invalid for overbreadth, the Federal Court relied on (i) its conclusion that a physiologically acceptable salt as contemplated therein would have to be stable and pure, not degraded, and (ii) the testimony of Dr. Beauchemin that any salts made by the POSITA as contemplated in the 784 Patent would not be pure and stable. The Federal Court found it \u201cmore probable than not that a physiologically acceptable salt of tadalafil cannot be made\u201d (see paragraph 118 of the Reasons). From this, the Federal Court concluded that no salt as claimed was invented.\n[25] To reach its conclusion of invalidity for insufficiency, the Federal Court relied again on its construction of the term \u201cphysiologically acceptable salt\u201d and evidence that such a salt could not be made by the POSITA. It found that \u201cthe disclosure will be insufficient if the POSITA can only find the invention after they have conducted a minor research project\u201d (see paragraph 144 of the Reasons). The 784 Patent indicates that the physiologically acceptable salts contemplated therein \u201cmay be prepared in a conventional manner\u201d, and gives no guidance on making them. The Federal Court concluded that the POSITA would indeed have to complete a research project to make the claimed salt.\nIV. Issues [26] As indicated at paragraphs 3 and 4 above:\nThe appellants argue that the Federal Court erred on its interpretation of the term \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d, and that this error resulted in erroneous findings of invalidity of the claims in issue for insufficiency and overbreadth; and\nThe respondents argue that the Federal Court did not err in construing the term \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d, and that even if it did err in doing so, its invalidity conclusions should stand.\nThe respondents also argue that the Federal Court should have found the claims in issue invalid for inutility.\nV. Standard of Review [27] The appellants rely heavily on an argument that the applicable standard of review on the claim construction issue in this appeal is correctness because it is a question of law.\n[28] The appellants recognize that the standard of review on an appeal is as indicated in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235: questions of law are reviewed on a standard of correctness, and questions of fact or of mixed fact and law from which no question of law is extricable are reviewed on a standard of palpable and overriding error.\n[29] The appellants also recognize that, though claim construction is a question of law (Whirlpool at paras. 61, 76), the applicable standard of review is complicated by the fact that patent claims are interpreted from the point of view of a POSITA (Whirlpool at para. 48), and expert evidence is often considered in determining how such a person would have understood certain terms in a claim at the relevant date. The weighing of expert evidence is a question of mixed fact and law. I recently discussed this point in Google LLC v. Sonos Inc., 2024 FCA 44 at para. 6.\n[30] The appellants argue that the complication due to the presence of expert evidence does not arise in this appeal because the Federal Court\u2019s conclusions regarding claim construction \u201cwere entirely the Trial Judge\u2019s own and not based on any of the expert evidence.\u201d The appellants argue that this Court therefore owes no deference to the Federal Court on its conclusions regarding claim construction.\n[31] I am unable to agree with the appellants\u2019 premise that the Federal Court\u2019s conclusions regarding claim construction were not based on expert evidence. As I explain below, I find that the Federal Court based its claim construction on expert evidence, and its conclusions in that regard are entitled to deference.\nVI. Analysis A. Claim Construction [32] As indicated above, this appeal turns principally on the Federal Court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d.\n[33] The appellants argue that the Federal Court erred in relying on Dr. Beauchemin\u2019s \u201cguidance\u201d in construing this term. They note that Dr. Beauchemin was never given instructions on how to construe patent claims, and was never asked for his opinion on the subject. Instead, he provided \u201ca functional definition\u201d of the term. The appellants argue that such a definition does not follow the purposive approach that is called for when construing patent claims, and does not meet the standard set out in the following passage from Bombardier Recreational Products Inc. v. Arctic Cat, Inc., 2018 FCA 172, 159 C.P.R. (4th) 319 at para. 24:\nThus, apart from the specification itself, the only evidence that should be considered to inform a court\u2019s analysis of a claim is proper evidence as to how the POSITA would understand it in light of his or her relevant common general knowledge in the context of the specification as a whole.\n[34] The appellants argue that (i) Dr. Beauchemin\u2019s \u201cfunctional definition\u201d of the term \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d was untethered to the 784 Patent in the sense that the patent refers to the salts in question as non-toxic, and does not even use the term \u201cstable and pure, not degraded\u201d, (ii) Dr. Beauchemin made his determination that \u201cphysiologically acceptable salts\u201d of tadalafil could not be made by the POSITA before seeing the 784 Patent, thus failing to follow the principle that claim construction is antecedent to consideration of validity issues, and (iii) while Dr. Beauchemin opined as to what a skilled person would understand by the term \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d, he did not indicate that he took into account the relevant common general knowledge. I find no merit in any of these arguments.\n[35] It is perhaps advisable to preface the comments below by noting that this appeal is to consider whether the Federal Court made a reviewable error, and not whether the respondents\u2019 expert evidence could have been better. As indicated above, the appellants argue only errors of law; they do not take issue with the Federal Court\u2019s weighing of the evidence. Accordingly, this appeal turns on whether it was open to the Federal Court to consider Dr. Beauchemin\u2019s expert testimony. In other words, did the Federal Court err by giving any weight at all to that testimony?\n[36] I disagree that Dr. Beauchemin\u2019s interpretation of \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d was untethered to the 784 Patent. The appellants rely heavily on the fact that, in his First Affidavit, Dr. Beauchemin provided his interpretation of the term before discussing the 784 Patent. While this is true, the order of presentation of his opinions does not, in my view, necessarily affect their admissibility. It was up to the Federal Court to consider the entirety of Dr. Beauchemin\u2019s testimony, including the manner in which he arrived at his opinions, and determine what weight to give to it. The Federal Court recognized that Dr. Beauchemin did not provide a formal interpretation of the term by explicitly applying the principles of claim construction, and instead he provided an opinion as to how a POSITA would understand the term. But even if that opinion was initially formed before reviewing the 784 Patent, it was clearly unchanged once he had read the patent: see paragraphs 15, 16 and 70 and following of Dr. Beauchemin\u2019s First Affidavit. It was open to the Federal Court to weigh this evidence. The Federal Court clearly understood that claim construction must precede consideration of validity issues (see paragraph 71 of the Reasons), and so it did not err in law in this respect.\n[37] The discussion in the previous paragraph applies equally to the appellants\u2019 argument that Dr. Beauchemin failed to follow the principles of claim construction. As indicated, the question is not whether Dr. Beauchemin erred in considering validity issues before construing the claims, but rather whether the Federal Court did. In my view, it did not. The real question at the root of this appeal is whether the Federal Court erred in giving any weight at all to Dr. Beauchemin\u2019s testimony. This is a question of mixed fact and law from which no question of law is extricable. The appellants do not allege any palpable and overriding error that would permit this Court to interfere with the Federal Court\u2019s decision.\n[38] The fact that the 784 Patent does not use the term \u201cstable and pure, not degraded\u201d is insufficient to conclude that, as a matter of law, the Federal Court could not accept Dr. Beauchemin\u2019s definition of \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d. The Federal Court understood that the proper interpretation of the term depends on the POSITA\u2019s understanding. Further, the use of the term \u201cnon-toxic\u201d to describe the claimed salts does not necessarily determine the scope of \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d. As indicated at paragraph 19 above, the Federal Court accepted that non-toxicity was one quality of the claimed physiologically acceptable salt, but found that more was required. As indicated at paragraph 11 above, the term \u201cnon-toxic\u201d is used only once in the 784 Patent. It is used in a discussion of veterinary use of the invention; a corresponding paragraph discussing human use of the invention does not mention non-toxicity. In my view, it was open to the Federal Court to conclude that non-toxicity was not the only requirement of a physiologically acceptable salt in the context of the 784 Patent. I do not agree with the appellants\u2019 argument that the Federal Court\u2019s construction of the term \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d was purposeless and hence contrary to the principles of claim construction.\n[39] The appellants also criticize the Federal Court\u2019s reliance on \u201cthe amalgamated use of the terms physiologically with pharmaceutically acceptable\u201d as \u201cobviously elevat[ing] the threshold beyond what is merely not toxic or not harmful for the body\u201d: see paragraph 19 above and paragraph 90 of the Reasons. The appellants argue that the 784 Patent contains no amalgamated use of these terms. I agree that the use of these terms is not amalgamated in the sense of combining; it is not the combination of these terms that leads to an elevated threshold. However, in the context of the Federal Court\u2019s discussion of these terms, in which \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d and \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d are synonymous, I understand the Federal Court\u2019s use of the word \u201camalgamated\u201d to be simply a recognition that both contribute to the elevated threshold. I see no reviewable error here.\n[40] With respect to the appellants\u2019 concern that Dr. Beauchemin did not indicate that he took into account the relevant common general knowledge in determining how a POSITA would understand the term \u201cphysiologically acceptable\u201d, I see no problem. In fact, I see no issue at all. The POSITA from whose point of view patent claims are to be construed is, by definition, aware of all of the common general knowledge: see Free World Trust at para. 44, Whirlpool at para. 53. Dr. Beauchemin\u2019s consideration of the common general knowledge was implicit in his reference to the POSITA. Any doubt in this regard was for the Federal Court to consider. The appellants\u2019 attempt to distinguish the knowledge of the POSITA from the common general knowledge by reference to jurisprudence of this Court is misguided. That jurisprudence (Gemak Trust v. Jempak Corporation, 2022 FCA 141, 196 C.P.R. (4th) 215 at para. 96; Sandoz Canada Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, 2010 FCA 168, 85 C.P.R. (4th) 279 at para 27; and Novopharm Limited v. Janssen-Ortho Inc., 2007 FCA 217, 59 C.P.R. (4th) 116 at para. 25) was concerned with the distinction between prior art (or public knowledge) and common general knowledge. That is a distinction that is very important in some contexts, but I see no reason to conclude that it is relevant here.\nB. Insufficiency [41] Since the appellants\u2019 argument on insufficiency depends on the success of its argument on claim construction, and since I have concluded that the Federal Court did not err on its claim construction, it is not necessary to review the question of invalidity for insufficiency.\n[42] That said, I do wish to make a few comments about the Federal Court\u2019s discussion of the fact that putting the invention of the 784 Patent into practice would require completion of a minor research project. The Federal Court suggested that this was the reason for concluding that the claims in issue are invalid for insufficiency. However, the need to conduct a minor research project is not the determinant factor for insufficiency of a patent disclosure in the present context.\n[43] A finding of insufficiency is really a finding that the patent in question fails to meet the requirements of subsection 27(3) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4. This provision requires that the specification \u201ccorrectly and fully describe the invention and its operation or use as contemplated by the inventor\u201d in order that, \u201cwhen the period of the monopoly has expired the public will be able, having only the specification, to make the same successful use of the invention as the inventor could at the time of his application\u201d: Consolboard v. MacMillan Bloedel (Sask.) Ltd., [1981] 1 S.C.R. 504, 122 D.L.R. (3d) 203 at 520.\n[44] The reference to a minor research project seems to come from Teva Canada Ltd. v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2012 SCC 60, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 625 (Teva) where the Supreme Court of Canada found a patent invalid for insufficiency because a skilled reader of the patent in issue would be unable, without undertaking a minor research project, to determine which of two compounds was favoured by the inventors. As the Court in Teva stated at paragraph 76, \u201cPfizer had the information needed to disclose the useful compound and chose not to release it.\u201d In that sense, the patent specification in that case failed to meet the requirement to teach the public the same successful use of the invention as the inventor could at the time of the application.\n[45] The present appeal is not about the patentee\u2019s decision to withhold certain information, but rather a more general insufficiency of information in the patent specification. As this Court has stated several times in recent years, it remains the case that a patent specification may be sufficient even if some amount of non-inventive trial and error experimentation is required, so long as it is not undue: Teva Canada Limited v. Leo Pharma Inc., 2017 FCA 50, 145 C.P.R. (4th) 350 at para. 56; Bombardier Recreational Products Inc. v. Arctic Cat, Inc., 2018 FCA 172, 159 C.P.R. (4th) 319 at para. 78; Western Oilfield Equipment Rentals Ltd. v. M-I LLC, 2021 FCA 24, 331 A.C.W.S. (3d) 743 at para. 114; Seedlings Life Science Ventures, LLC v. Pfizer Canada ULC, 2021 FCA 154, 339 A.C.W.S. (3d) 69 at para. 68. Accordingly, a patent may be sufficient even if it requires a minor research project, provided no inventiveness or undue experimentation is involved.\n[46] The foregoing comments do not impair the Federal Court\u2019s finding of invalidity for insufficiency in this case. The Federal Court relied on testimony from the appellants\u2019 expert Dr. Byrn to the effect that salt formation is unpredictable, and \u201cthe search for salt requires a lot of experimental work and requires a skilled person to exercise some degree of inventiveness\u201d (see paragraph 65 of the Reasons). That is enough to support the conclusion of insufficiency.\nC. Overbreadth and Inutility [47] As with insufficiency, it is not necessary to review the question of invalidity for either overbreadth or inutility. However, my silence on the Federal Court\u2019s discussion of these issues should not be taken as agreement.\nVII. Conclusion [48] I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\"George R.

Elmaleh, 2006 FC 1096; Waterfurnace Inc. v. 803943 Ontario Ltd., [1991] F.C.J. No. 912).\n[4] For the sake of clarity, subsection 401(2) of the Rules reads as follows :\nCosts payable forthwith\n401 (2) Where the Court is satisfied that a motion should not have been brought or opposed, the Court shall order that the costs of the motion be payable forthwith.\nPaiement sans d\u00e9lai\n401 (2) Si la Cour est convaincue qu\u2019une requ\u00eate n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ou contest\u00e9e, elle ordonne que les d\u00e9pens aff\u00e9rents \u00e0 la requ\u00eate soient pay\u00e9s sans d\u00e9lai.\n[5] First, from my review of court file A-118-21 (consolidated with A-202-21), it appears that the substantive issues of this litigation remain outstanding, and no final decision has yet been made.\n[6] Second, for an assessment officer to have authority to proceed with an assessment of costs before final determination of the matter, an order under subsection 401(2) of the Rules for costs payable forthwith must be clear (Buck v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FC 352 at paras. 15-19). The absence of a \u201cforthwith\u201d provision in the Order indicates that Rule 401(2) is not applicable and therefore, the assessment of the Respondent\u2019s Bill of Costs is premature at this time of the litigation (Culhane v. ATP Aero Training Products Inc., 2004 FCA 367 at para. 7). In the absence of clear directions from the Court for disposition forthwith, I cannot address it at this stage.\n[7] Faced with the prematurity of this request for assessment, I did not issue a timetable to the parties to be making submissions on costs that, in the end, are not necessary at this time.\n[8] Under the circumstances, the assessment of the Respondent\u2019s Bill of Costs filed on April 10, 2024, will not take place at this stage of the proceedings. The Respondent may serve and file another request for assessment of costs in relation with the Motion once a final determination is made in this litigation.\n\u201cAudrey Blanchet\u201d\nAssessment Officer\nOttawa, Ontario\nApril 19, 2024\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nSOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-118-21 and A-202-21\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nHESAMEDDIN ABBASPOUR TAZEHKAND v.

McVeigh) that dismissed his application for judicial review of a decision of the Appeal Division of the Social Security Tribunal (SST). The Appeal Division decision in issue refused Mr. Kuk leave to appeal a decision of the General Division of the SST that found that he was not entitled to employment insurance (EI) benefits following his dismissal from employment with University Health Network (UHN) for failure to comply with its COVID-19 vaccination policy (the Vaccination Policy).\n[2] The General Division found that Mr. Kuk had been dismissed for misconduct (because his failure to comply with the Vaccination Policy was wilful) and, pursuant to section 30 of the Employment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996, c. 23, this disqualified him from receiving EI benefits. The Appeal Division noted the narrow scope of its jurisdiction to intervene (see subsection 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act, S.C. 2005, c. 34) and concluded that Mr. Kuk\u2019s appeal had no reasonable chance of success.\n[3] The Federal Court found the Appeal Division\u2019s decision to be reasonable and not tainted by any issue of procedural fairness.\n[4] Since we are concerned with an appeal from a decision on an application for judicial review, the task of this Court is to determine whether the Federal Court (i) selected the correct standard of review, and (ii) correctly applied that standard of review: Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559 at para. 45. Effectively, this Court must step into the shoes of the Federal Court, and focus on the Appeal Division\u2019s decision.\n[5] The Federal Court selected the reasonableness standard of review, and was correct in doing so. Accordingly, we must defer to the Appeal Division\u2019s decision, and we can intervene only if we are convinced that it was unreasonable in some respect. The only exception is in respect of procedural fairness, in respect of which we do not defer to the Appeal Division.\n[6] Mr. Kuk argues on various grounds that he had no obligation to comply with the Vaccination Policy, and hence his failure to comply with it was not misconduct. However, Mr. Kuk did not take issue before the Appeal Division with the fact that he was dismissed because UHN concluded he had failed to comply with the Vaccination Policy (see paragraph 15 of the Appeal Division\u2019s decision).\n[7] The Appeal Division made the following observations:\nMisconduct results from an act that is wilful, and does not require any wrongful intent (see paragraph 18 of the Appeal Division\u2019s decision).\nThe General Division\u2019s role was not to determine whether Mr. Kuk\u2019s dismissal was unjustified, but rather (i) whether he was guilty of misconduct as defined, and (ii) whether that misconduct led to his dismissal (see paragraph 19 of the Appeal Division\u2019s decision).\nIt was not for the SST to consider the merits of the Vaccination Policy (see paragraph 27 of the Appeal Division\u2019s decision).\nAny question of the employer\u2019s misconduct was a matter for another forum (see paragraph 30 of the Appeal Division\u2019s decision).\n[8] The Appeal Division found that Mr. Kuk made a deliberate choice not to comply with the Vaccination Policy, and that this was misconduct that resulted in his dismissal (see paragraphs 33 and 35 of the Appeal Division\u2019s decision).\n[9] In our view, this conclusion was entirely reasonable. Mr. Kuk has not convinced us that his case should be distinguished from at least four recent decisions of this Court in similar circumstances: Lalancette v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 CAF 58; Sullivan v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 7; Zhelkov v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 240, 2023 A.C.W.S. 6179; Francis v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 217.\n[10] Mr. Kuk also argues various breaches of procedural fairness. However, the issues he raises do not concern procedural fairness, in which the ultimate question is whether Mr. Kuk knew the case he had to meet, had an opportunity to respond and had an impartial decision maker consider his case fully and fairly: see Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69, 291 A.C.W.S. (3d) 8 at para. 41. Mr. Kuk has given us no reason to doubt that he was given procedural fairness.\n[11] For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss the appeal. The respondent does not seek costs in this appeal, and we will not award any.\n\"George R.

Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 31 (per Southcott J.). In that judgment, the Federal Court dismissed the appellants\u2019 application challenging the process by which judges are appointed under section 96 and 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867. The appellants alleged that the appointment process is subject to political discretionary control, influence, and interference by the federal Minister of Justice and Cabinet. The appellants argued before the Federal Court that such control, influence, and interference undermines the institutional independence of the judiciary in violation of sections 7, 11(d), and 24 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and section 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867.\n[2] Before us, the appellants submit that the Federal Court made reviewable errors in both its evidentiary rulings, in which it found much of the appellants\u2019 evidence to be inadmissible, and in its treatment of the merits of their application.\n[3] As concerns the evidentiary rulings, the Federal Court struck several paragraphs in the two affidavits of one of the appellants, Duff Conacher, as well as several exhibits to those affidavits. The Federal Court found that these paragraphs and exhibits were either inadmissible hearsay evidence or inadmissible opinion evidence that was not tendered by a qualified expert witness. The Federal Court also held that the opinion evidence that the appellants sought to admit was irrelevant to the issues before it since the Court was required to apply an objective test to ascertain whether judges and courts may be reasonably perceived as independent.\n[4] Much of the evidence struck by the Federal Court consisted of newspaper articles, editorials, and opinion pieces published in newspapers or on newspapers\u2019 websites. In addition, the Federal Court struck a letter from the Canadian Judicial Council (the CJC), a 2016 report from the International Commission of Jurists of Canada (the ICJC), an article written by a legal academic, and submissions from the President of the Canadian Bar Association (the CBA) and other associations regarding the judicial appointment process. The Federal Court found that the latter sort of submissions and the academic article, while inadmissible as opinion evidence, could nonetheless be referred to by the appellants as authorities in support of their submissions.\n[5] Before us, the appellants submit that the Federal Court made palpable and overriding errors in finding some of the foregoing evidence inadmissible. More particularly, they submit that the Federal Court ought to have found that two of the newspaper articles and the letter from the CJC, which the Federal Court struck as inadmissible hearsay, met the twin criteria for admissibility of reliability and necessity, and that the Federal Court erred in concluding otherwise. They also submit that the Federal Court erred in finding some of the evidence to be inadmissible opinion evidence, arguing that, contrary to what the Federal Court found, some of the opinion pieces published in newspapers, the report from the ICJC, and the statement from the President of the CBA, that the Federal Court characterized as opinion evidence, should have been accepted as reliable and necessary factual evidence or as being similar to evidence that relied on in Libman v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 569, [1997] S.C.J. No. 85 (QL) [Libman], Harper v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 33, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 827 [Harper], and R. v. Bryan, 2007 SCC 12, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 527 [Bryan].\n[6] I disagree and, with one minor exception that is not germane to the outcome of this appeal, see no error in any of the Federal Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings.\n[7] Newspaper articles are generally inadmissible as hearsay and lack the necessary reliability to be admitted as evidence before a court: see e.g. Tsleil-Waututh Nation v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 104, 292 A.C.W.S. (3d) 678 at para. 39; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Canadian Council for Refugees, 2021 FCA 72, [2021] 3 F.C.R. 294 at para. 150, rev\u2019d (on other grounds) 2023 SCC 17, 481 D.L.R. (4th) 581. There is no basis for setting aside the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion regarding the inadmissibility of the newspaper articles that the appellants allege should have been admitted.\n[8] I agree with the appellants that the Federal Court mischaracterized Exhibit \u201cF\u201d to the first affidavit of Mr. Conacher as a newspaper article at paragraph 33 of its Reasons. In fact, as the Federal Court acknowledged at paragraph 32 of its Reasons, Exhibit \u201cF\u201d to the first affidavit of Mr. Conacher is a letter taken from the website of CJC. In that letter, the CJC reported, among other things, that a member of the judiciary acknowledged that she provided the names of potential judicial appointments to the office of the Minister of Justice in response to inquiries.\n[9] Despite this mischaracterization, I agree with the Federal Court that Exhibit \u201cF\u201d to Mr. Conacher\u2019s first affidavit includes inadmissible hearsay. The fact that a member of the judiciary acknowledged providing names of potential future appointments, as reported in the CJC\u2019s letter, is hearsay. I see no reviewable error in the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that the appellants failed to establish the necessity of tendering the letter to establish the foregoing fact in light of their failure to tender any evidence regarding their inability to obtain direct evidence of the facts reported in the letter. In any event, the fact that consultations about appointments are undertaken by the Minister of Justice is not and was not denied by the respondent. Other such consultations are referenced in Exhibits \u201cC\u201d, \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d to Mr. Conacher\u2019s second affidavit that the Federal Court allowed to stand.\n[10] Turning to the items struck as being opinion evidence that the appellants impugn, the opinion pieces that appeared in newspapers or on websites are not factual, and to the extent they set out factual statements, are inadmissible hearsay for the reasons already noted. The portions of the report from the ICJC that the appellants seek to rely on is hearsay to the extent it reports on undisclosed surveys completed by ICJC members. There was no evidence from the appellants to support the reliability or the necessity of the admission of these hearsay statements. The balance of the ICJC report either outlines the appointment process, which was already before the Federal Court through direct evidence from the respondent\u2019s witness, or provides the opinion of the ICJC as to how the judicial appointment process could be modified. As for the letter from the President of the CBA, it sets out the opinion of that Association and is not factual.\n[11] It is not disputed that these opinions were not offered by an expert and were not subject to cross-examination. As noted in Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 SCC 22, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 772 at paragraph 43, where relevant, evidence about surveys of public opinion must be presented through a duly-qualified expert, who can be cross-examined about matters such as the survey design and conduct. Moreover, the expressions of opinion in the newspaper opinion pieces, the ICJC report, and the letter from the President of the CBA are distinguishable from the surveys and reports referred to in the Libman, Harper and Bryan cases. As the respondent rightly notes, the reports in those cases were either introduced through experts or were of an entirely different nature, such as the Royal Commission report that was before the Court in Bryan. None of the foregoing cases involved a party seeking to introduce opinion evidence through a lay witness, similar to what the appellants sought to tender in this case.\n[12] I accordingly see no error in the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion to disallow the opinion pieces, the ICJC Report, or the statement from the President of the CBA.\n[13] What the Federal Court was left with, and what is now before this Court, amounts to pure speculation about possible inappropriate considerations that might come into play in the judicial appointment process. Indeed, before us, the appellants cast their submissions in the form of what \u201ccould happen\u201d in that process and the potential for a governing party to use candidates\u2019 past political affiliations as an important criterion for appointment. However, there is no evidence this occurred. The mere fact that the Minister of Justice appoints some of the members of Judicial Advisory Committees or may consult with others, including with cabinet colleagues, about potential judicial appointments falls well short of establishing that the institutional independence of the judiciary is undermined in violation of sections 7, 11(d) and 24 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and section 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867.\n[14] I therefore conclude that the Federal Court did not err in dismissing the appellants\u2019 application. In the circumstances, I decline to make any comment on whether, in an appropriate case, a court might reach a different conclusion if there were different admissible evidence before it about the functioning or composition of Judicial Advisory Committees or consultations undertaken in the appointment process. That is best left for another day. I would therefore decline to draw a bright\u2013line conclusion that the only essential conditions for institutional judicial independence are security of tenure, security of remuneration, and administrative independence. Indeed, in Valente v. The Queen, 1985 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 673, the Supreme Court did not firmly foreclose the possibility that judicial independence might one day be found to encompass additional elements.\n[15] I would accordingly dismiss this appeal. Although the respondent has requested costs, I would make no costs award for the same reasons that the Federal Court declined to award them.\n\u201cMary J.L.

C-34 (the Act). They sought an order removing plaintiffs\u2019 counsel as counsel of record, alleging that counsel had received relevant confidential information in the course of a prior retainer of a lawyer who was, at one point, also counsel to the defendants.\n[2] The Federal Court dismissed the appellants\u2019 motion (Ingarra v. Dye & Durham Limited, 2023 FC 1046, 2023 CarswellNat 5572 per Gascon J.). The Court found that the appellants had not established that relevant information, let alone confidential information, was shared in the course of the former retainer. The Court also found that the former and present retainers were not sufficiently related to justify the presumption that relevant confidential information had been imparted.\n[3] The Federal Court erred in finding that retainers under sections 45 and 79 of the Act were not sufficiently related. It is, however, an error of no consequence. While a finding of sufficient relationship shifted the burden to the respondents to prove that no confidential information was received, the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion that no information was in fact shared was amply supported by the evidence and fully responds to the presumption. This finding is dispositive of the appeal.\nThe retainers giving rise to the alleged conflict\n[4] Dye & Durham Limited (Dye & Durham) provides technology solutions for legal and business professionals. It amalgamated with OneMove Technologies Inc. (OneMove) in 2016. OneMove provided web-based real estate transaction platforms, including a real estate conveyancing software platform \u201ceConveyance\u2122\u201d (eConveyance). Dye & Durham now operates eConveyance. OneMove\u2019s former Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Matthew Proud, is now CEO of Dye & Durham.\n[5] The appellant DoProcess offered several products related to real estate conveyancing, including the software \u201cConveyancer\u201d, now rebranded as \u201cUnity\u201d. Dye & Durham acquired DoProcess in December 2020.\n[6] Nicholas Cartel and Glenn Brandys, lawyers from Cartel & Bui LLP (Cartel & Bui), and Calvin Goldman were counsel of record to the proposed class action plaintiffs. Mr. Goldman is now at his own firm, but was formerly the Chair of the Competition, Antitrust and Foreign Investment Group at Goodmans LLP (Goodmans).\n[7] In 2014, Mr. Proud called Mr. Goldman, then at Goodmans, to seek advice about a potential abuse of dominance complaint under section 79 of the Act against DoProcess on the basis that DoProcess prevented eConveyance\u2019s expansion into Ontario. Mr. Goldman later advised OneMove that Goodmans was withdrawing from that retainer due to a business conflict.\n[8] In 2015 and 2016, Mr. Goldman acted for Information Services Corporation (ISC) in relation to its investment in OneMove and in relation to OneMove\u2019s abuse of dominance complaint against DoProcess. ISC and OneMove agreed to a joint defence agreement for the purpose of the abuse of dominance complaint, but the agreement provided that no lawyer-client relationship would be created with the other party\u2019s counsel. In the course of this retainer Mr. Goldman received a copy of OneMove\u2019s abuse of dominance complaint submitted to the Competition Bureau.\n[9] Before the Federal Court, the appellants submitted that Mr. Goldman obtained confidential or commercially sensitive information including information about OneMove\u2019s business and views on the conveyancing software industry, a description of eConveyance and its application, how OneMove\u2019s products compared to those offered by DoProcess as well as Mr. Proud\u2019s views on the importance of integrating conveyancing software with title insurance and land registry operators.\nThe litigation and the motion to remove counsel\n[10] In April 2022, the respondents brought a class action against Dye & Durham alleging a conspiracy to increase the price of real estate conveyancing software through Dye & Durham\u2019s acquisition of DoProcess from OMERS Infrastructure Management Inc., contrary to section 45 of the Act and resulting in damages under section 36 of the Act.\n[11] Shortly thereafter, Dye & Durham raised concerns about Mr. Goldman\u2019s previous involvement in competition matters with OneMove. Consequently, Mr. Goldman withdrew as counsel, although he did not acknowledge that he was in a conflict of interest. Cartel & Bui did not withdraw, however, giving rise to the motion in the Federal Court. The thrust of the appellants\u2019 motion was that Cartel & Bui was tainted because of Mr. Goldman\u2019s alleged conflict and should therefore also be removed as counsel.\n[12] The Federal Court dismissed the motion to remove Cartel & Bui, giving rise to this appeal.\nThe principles governing the removal of counsel\n[13] Two questions are asked in determining whether a conflict of interest exists: did the lawyer receive confidential information attributable to a solicitor-client relationship relevant to the matter at hand, and, if so, is there a risk that it will be used to the prejudice of the client? A conflict of interest has been defined as a \u201csubstantial risk that the lawyer\u2019s representation of the client would be materially and adversely affected by the lawyer\u2019s own interests or by the lawyer\u2019s duties to another current client, a former client, or a third person\u201d. (See R. v. Neil, 2002 SCC 70, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 631, MacDonald Estate v. Martin, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1235, 1990 CanLII 32, [Martin], and Canadian National Railway Co. v. McKercher LLP, 2013 SCC 39, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 649 [McKercher])\n[14] The moving party bears the onus of establishing that relevant confidential information was shared. This can be discharged either by showing evidence that confidential information was in fact imparted to the lawyer during the solicitor-client relationship, or by showing that the new retainer is \u201csufficiently related\u201d to the matters covered in the prior relationship. To find a conflict on the basis that the matters are sufficiently related, the information previously imparted to the lawyer must be \u201ccapable of being used against the client\u201d in a \u201ctangible manner\u201d (McKercher at para. 54, MediaTube Corp. v. Bell Canada, 2014 FC 237, 126 C.P.R. (4th) 245 at para. 109 [MediaTube]).\n[15] When a retainer is sufficiently related, a rebuttable presumption is created that the lawyer or firm received confidential information. Ancillary to this, it is also assumed that the information received by the \u201ctainted\u201d lawyer would be shared with the lawyer\u2019s affiliates, such as is alleged in the case before us (Martin at 1262). The presumption can be rebutted by demonstrating that no confidential information was actually shared, or by demonstrating that the information is not relevant to the matter at hand (MediaTube at paras. 28 and 116, GCT Canada Limited Partnership v. Vancouver Fraser Port Authority, 2019 FC 1147, 312 A.C.W.S. (3d) 861 at para. 82 [GCT]).\n[16] In considering a motion to remove counsel, a court must balance the public interest in maintaining confidence in the integrity of the bar and consequently, the judicial system, against a party\u2019s right of choice of counsel and the desirability for reasonable mobility within the legal profession (Martin at 1243). In considering these factors, courts have generally exercised restraint before interfering with a party\u2019s choice of counsel. However, once it is found that confidential information was disclosed and could be used to the detriment of a client, the lawyer is disqualified. The client\u2019s right to confidentiality trumps the lawyer\u2019s desire for mobility (Strother v. 3464920 Canada Inc., 2007 SCC 24, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 177 at para. 51).\nThe Federal Court decision\n[17] The Federal Court noted the differences between proceedings under section 45 of the Act, a criminal provision, and section 79, a civil provision. The Court pointed out that the focus under section 45 is whether there is an agreement between competitors and an intention to enter into that agreement. Proof of anti-competitive effect is not required. In contrast, section 79 directs an inquiry into whether the acts have had or are likely to have the effect of preventing or lessening competition substantially, with issues like market definition, anti-competitive effects, and the conduct of competitors being central. The judge found that the information purportedly shared with Mr. Goldman in the context of a section 79 investigation \u201cconcerns different and unrelated principles of competition law that have nothing to do with this proposed class action\u201d and that the retainers were therefore not sufficiently related (Federal Court decision at paras. 68-73).\n[18] Notwithstanding his finding that the retainers were not sufficiently related from a legal perspective, the judge nevertheless considered whether the information received by Mr. Goldman in the prior retainers was capable of being used against the appellants in any tangible manner. The Court concluded that the information received was not part of the factual context directly informing Cartel & Bui in the proposed class action. The Court also noted that the possibility that information from the prior retainers could have some peripheral relevance was insufficient, and that the Court should not have to \u201cguess at the degree of connection\u201d between the retainers and the information (Federal Court decision at paras. 75-76 and 89). The Court acknowledged that even if Mr. Proud\u2019s view of the competitive marketplace were theoretically relevant to the mens rea of the offence under section 45 of the Act, this did not constitute a sufficient connection, and that in any event the mens rea under section 45 is met only when it is demonstrated that the competitors intentionally entered into the agreement (Federal Court decision at paras. 83-84).\n[19] The Court pointed to the generality of the evidence asserted to have been shared, noting that the appellants \u201coffered no more than a bare assertion that the past relationships with OneMove provided Mr. Goldman with access to Dye & Durham\u2019s strategic and tactical decision-making processes that would directly inform the Plaintiffs in the proposed class action\u201d (Federal Court decision at para. 67).\n[20] The Court therefore found that the first prong of the conflicts test under Martin was not met.\nThe issues before this Court\n[21] The core of the appellants\u2019 submission is that the Federal Court erred in the assessment of whether Mr. Goldman\u2019s prior retainers with respect to abuse of dominance under section 79 of the Act were sufficiently related to the proposed class action alleging a conspiracy under section 45 of the Act. More specifically, the appellants allege that the Federal Court erred by focusing on the differences between the elements of sections 45 and 79 of the Act and ignoring the factual elements they share in common. They say that the relationship between the two provisions is recognized in the Act itself; section 45.1 and subsection 79(7) prohibit proceedings under both sections \u201con the basis of facts that are the same or substantially the same\u201d. The appellants also point to section 45 jurisprudence which included analysis of the products and product markets, and the relationships between competitors, citing Watson v. Bank of America Corporation, 2015 BCCA 362, 389 D.L.R. (4th) 577 and Difederico v. Amazon.com, Inc., 2023 FC 1156, 2023 A.C.W.S. 5341.\n[22] The appellants also argue the judge erred in holding that market information was not relevant to claims under section 45 of the Act in the face of appellate jurisprudence confirming that the mens rea element under section 45 includes \u201can objective intention to do one or more of the things described in paragraphs 45(1)(a)-(c)\u201d, and despite Mr. Goldman\u2019s admission that market information relevant to an abuse of dominance complaint is also relevant to the mens rea of the section 45 offence (Shah v. LG Chem Ltd., 2018 ONCA 819, 142 O.R. (3d) 721 at para. 50, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 38440 (17 October 2019)).\n[23] The appellants further contend that the judge erred in failing to find that information relevant to section 79 of the Act is relevant to the damages analysis under section 36 of the Act. Injury to competition and the market, a requisite of section 79, is also relevant to penalty and damages under section 45. Loss or damage under section 36 uses expert evidence in the form of economic models and methodologies typically involving market information which would be relevant in an abuse of dominance proceeding.\n[24] The appellants submit that these errors vitiate the conclusions of the Court as well as its treatment of the evidence. Had the Court not made these legal errors, it would have found that Mr. Goldman\u2019s prior mandates were sufficiently related to the present case, creating rebuttable presumptions that Mr. Goldman had relevant confidential information and that he shared it with Cartel & Bui.\n[25] The appellants submit that Cartel & Bui cannot rebut the above presumptions. The denials of receipt of confidential information in the affidavits of Cartel & Bui are of little use, as objective evidence is required to rebut the presumption that confidential information was imparted. They say that the argument that the statement of claim is constructed of publicly available information is irrelevant since the concern lies with a future risk that confidential information will be used to the detriment of the former client.\n[26] The respondent\u2019s principal argument is that the judge made no error in finding that the retainers were not sufficiently related. Alternatively, they contend that the Federal Court\u2019s determination that no confidential information was in fact imparted is, as a practical matter, determinative. Put otherwise, even if a rebuttable presumption arises that Cartel & Bui possesses relevant confidential information, the Federal Court\u2019s factual determinations rebut the presumption. The judge\u2019s factual findings also respond to the question of any future risk of misuse of relevant confidential information. As no information was imparted at all, the question of future risk cannot arise. The respondents note that the judge\u2019s evidentiary findings were not challenged on appeal.\n[27] As I mentioned at the outset, I agree with the respondents\u2019 alternative argument and would dispose of the appeal on this basis.\nWhether sections 45 and 79 of the Act are sufficiently related\n[28] The Federal Court judge conducted a thorough and thoughtful analysis of sections 45 and 79 of the Act. From a competition law perspective, the analysis is unimpeachable. The appellants\u2019 argument, however, and with which I agree, is that the Federal Court did not consider whether or not the two proceedings were, from a conflicts perspective, sufficiently related.\n[29] The question of whether the retainers are sufficiently related is answered from an objective standpoint, taking into account the perspective of the reasonably informed client who may be troubled by their former lawyer now acting against them. The answer to the question of sufficient relationship also takes into account the primary purpose of the rule, which is to preserve public confidence in the integrity of the bar.\n[30] An offence is committed under section 45 when a person conspires, agrees or arranges with a competitor to fix prices, allocate sales, territories, customers or markets or restrict output in respect of a product or service. Section 79, in contrast, prohibits businesses from abusing their dominant position. It requires proof that a business with substantial control of a class or segment of a business has engaged in an anti-competitive act or practice that has substantially lessened or prevented competition.\n[31] Notwithstanding the key differences, rightly noted by the judge, there is a limited, but certain, underlying commonality to the provisions. Retainers under sections 45 and 79 may share many of the same facts which frame the legal advice offered. Each requires an understanding of a relevant market and of a relevant product. Each requires an understanding of existing business practices. In the case of abuse proceedings, these elements are central to the inquiry; in the section 45 inquiry, they are contextual. The close factual overlap between the provisions is recognized in the Act itself: section 45.1 provides that where an order has been sought against a person under section 79, no proceedings can be commenced under subsection 45(1) against that person \u201con the basis of facts that are the same or substantially the same\u201d.\n[32] The mens rea for an offence under section 45 also illustrates the factual overlap between actions under sections 45 and 79. The Federal Court noted that the mens rea for section 45 offences \u201cis met when it is demonstrated that the competitors intentionally entered into the agreement\u201d (Federal Court decision at para. 84). While this is correct, the mens rea for a section 45 offence also includes an objective assessment of the conduct of the parties in relation to an intent to achieve one of the prohibited ends found in paragraphs 45(1)(a), (b), or (c) (Shah at para. 50). This portion of the inquiry focuses on contextual intention and market and business factors beyond the agreement itself.\n[33] The determination that the retainers were sufficiently related from a legal perspective does not, however, end the matter.\n[34] The presumption that confidential information has been shared can be rebutted by proving that no information was actually imparted, or that no information was imparted that could be relevant, such that a reasonably informed member of the public would be satisfied that no misuse of any confidential information would occur (Martin at 1260-1261). In this regard, to warrant removal, the information previously imparted to the lawyer must be \u201ccapable of being used against the client\u201d in a \u201ctangible manner\u201d (McKercher at para. 54; MediaTube at para. 28).\n[35] This is a relatively high threshold. The information must likely be part of the factual context directly informing counsel\u2019s advice to the new client (Chapters Inc. v. Davies, Ward & Beck LLP, 2001 CanLII 24189 (ONCA), 52 O.R. (3d) 566 at para. 36 [Chapters]), or there must be points of connection or strategic insight acquired that have been identified by the moving party so as to move the allegation from hypothetical to likely. Contextual, generalized information will not meet the standard. The information must be capable of being used to the detriment of the former client.\n[36] A relation sufficient to warrant removal is not established by the mere fact that the legal issues in the two retainers intersect and overlap or that the lawyer acquired relevant legal knowledge and skills during the former retainer. Similarly, the possibility that a lawyer has insight into their former client\u2019s \u201cgeneral \u2026 litigation philosophy\u201d will generally not suffice (McKercher at para. 54). Specific insight acquired into the former client\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, character and personality traits or litigation strategy will be more significant (Skii km Lax Ha v. Malii, 2021 BCCA 140, [2021] 9 W.W.R. 622 at para. 39 [Malii], citing Le Soleil Hospitality Inc. v. Louie, 2010 BCSC 1954, [2010] B.C.J. No. 2821 at paras. 34-36). As I will explain, nothing in the evidence reaches this level.\nThe evidence\n[37] The presumption that information has been shared arising from a finding that the briefs were sufficiently related is rebutted by a finding that no information has been imparted (GCT at para. 82). The judge\u2019s conclusion that no information was imparted is therefore conclusive. I also add that this is the only conclusion open on the evidence.\n[38] The judge found that there was \u201cno realistic possibility\u201d that relevant confidential information was provided to Mr. Goldman in his prior retainers (Federal Court decision at para. 42). At the risk of generalization, the reasons of the Federal Court can be distilled to the following:\na)There was no evidence of confidential information, as the descriptions of information provided by the appellants were generic, publicly available from multiple sources and common knowledge among practitioners in the field. The Court noted that the evidence establishing that Cartel & Bui only used publicly available information to prepare the statement of claim had not been contradicted, which \u201ctips the scales\u201d in favour of the respondents (Federal Court decision at paras. 46 and 48).\nb)The allegation that Mr. Goldman had obtained relevant confidential information was merely theoretical. While the appellants did not have to explain the details of their relationship with Mr. Goldman and the claimed confidential information, they still had to describe the confidential information sufficiently so as to allow the Court to determine its nature (Federal Court decision at para. 52).\nc)In any event, there was no evidence of any confidential information shared with Cartel & Bui. The affidavits of Mr. Cartel and Mr. Brandys state that Mr. Goldman had no role in the research, investigation, and drafting of the statement of claim (Federal Court decision at para. 55).\nd)The judge was unable to determine the actual nature of the asserted confidential information. Mr. Goldman received no documents in the context of the 2014 retainer and had no recollection of Mr. Proud or the single phone call he had with him. Further, the retainers in 2014 and 2016 were in respect of alleged anti-competitive behaviour in a product market and business environment that existed prior to those dates. The allegation in the section 45 proceeding is in respect of an agreement alleged to have been reached in 2020 with damages arising subsequent to the agreement (Federal Court decision at paras. 46, 49 and 51).\n[39] It is instructive, in this respect, to contrast the vagueness of the evidence before the Federal Court with that in GCT and Chapters. There, the parties provided descriptions of specific documents containing confidential information, such as board minutes, expert reports and financial statements. The evidence here does not have that degree of particularity.\n[40] I also stress the judge\u2019s finding that the descriptions of the documents and information imparted were \u201cvery generic, with no specific documents or categories of documents identified\u201d (Federal Court decision at paras. 42-46). Importantly, the judge was unable to determine what was, in fact, asserted to be \u201cconfidential\u201d. These findings were open to the judge on the evidence and no reviewable error has been demonstrated.\n[41] There was, in any event, affirmative evidence before the judge that responded to the presumption. This included detailed evidence cross-referencing each of the allegations in the statement of claim to multiple, publicly available sources.

The Agency is not a party to the appeal. Nevertheless, after the parties to the appeal filed their memoranda of fact and law with the Court, the Agency presented to the Court its own memorandum of fact and law.\n[2] In support of this, the Agency invokes subsection 41(4) of the Canada Transportation Act, S.C. 1996, c. 10. Subsection 41(4) provides that the Canadian Transportation Agency \u201cis entitled to be heard by counsel or otherwise on the argument of an appeal\u201d under the Act. The Agency says it can participate as of right in an appeal from its own decision.\n[3] For some time now, the Court and other parties have raised questions about the operation of the subsection. Many are canvassed in these reasons. Those questions largely have not been answered.\n[4] Fundamentally, can the Agency do what it proposes to do here? Are there any procedural or substantive limits on this?\n[5] These questions are surprisingly complex. They have troubled this Court for a long time. Therefore, in this case, the Court issued a direction to the parties to provide submissions on these questions.\n[6] Overall, the Court construes this matter as an informal motion for directions under Rule 54 of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106.\n[7] The Court will grant this motion. It directs that the Agency\u2019s memorandum of fact and law shall be filed and the Agency may participate in the hearing of this appeal.\n[8] Subsection 41(4) of the Act is rather unique in Canadian law.\n[9] Under most administrative regimes, the governing legislation does not give the administrative decision-maker the right to be heard on an appeal from its own decisions. But subsection 41(4) gives that right to the Agency.\n[10] Among other things, subsection 41(4) must be seen in light of the context in which it sits. One important part of the context is the case law governing whether and the extent to which an administrative decision-maker can participate in an appeal or judicial review from one of its own decisions.\n[11] The current position is that once an administrative decision-maker decides a matter, giving full and adequate reasons for its decision, it is finished with the matter. Theoretically, when a party applies for judicial review of the decision or appeals from the decision, the administrative decision-maker can apply for leave to intervene. But if leave to intervene is granted, the decision-maker must proceed with restraint and caution.\n[12] The Supreme Court has expressed very clearly the need for administrative decision-makers who participate in judicial reviews and appeals to proceed with restraint and caution: Ontario (Energy Board) v. Ontario Power Generation Inc., 2015 SCC 44, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 147; Northwestern Utilities Ltd. v. City of Edmonton, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 684.\n[13] Restraint and caution are needed because of an important concern: an administrative decision-maker must be and must appear to be impartial as between the parties. Thus, except in the decision-maker\u2019s own interlocutory and final decisions, it should not take sides or appear to take sides.\n[14] This concern remains live in a judicial review or appeal. The reviewing court might set aside the administrative decision and return it to the administrative decision-maker for redetermination of the matter on its merits. In the redetermination, the administrative decision-maker will have to act with the appearance and reality of impartiality. If the administrative decision-maker has involved itself in a judicial review or an appeal and aggressively advocates for the position it adopted in its reasons, its appearance and reality of impartiality may suffer.\n[15] The sending back of a matter to an administrative decision-maker for redetermination of the merits is not a remote possibility. Far from it. In fact, in cases where reviewing courts set aside decisions, it is the usual remedy. This is because governing legislative regimes almost always empower administrative decision-makers to decide matters on their merits, not reviewing courts. The alternative\u2014the reviewing court deciding the merits of the matter\u2014is truly rare. Reviewing courts impose their view of the merits of the matter only in rarely occurring situations or \u201climited scenarios\u201d where, for example, no other outcome is available to administrative decision-makers: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653 at para. 142 and Immeubles Port Louis Lt\u00e9e v. Lafontaine (Village), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 326; and see also Community Panel of the Adams Lake Indian Band v. Adams Lake Band, 2011 FCA 37, 21 Admin. L.R. (5th) 105 and D\u2019Errico v. Canada (Attorney General), 2014 FCA 95, 459 N.R. 167 (very compelling public interest reasons).\n[16] On this point, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Vavilov remains the law. Recent unexplained deviations from this principle by the Supreme Court, seemingly at odds with Vavilov, should not be seen as a departure from the principle: see Ontario (Attorney General) v. Ontario (Information and Privacy Commissioner), 2024 SCC 4, Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest v. Northwest Territories (Education, Culture and Employment), 2023 SCC 31 and Mason v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 21, 485 D.L.R. (4th) 583; and for the significance to be attributed to the Supreme Court\u2019s unexplained deviations in individual cases, see Paul Daly, \u201cThe Signal and the Noise in Administrative Law\u201d (2017), 2016 CanLIIDocs 275.\n[17] A further concern is \u201cbootstrapping\u201d: administrative decision-makers making submissions to reviewing courts that, in reality, are new reasons supporting the decisions they made. This undermines two principles. First, administrative decision-makers must provide all necessary explanations in support of their decisions in their reasons and, if they fail to do that, their decisions may be set aside: Vavilov at para. 83. Second, after administrative decision-makers have decided matters, including explaining themselves in their reasons, they are functus or finished and, without legislative authorization, they cannot touch the matters again: Chandler v. Alberta Association of Architects, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 848.\n[18] While the Supreme Court in Ontario Power Generation does not absolutely prohibit administrative decision-makers from intervening in an appeal, it has underscored the need for them to exercise restraint and caution for many of the reasons just mentioned. Ontario Power Generation confirms that a reviewing court in a judicial review or an appeal has the discretion, depending on the circumstances, to prevent, restrain or regulate the involvement of administrative decision-makers.\n[19] Before us here is subsection 41(4) of the Canada Transportation Act. As a legislative provision, it prevails over any inconsistent judge-made law, such as the judge-made principles set out above, unless the legislative provision is constitutionally invalid: Ocean Port Hotel Ltd. v. British Columbia (General Manager, Liquor Control and Licensing Branch), 2001 SCC 52, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 781; see also C.U.P.E. v. Ontario (Minister of Labour), 2003 SCC 29, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 539 at para. 117. Canada (Attorney General) v. Utah, 2020 FCA 224, 455 D.L.R. (4th) 714 at para. 28 and Sturgeon Lake Cree National v. Hamelin, 2018 FCA 131, 424 D.L.R. (4th) 366 at para. 54.\n[20] Subsection 41(4) provides that the Agency \u201cis entitled to be heard by counsel or otherwise on the argument of an appeal\u201d under the Act. Unfortunately, the exact meaning and scope of subsection 41(4) of the Canada Transportation Act has never been settled in our jurisprudence. As well, its interrelationship with the Federal Courts Rules has never been discussed.\n[21] Many questions arise from subsection 41(4) and the Rules. Is the Agency\u2019s involvement in an appeal a matter of right or does the Court have a discretion to deny entry into the appeal? When can the Agency involve itself in an appeal? How should it go about it? Does it need to bring a motion to involve itself in an appeal? When should it notify the Court that it intends to involve itself in an appeal? Are there limitations on what the Agency can do in an appeal?\n[22] The parties have not acquainted the Court with the purposes underlying subsection 41(4), nor has the Court been able to ascertain them with any specificity. All that can be said is that Parliament was evidently of the view that the Agency may need to have a say in a particular appeal.\n[23] To some extent, the Court can understand the reasons behind this. The Canada Transportation Act and associated regulations are complex and many of their requirements have serious ramifications for public safety and the larger public interest. These reasons support the view that subsection 41(4) means exactly what its text says: the Agency can involve itself in an appeal whenever it considers it necessary.\n[24] There is nothing to suggest that the Agency need be given any formal status before the Court, such as a respondent or an intervener. Subsection 41(4) gives it the right to be heard but it gives it no other rights, such as those possessed by a respondent or an intervener. The presence of the Agency in the appeal will be memorialized by listing the Agency on the backsheet of the Court\u2019s reasons. If the Agency requires a higher degree of participation than that afforded to it under subsection 41(4), such as that of a respondent or an intervener, it may seek that by motion.\n[25] Parliament introduced subsection 41(4) in 1996, well after the Supreme Court\u2019s case of Northwestern Utilities in 1978 in which the Supreme Court expressed concern about the involvement of an administrative decision-maker in an appeal from its own decision. Ontario Power Generation, a post-1996 decision, in substance does not introduce concerns different from Northwestern Utilities but is more permissive than Northwestern Utilities about the participation of administrative decision-makers in appeals. One can only conclude that, notwithstanding the concern in Northwestern Utilities, Parliament has decided that the Agency should have standing to speak to an appeal from one of its decisions.\n[26] Except for one matter, subsection 41(4) does not speak to any procedural issues. In particular, it does not speak to how it should work alongside the Rules. The one matter is that the Agency has the right to be heard as of right. Therefore, the Agency need not ask for leave to participate in the appeal, such as following Rule 109 to seek leave to intervene in the appeal.\n[27] In all respects, then, the Rules have full application to the Agency in this context. Foremost among these is Rule 3, the need for proceedings to go forward in the most expeditious and least expensive way. On most occasions, the Agency cannot assess whether to participate in an appeal until it has seen the parties\u2019 memoranda. As soon as those memoranda have been filed, if the Agency intends to participate in the appeal, it should notify the Court immediately.\n[28] Subsection 41(4) speaks to the Agency being \u201centitled to be heard by counsel or otherwise\u201d. This means literally that, upon advising the Court and the parties of its intention to participate, the Agency has the right to file a memorandum and make oral submissions, only file a memorandum, or only make oral submissions.\n[29] The Agency will have to act in a manner that affords procedural fairness to the other parties. If the Agency intends to make oral submissions at the hearing rather than filing a memorandum of fact and law, before the hearing it will have to disclose, by letter, the nature of those oral submissions to the other parties.\n[30] Subsection 41(4) does not impose any limits on what the Agency may address during its participation in the appeal. Nor does it say that there are no limits. Its silence on the issue of limits suggests that the power of the Court to regulate the conduct of an administrative decision-maker participating in the appeal, which pre-existed the enactment of the subsection in 1996, is unaffected. Thus, that power, described in helpful detail in Ontario Power Generation, remains available to the Court.\n[31] Subsection 41(4) does not speak to the remedial options the Court can adopt in light of the Agency\u2019s participation. Thus, the full armory of remedies available to the Court in an administrative appeal remain open to it. This includes, only in rare instances, the ability of the Court to decline to send the matter back to the Agency either because no other outcome is available to the Agency or for some other very compelling public interest reason: see paragraph 15, above.\n[32] Suppose the Agency has made submissions before the Court that, in substance or tone, go too far and cast into clear doubt its ability to decide the matter sent back to it for redetermination in a manner consistent with actual or apparent impartiality. That may be the sort of rare situation, based on very compelling public interest reasons, requiring the Court to dictate to the Agency the decision on the merits that the Agency should make.\n[33] However, one note of caution is warranted here. Some reviewing courts, sometimes even the Supreme Court, occasionally speak of making the decision on the merits of cases themselves. Some even go as far as to incorporate the decision on the merits of the cases into their formal judgment or order. This practice can be contrary to law.\n[34] Under many legislative regimes, such as the regime under the Canada Transportation Act, the administrative decision-maker, here the Agency, has the exclusive power to make decisions on the merits of individual cases under the Act. Where a legislative regime empowers only the administrative decision-maker to make decisions on the merits in individual cases, the reviewing court must obey the legislation and, thus, cannot make the order or decision on the merits itself or incorporate that decision into its formal judgment. Rather, it must send the matter back to the administrative decision-maker\u2014the body with the exclusive authority to make the decision on the merits\u2014and issue a mandamus order forcing it to make a particular decision or order on the merits.\n[35] Another remedial response to inappropriate submissions by an administrative decision-maker is a costs award: Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Canada (Transportation Agency). 2021 FCA 69; BNSF Railway Company v. Canadian Transportation Agency, 2011 FCA 269. Canadian Pacific Railway Company also affirms the point, made earlier in these reasons, that Ontario Power Generation and Northwestern Utilities apply to Agency participations in appeals.\n[36] The Agency has presented a memorandum to the Court in support of its entry into the appeal. For the reasons above, the Agency\u2019s memorandum shall be filed before the Court. In the circumstances of this case, the other parties shall not file additional memoranda responding to the Agency. They will be able to respond to the Agency\u2019s memorandum during the hearing of the appeal. For this purpose, they should be given more time for oral argument than might have otherwise been the case.\n[37] Whether the Agency has triggered the concerns in Ontario Power Generation and Northwestern Utilities and might have to react during the remedial stage of the appeal is for the panel hearing the appeal to decide. However, some observations here may be of assistance.\n[38] The main issue in the appeal is one of statutory interpretation and application. Although the Agency says it is only providing helpful information to the Court, in fact it is going further. It offers a particular view of how the statute should be interpreted.\n[39] However, one consideration perhaps lessens any concern here: the Court will decide the issues of statutory interpretation itself because the standard of review on issues of statutory interpretation in an appeal from the Agency is correctness. Thus, after the Court decides the appeal, the issue of statutory interpretation will be completely spent. All that the Agency may have to do in any redetermination is apply the Court\u2019s view of the statutory provisions to the facts before it. Provided the Agency stays away from that area in the appeal, it will remain actually and apparently impartial in any redetermination.\n[40] Therefore, the motion for directions is granted. The Registry shall accept the Agency\u2019s memorandum of fact and law for filing and the Agency may be heard at the hearing of this appeal.\n[41] The Court regrets the delay in this matter and encourages the Judicial Administrator to offer the earliest possible hearing dates for the appeal that are convenient to the parties and their counsel.\n\u201cDavid Stratas\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-267-22\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nWESTJET v.

LASKIN J.A.\nDate: 20240112\nDocket: A-156-22\nCitation: 2024 FCA 8\nCORAM:\nGLEASON J.A.\nWOODS J.A.\nLASKIN J.A.\nBETWEEN:\nKAHKEWISTAHAW FIRST NATION\nApplicant\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING IN RIGHT OF CANADA as represented by the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nGLEASON J.A.\n[1] The applicant, the Kahkewistahaw First Nation (the KFN), is a First Nation located approximately 150 kilometres east of what is now Regina, Saskatchewan. It lies between Crooked Lake and Round Lake, the two most easterly lakes in the Qu\u2019Appelle Lakes chain. In 1887, the KFN adhered to Treaty No. 4.\n[2] In 1889, the respondent, whom I refer to as simply the Crown, set aside a fishing station on Crooked Lake as a Reserve, IR 72A, for the benefit of members of the KFN, whose primary Reserve, IR 72, was landlocked. IR 72 and IR 72A were confirmed by the same Order in Council, namely, P.C. 1151, issued on May 17, 1889.\n[3] In 1944, the Crown requested that the KFN consent to a surrender of a small portion of IR 72A for a road allowance requested by a local municipality. In response, KFN members told the Indian Agent with whom they were dealing that they wished to surrender the whole of IR 72A because they preferred to fish in Round Lake, which was close to the residential school their children had attended. They contemplated using the funds from the sale of IR 72A to purchase or lease a fishing station on Round Lake. There is no indication that the option of leasing as opposed to selling the lands comprising IR 72A was canvassed by the Crown with the KFN.\n[4] In 1944, the KFN surrendered all of IR 72A to the Crown for sale \u201cupon such terms as the Government \u2026 may deem most conducive to [the welfare of KFN members]\u201d.\n[5] However, the Crown did not sell the lands that comprised IR 72A until 1956. It then sold them via three tenders to a single purchaser, who operated a resort adjacent to the reserve. In so doing, the Crown did not consult with the KFN to confirm that it was still its wish to sell the land, nor did it confirm that the manner of sale reflected what the KFN wanted.\n[6] The Crown also did not consult with the KFN about how circumstances that affected the sale had changed significantly since the surrender. More specifically, in the years between 1944 and 1956, the residential school at Round Lake had been closed and cottage lots were being sold with increasing frequency in the area.\n[7] On October 5, 2013, the KFN filed a Declaration of Claim with the Specific Claims Tribunal (the Tribunal), seeking compensation in respect of several alleged failures by the Crown to fulfil its duties owed to the KFN with respect to IR 72A and its surrender. More specifically, the KFN claimed that the Crown:\nbreached the pre-surrender fiduciary duty owed to the KFN relating to the surrender of IR 72A;\nbreached the Indian Act,1927, R.S.C. 1927, c. 98 and Treaty No. 4 in respect of the surrender of IR 72A;\nbreached the post-surrender fiduciary duty owed to the KFN in respect of the lands surrendered, including by failing to have consulted with the KFN before making the sale and by failing to pursue the more advantageous option of leasing the lands as cottage lots;\nbreached its pre and post-surrender fiduciary duties related to trespass on the lands that comprised IR 72A; and\nbreached the duty to consult in respect of the 1909 construction of a dam at Craven, Saskatchewan, which impeded water flow into Crooked Lake.\n[8] In its decision in Kahkewistahaw First Nation v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2022 SCTC 5 (the Decision), the Tribunal made the following findings:\nThe Crown did not breach its pre-surrender fiduciary duty owed to the KFN relating to the 1944 surrender of IR 72A;\nThe Crown did not breach its duty under the Indian Act, 1927 owed to the KFN relating to the 1944 surrender of IR 72A;\nThe Crown did not breach its duty under Treaty No. 4 owed to the KFN relating to the 1944 surrender of IR 72A;\nThe Crown breached its post-surrender fiduciary duty owed to the KFN, but not to the full extent claimed by the KFN. The Tribunal held, among other things, that it was not a breach of fiduciary duty for the Crown to have failed to consult with the KFN before making the final sale more than twelve years after the surrender or to have neglected to pursue the potentially more advantageous option of leasing the lands as cottage lots;\nThe Crown breached its fiduciary duty owed to the KFN with respect to a pre-surrender trespass on IR 72A;\nThe Crown owed a fiduciary duty to the KFN with respect to a post-surrender trespass on IR 72A and breached such fiduciary duty; and\nThe Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear the asserted breach of the duty to consult and accommodate with respect to the construction of the Craven Dam.\n[9] The KFN has filed an application for judicial review with this Court, seeking to set aside the Decision in part. More specifically, the KFN asks this Court to overturn the Tribunal\u2019s finding regarding a pre-surrender fiduciary duty. It submits that the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the Crown did not breach the pre-surrender fiduciary duty owed to the KFN relating to the 1944 surrender of IR 72A was unreasonable. The KFN also seeks to have us expand the basis upon which the Crown should be found to have breached its post-surrender fiduciary duty owed to the KFN. It asserts that it was unreasonable for the Tribunal to have concluded that the Crown did not breach its post\u2011surrender fiduciary duty in failing to have consulted with the KFN before making the sale and by failing to pursue the option of leasing the lands.\n[10] As is more fully discussed in the Reasons that follow, I agree with the KFN that the Tribunal committed reviewable errors in respect of its consideration of the Crown\u2019s pre and post\u2011surrender breach of fiduciary duty. Thus, I would set aside the Tribunal\u2019s decision in part, with costs, and remit to it the issues of the Crown\u2019s breach of its pre and post-surrender fiduciary duties for redetermination in accordance with these Reasons.\nI. Relevant Factual Background [11] To put these issues into context, a little more background is required. In providing this context, I set out only those facts relevant to the issues before this Court.\n[12] As noted, IR 72A, a fishing station on Crooked Lake, was set aside in 1889 as a reserve for the benefit of the KFN, whose primary reserve was landlocked. Although originally intended to be somewhat larger, IR 72A was approximately 68.5 acres in size. It comprised lands located along the shoreline of Crooked Lake and adjacent lands extending back from the shoreline.\n[13] In 1924, the Crown transferred 2.64 acres of IR 72A to the province of Saskatchewan for construction of a roadway, but did not obtain a surrender of the lands in question from the KFN nor its consent to the transfer. It also provided no compensation to the KFN for the lands transferred to the Province. In addition, another road over the reserve lands was in use prior to 1944, without the consent of the KFN. This road provided access to Sunset Beach Resort, a waterfront resort adjacent to IR 72A, operated by the Criddle family.\n[14] In 1944, following a flood of the road to Sunset Beach caused by a dam built on Crooked Lake, the municipality of Grayson, Saskatchewan approached the federal government and requested that 1.5 acres of IR 72A be transferred to it for purposes of building a new road to Sunset Beach. This time, the Crown sought the consent of the KFN to a surrender of the portion of IR 72A required for the new road.\n[15] On February 1, 1944, the General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, Mr. Christianson, wrote to Crooked Lake Indian Agent Kerley, noting the latter\u2019s comment that the Chief of the KFN was in favour of granting the requested 1.5 acres and wished to take the matter up with the Band. Mr. Christianson stated in his letter that he had been in touch with Ottawa, which would approve the surrender of the 1.5 acres if the KFN were willing to surrender the land. He asked Agent Kerley to take up the issue with the Chief and Council of the KFN, and if they were willing, to take a surrender of 1.5 acres of IR 72A. In March of 1944, Agent Kerley was sent surrender forms for a surrender of 1.5 acres of IR 72A.\n[16] In early April 1944, Agent Kerley held a meeting with some members of the KFN to discuss the surrender. There were insufficient members of the KFN present at this meeting to authorize the surrender under the provisions of the Indian Act, 1927, so a second meeting was held later that same month.\n[17] In a letter that he sent back to the Indian Affairs Branch dated April 27, 1944, Agent Kerley stated that the Band had decided unanimously at the second meeting to surrender the entire fishing station. He explained that the KFN did not use IR 72A as most of them fished in Round Lake. He added that the KFN \u201c\u2026had in mind selling IR 72A and if possible leasing or purchasing a fishing station and camp near the Round Lake School as the majority of their children attended there\u201d.\n[18] At the time, the KFN had over $200,000.00 in the capital account maintained on its behalf, which appears to have far exceeded the cost of purchasing an equivalent amount of alternate land on Round Lake.\n[19] On May 3, 1944, Agent Kerley was sent surrender forms for the surrender of the entirety of IR 72A.\n[20] On July 8, 1944, Agent Kerley sent a letter to the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, in Ottawa, enclosing the completed surrender forms and reporting that he had obtained a surrender of all of IR 72A. The surrender forms were dated July 4, 1944 and were signed by the Chief and two Principal men of the KFN, whose signatures were witnessed by other members of the KFN. The surrender document read as follows in relevant part:\n\u2026 WE, the undersigned Chief and Principal men of Kahkewistahaw Indian Band resident on our Reserve Kahkewistahaw No. 72 in the Province of Saskatchewan and Dominion of Canada, for and acting on behalf of the whole people of our said Band in Council assembled, Do hereby release, remise, surrender, quit claim and yield up unto our Sovereign Lord the King, his Heirs and Successors forever, ALL AND SINGULAR, that certain parcel or trust of land and premises, situate, lying and being in the whole of Kahkewistahaw Indian Reserve No. 72A in the \u2026 Province of Saskatchewan containing by admeasurement 68.16 acres be the same more or less\u2026\nTO HAVE AND TO HOLD the same unto His said Majesty the King, his Heirs and Successors forever, in trust to sell the same to such person or persons, and upon such terms as the Government of the Dominion of Canada may deem most conducive to our Welfare and that of our people.\nAND upon further condition that all moneys received from the sale thereof, shall be credited to Band funds.\n[21] Enclosed with Agent Kerley\u2019s July 8, 1944 letter was also the list of voters for the meeting held on July 4, 1944, shortly following which the surrender documents were signed. That list shows that 25 of 43 eligible KFN members were present for the vote and that all but two of them had voted in favour of the surrender. Also enclosed was a July 8, 1944 affidavit signed by the Chief and two Principal men of the KFN, as well as Agent Kerley. In that affidavit, they affirmed, among other things, that the surrender had been accepted by a majority of the male members of the KFN who were 21 years or older and that their assent was given at a meeting summoned for that purpose.\n[22] The Crown accepted the surrender via Order in Council P.C. 6171, issued on August 7, 1944. Its text stated that the Crown accepted the surrender of the lands that formerly comprised IR 72A \u201cin order that the said lands may be sold on such terms as may be determined most conducive to the welfare of the Indians\u201d.\n[23] Shortly after the surrender was taken, there was an exchange of correspondence between D.J. Allan, who was employed as the Superintendent Reserves and Trusts, and General Superintendent Christianson regarding the surrendered lands. This exchange reveals that both expected that the surrendered lands abutting Crooked Lake would increase in value since there would be a greater demand for cottage lots after the war ended. Both expressed the view that greater returns might be realized if the lands were subdivided and sold as cottage lots than if they were sold in a block, via public tender, which was the usual manner of selling surrendered lands. In two letters, dated September 25, 1944, and October 17, 1944, General Superintendent Christianson stated that he felt that the government could get ten times the value out of the land by subdividing it in the future, rather than by selling it whole to Mrs. Criddle for the $500 she had offered.\n[24] Superintendent Allan further noted in an October 4, 1944 letter to General Superintendent Christianson that:\nOur experience has been that should such a subdivision be decided upon it is more profitable to rent the cottage sites than to attempt an outright sale of lake frontage lots. For example, it should be an easy matter to obtain an annual rental or $10.00 a lot, while to fix a sale price on the said lots as $100.00 a piece might be considered excessive, but the results in Indian revenue would be the same.\n[25] Following the surrender, the Municipality of Grayson built a road to access the Sunset Beach Resort in 1944 that cut across the former IR 72A lands close to the beach, thereby compromising their value as potential cottage lots. The lands on which the road was situated had not yet been conveyed by the Crown to the Municipality, and a dispute arose between the federal government and the Municipality over the location of the road. After much correspondence back and forth, the Municipality agreed in 1947 to relocate the road to its original position.\n[26] By 1944, lands in the area were beginning to be leased or sold as cottage lots. Certain reserve lands of the Sakimay First Nation, also abutting Crooked Lake, were beginning to be leased as cottage lots for the benefit of that First Nation. In addition, the Criddle family had subdivided their lands at Sunset Beach and, by 1945, had sold all but six of the 24 cottage lots on their lands. In subsequent years, cottage lots were surveyed and sold with increasing frequency in the area.\n[27] It appears that nothing was done by the Crown to further the sale of the surrendered former IR 72A lands between 1944 and 1953. No documentation was found relating to the sale of the lands over that period.\n[28] In July 1953, an individual acting on behalf of Mr. Criddle expressed an interest in purchasing the lands. On July 8, 1953, L.L. Brown, the new Superintendent, Reserves and Trusts, wrote to J.B.P. Ostrander, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, noting that he had received an inquiry from a friend of Mr. Criddle about purchasing the lands. Superintendent Brown thought the lands had not yet been surrendered and inquired if a surrender could be arranged.\n[29] In his reply letter of July 17, 1953, Regional Supervisor Ostrander stated that he had spoken to Agent Kerley, who was under the impression that the lands had already been surrendered. Regional Supervisor Ostrander also expressed the view that the lands should be offered for sale via public tender, as opposed to being sold privately to Mr. Criddle, as the tender process might lead to a higher price. He also wrote that he was of the view that the land should not be subdivided because this would cause delay, and the difference in the amount that the sale following subdivision might realize \u201cwould not be worth the trouble and expense\u201d.\n[30] Superintendent Brown replied on August 6, 1953 and confirmed that the lands had been surrendered. He stated as follows in his letter:\nWe now find that this Reserve was surrendered for sale in July, 1944, and the surrender was accepted by Order in Council P.C. 6171 dated August 4th, 1944. We are therefore in a position to proceed with the proposed sale without further reference to the Band.\n[31] The lands to be sold were subsequently surveyed at the request of the Crown and found to comprise approximately 65 acres. The lands were appraised in 1955 by the Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs as having a value of $1,920.00. At the direction of the Honourable J.W. Pickersgill, the then Minister, Department of Citizenship and Immigration, the lands were divided into three lots and offered for sale by public tender on November 2, 1955. The call for tenders expressly reserved the mine and mineral rights. Three offers were received; the highest was from Mr. Criddle, who offered $2,500.00 for all three parcels. His offer was accepted and a patent was issued to Mr. Criddle in June of 1956 for 64.36 acres of what was formerly IR 72A.\n[32] The KFN was not consulted about the manner of disposition of the lands, save to obtain its concurrence to bearing the costs for advertising the sale. Nor was it asked whether it still desired that the lands be sold.\n[33] By Band Council Resolution dated October 11, 1955, the KFN resolved that the costs for advertising the sale of the lands were to be paid from the revenue account of the Band.\n[34] Sometime between 1944 and 1954, the Round Lake Residential School closed. On September 21, 1954, by Band Council Resolution, the KFN decided to buy the former Round Lake Residential School lands for $10,000.00, resolving to lease these lands until they were needed by the KFN for farming purposes. These lands were purchased by the Crown on behalf of the KFN, and were added to IR 72 by Order in Council, dated November 10, 1960.\n[35] The experts who testified before the Tribunal on behalf of the KFN and the Crown agreed that the highest and best use of the portion of the lands that formerly comprised IR 72A contiguous to the shoreline would have been as a cottage lot subdivision, which would have yielded 42 waterfront lots. They further agreed that the highest and best use of the backlands would have been for agricultural purposes. They also agreed that, had the lands been leased for the benefit of the KFN, the revenue from leasing the lands between 1945 and 2018 would have been equivalent to nearly 4 million dollars in 2018.\nII. The Decision [36] I turn next to review the portions of the Decision relevant to the issues before this Court.\n[37] As concerns the alleged breach of pre-surrender fiduciary duties, the Tribunal focussed its discussion on whether the KFN\u2019s understanding of the terms of surrender was adequate and whether its decision to surrender the entirety of IR 72A was so foolish or improvident as to constitute exploitation.\n[38] The Tribunal commenced its discussion of these issues by quoting from the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in Southwind v. Canada, 2021 SCC 28, 459 D.L.R. (4th) 1 [Southwind] and Blueberry River Indian Band v. Canada (Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 344, 1995 CanLII 50 (SCC). The Tribunal then noted that it was required \u201c\u2026to strike [a] balance between the two pillars of autonomy and protection\u201d (at para. 47). It continued by stating that the KFN had the right to surrender the land and that its decision to do so was to be respected \u201c\u2026unless [its] understanding of the terms of surrender was inadequate or the decision to surrender IR 72A was so foolish or improvident that it constituted exploitation\u201d (at para. 47).\n[39] The Tribunal then moved to assess the adequacy of the KFN\u2019s understanding of the terms of surrender and concluded that the evidence did not support a conclusion that such understanding was inadequate. The Tribunal noted that the surrender documents were signed by the Chief and five members of the Band and clearly set out the nature of the surrender, stating that the lands were being surrendered for sale. Based largely on this fact and the fact that the impetus for the surrender of the whole of IR 72A came from the KFN, the Tribunal concluded that the KFN\u2019s understanding of the terms of surrender was not inadequate.\n[40] In terms of the contrary arguments advanced by the KFN, the Tribunal gave little weight to the fact that certain members of the KFN continued to fish in Crooked Lake after 1944 or to the fact that the KFN had adequate funds in the capital account to purchase those lands it wished to purchase on Round Lake. The Tribunal inferred that the Chief and Council would have been aware of the amount in the capital account. The Tribunal thus concluded that the amount of the funds on deposit in that account did not evidence an inadequate understanding of the terms of surrender, which were plainly set out in the documents that were signed by the Chief and members of the KFN.\n[41] The Tribunal also gave little weight to the opinions of Superintendent Allan and General Superintendent Christianson, set out in their letters regarding the most profitable way of proceeding, holding that their letters \u201c\u2026 speak only to their opinions at the time of writing and not an inadequate understanding by the [KFN] of the terms of the surrender\u201d (at para. 48).\n[42] Despite concluding that the evidence did not demonstrate an inadequate understanding by the members of the KFN of the terms of surrender, the Tribunal was critical of the Crown\u2019s conduct in taking the surrender. It wrote as follows at paragraph 49 of the Decision:\nStill, it is difficult to consider the facts surrounding the pre-surrender without concluding that the Crown could have better guided Kahkewistahaw when they decided that they wished to sell all of IR 72A. It could have investigated the land around Round Lake to determine availability and cost and inform Kahkewistahaw of its findings, considering the money in Kahkewistahaw\u2019s capital account. The Crown ultimately did not offer Kahkewistahaw lands on Round Lake to purchase until 1953 and the purchase price was a small fraction of the amount in their capital account at the time of surrender. The Crown could have informed and discussed leasing with the Claimant as an alternative to selling the land, pre-surrender. The Crown\u2019s pre-surrender fiduciary obligation, however, is one of \u201cordinary diligence\u201d to avoid an exploitative bargain.\n[43] After discussing the adequacy of the KFN\u2019s understanding of the terms of surrender, the Tribunal assessed whether its terms were foolish or improvident. The Tribunal compared the situation to that in Blueberry River and Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada, 2002 SCC 79, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 245 [Wewaykum], where the First Nations involved were found to have possessed good reasons for decisions they made: see Decision at paras. 49-50. The Tribunal reasoned that the KFN also had similar reasons in the case at bar, which were \u201c\u2026 grounded in reflection evidenced by a clear explanation why land near Round Lake would be more suitable to the members\u201d: see para. 51. It therefore held that the surrender was not so foolish or improvident as to constitute exploitation.\n[44] The Tribunal concluded as follows concerning the alleged pre-surrender breach of fiduciary duty: \u201c[w]hile the Crown could have communicated further details to the [KFN] at the time they expressed their desire to sell IR 72A, its failure to do so falls short of breaching its pre-surrender fiduciary obligation to avoid an unconscionable bargain\u201d: see para. 51.\n[45] Turning to the claimed post-surrender breach of fiduciary duty, the Crown conceded that the delay in selling the surrendered lands between 1948 and 1953, during which there was no movement to sell the lands, amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty: Decision at para. 101. The Tribunal also held that the Crown breached its fiduciary duty over the period from 1944 to 1947 by failing to exercise reasonable diligence to source revenue for the surrendered lands or to make an effort to sell them: Decision at para. 106. The Tribunal further held that the Crown breached its post-surrender fiduciary duty by failing to assess whether it would have been more profitable to subdivide the lands before the sale, particularly as there was a steady sale of cottage lots in the area between 1959 and 1967: see Decision at para. 111.\n[46] However, the Tribunal held that the Crown had no duty to consider leasing the lands on behalf of the KFN because the terms of surrender provided that the lands were surrendered for sale: see Decision at para. 107.\n[47] The Tribunal also held that the Crown did not breach its duty to consult the KFN about the sale before the lands were eventually sold, because delay, in and of itself, does not give rise to such a duty: see Decision at para. 113.\nIII. Analysis\n[48] I turn now to address the arguments the KFN advanced before this Court.\nA. Standard of Review [49] I commence by noting that the standard of review that we are to apply to the Decision is the deferential standard of reasonableness, as was held in by the Supreme Court of Canada in Williams Lake Indian Band v. Canada (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development), 2018 SCC 4, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 83 at para. 27 [Williams Lake 2018 SCC] and by this Court in Williams Lake First Nation v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 2021 FCA 30 [Williams Lake 2021 FCA], 458 D.L.R. (4th) 722 at para. 33; Witchekan Lake First Nation v. Canada, 2022 FCA 52, 2022 CarswellNat 7119 at para. 2; and Ahousaht First Nation v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 2021 FCA 135, 342 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 39847 (3 March 2022) at paras. 44-45 [Ahousaht].\n[50] In Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, 2019 SCC 65 (CanLII) [Vavilov], a majority of the Supreme Court underscored that a decision of an administrative decision-maker may be unreasonable either because of a failure of rationality in its reasoning process, where it gives reasons, or because the decision is untenable in light of the factual and legal constraints that bear on it: Vavilov, at para. 101.\n[51] As concerns the second possibility, the majority noted that the requisite inquiry is contextual. The Court provided a non-exhaustive list of contextual factors that may constrain an administrative decision maker. Those include the relevant common law precedents, precedents from the administrative decision maker, itself, and the evidence before the decision-maker.\n[52] With respect to common law precedents from the courts, the majority held that, provided adequate explanations are given, an administrative decision-maker may sometimes decline to follow a decision from the courts, depending on the circumstances. More specifically, at paragraphs 112-113 of Vavilov, the majority stated:\nAny precedents on the issue before the administrative decision maker or on a similar issue will act as a constraint on what the decision maker can reasonably decide. An administrative body\u2019s decision may be unreasonable on the basis that the body failed to explain or justify a departure from a binding precedent in which the same provision had been interpreted. Where, for example, there is a relevant case in which a court considered a statutory provision, it would be unreasonable for an administrative decision maker to interpret or apply the provision without regard to that precedent. The decision maker would have to be able to explain why a different interpretation is preferable by, for example, explaining why the court\u2019s interpretation does not work in the administrative context: M. Biddulph, \u201cRethinking the Ramification of Reasonableness Review: Stare Decisis and Reasonableness Review on Questions of Law\u201d (2018), 56 Alta. L.R. 119, at p. 146. There may be circumstances in which it is quite simply unreasonable for an administrative decision maker to fail to apply or interpret a statutory provision in accordance with a binding precedent. For instance, where an immigration tribunal is required to determine whether an applicant\u2019s act would constitute a criminal offence under Canadian law (see, e.g., Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, ss.35-37), it would clearly not be reasonable for the tribunal to adopt an interpretation of a criminal law provision that is inconsistent with how Canadian criminal courts have interpreted it.\nThat being said, administrative decision makers will not necessarily be required to apply equitable and common law principles in the same manner as courts in order for their decisions to be reasonable. For example, it may be reasonable for a decision maker to adapt a common law or equitable doctrine to its administrative context: see Nor-Man Regional Health Authority, at paras. 5-6, 44-45, 52, 54 and 60. Conversely, a decision maker that rigidly applies a common law doctrine without adapting it to the relevant administrative context may be acting unreasonably: see Delta Air Lines, at paras. 16-17 and 30. In short, whether an administrative decision maker has acted reasonably in adapting a legal or equitable doctrine involves a highly context-specific determination.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[53] With respect to a decision maker\u2019s own prior decisions, Vavilov recognizes that decision makers may enjoy greater latitude in departing from their own prior decisions, given the absence of stare decisis, but nonetheless must still provide adequate reasons for declining to follow the decision maker\u2019s own case law. As the majority stated at paragraphs 129 and 131:\nAdministrative decision makers are not bound by their previous decisions in the same sense that courts are bound by stare decisis. As this Court noted in Domtar, \u201ca lack of unanimity is the price to pay for the decision\u2011making freedom and independence\u201d given to administrative decision makers, and the mere fact that some conflict exists among an administrative body\u2019s decisions does not threaten the rule of law: p. 800. Nevertheless, administrative decision makers and reviewing courts alike must be concerned with the general consistency of administrative decisions. Those affected by administrative decisions are entitled to expect that like cases will generally be treated alike and that outcomes will not depend merely on the identity of the individual decision maker \u2014 expectations that do not evaporate simply because the parties are not before a judge.\n[\u2026]\nWhether a particular decision is consistent with the administrative body\u2019s past decisions is also a constraint that the reviewing court should consider when determining whether an administrative decision is reasonable. Where a decision maker does depart from longstanding practices or established internal authority, it bears the justificatory burden of explaining that departure in its reasons. If the decision maker does not satisfy this burden, the decision will be unreasonable. In this sense, the legitimate expectations of the parties help to determine both whether reasons are required and what those reasons must explain: Baker, at para. 26. We repeat that this does not mean administrative decision makers are bound by internal precedent in the same manner as courts. Rather, it means that a decision that departs from longstanding practices or established internal decisions will be reasonable if that departure is justified, thereby reducing the risk of arbitrariness, which would undermine public confidence in administrative decision makers and in the justice system as a whole.\n[54] As concerns the constraints imposed by the evidence before the decision maker, the majority found that it is axiomatic that a reviewing court may not second guess the factual findings of an administrative decision maker or re-weigh the evidence before the administrative decision maker. That said, the majority also recognized that a decision must nonetheless be justified in terms of the facts that were before the decision maker. More specifically, at paragraphs 125-126 of Vavilov, the majority found:\nIt is trite law that the decision maker may assess and evaluate the evidence before it and that, absent exceptional circumstances, a reviewing court will not interfere with its factual findings. The reviewing court must refrain from \u201creweighing and reassessing the evidence considered by the decision maker\u201d: CHRC, at para. 55; see also Khosa, at para. 64; Dr. Q, at paras. 41-42. Indeed, many of the same reasons that support an appellate court\u2019s deferring to a lower court\u2019s factual findings, including the need for judicial efficiency, the importance of preserving certainty and public confidence, and the relatively advantageous position of the first instance decision maker, apply equally in the context of judicial review: see Housen, at paras. 15-18; Dr. Q, at para. 38; Dunsmuir, at para. 53.\nThat being said, a reasonable decision is one that is justified in light of the facts: Dunsmuir, at para. 47. The decision maker must take the evidentiary record and the general factual matrix that bears on its decision into account, and its decision must be reasonable in light of them: see Southam, at para. 56. The reasonableness of a decision may be jeopardized where the decision maker has fundamentally misapprehended or failed to account for the evidence before it. In Baker, for example, the decision maker had relied on irrelevant stereotypes and failed to consider relevant evidence, which led to a conclusion that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias: para. 48. Moreover, the decision maker\u2019s approach would also have supported a finding that the decision was unreasonable on the basis that the decision maker showed that his conclusions were not based on the evidence that was actually before him: ibid.\n[55] In judicial review applications before the Federal Courts, paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-7 sets out the sets out both the grounds of review and the parameters of what reasonableness requires for review of factual errors: see Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa, 2009 SCC 12, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 339 at para. 46; Canada (Attorney General) v. Best Buy Canada Ltd., 2021 FCA 161, [2021] F.C.J. No. 848 (QL) at para. 103 [Best Buy].\n[56] Paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act uses terms very similar to those used by the Supreme Court of Canada in Vavilov to define unreasonable factual errors. Paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act provides that factual findings made by a federal administrative decision maker are subject to being set aside only if the decision maker has \u201cbased its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it.\u201d\n[57] As noted in Best Buy at paragraph 123 and Walls v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 47, [2022] F.C.J. No 399 (QL) at paragraph 41, this Court has held that the notion of perversity has been interpreted as wilfully going contrary to evidence, whereas the notions of capriciousness and factual findings being made without regard to the evidence include circumstances where there was no evidence to rationally support a finding or where the decision maker failed to reasonably account at all for critical evidence that ran counter to its findings (see also Page v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 169, 483 D.L.R. (4th) 742 at para. 79 and Brown v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 104, 2022 A.C.W.S. 2040 at para. 22).\n[58] While the test for setting aside a decision due to an unreasonable factual finding is an exacting one, reviewable factual errors do occur, and have, for example, resulted in decisions being set aside by this Court in Williams Lake 2021 FCA (an application for judicial review of a Tribunal decision); Canada (Attorney General) v. Fauteux, 2020 FCA 165, 329 A.C.W.S. (3d) 231; and Bergey v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 FCA 30, [2017] F.C.J. No. 142.\nB. Is the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Pre-surrender and Post-Surrender Fiduciary Duty Unreasonable? [59] With this general background regarding reasonableness review in mind, I move on now to assess whether the Tribunal\u2019s treatment of the Crown\u2019s fiduciary obligations was reasonable. Having already reviewed the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on this issue, it is useful to next discuss the applicable common law precedents.\n(1) Precedents from the Courts [60] In Williams Lake 2018 SCC, the Supreme Court of Canada explained that there are two different ways in which a fiduciary obligation may arise between the Crown and Indigenous peoples. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Wagner stated as follows at paragraph 44:\nA fiduciary obligation may arise from the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples in two ways. First, it may arise from the Crown\u2019s discretionary control over a specific or cognizable Aboriginal interest: Manitoba Metis Federation, at paras. 49 and 51; Wewaykum, at paras. 79-83; Haida Nation, at para. 18; T.R., at para. 180-81. Because this obligation is specific to the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples, it has been characterized as a \u201csui generis\u201d fiduciary obligation: Wewaykum, at para. 78; Guerin, at p. 385; Sparrow, at p. 1108. Second, a fiduciary obligation may arise where the general conditions for a private law ad hoc fiduciary relationship are satisfied \u2014 that is, where the Crown has undertaken to exercise its discretionary control over a legal or substantial practical interest in the best interests of the alleged beneficiary: Manitoba Metis Federation, at para. 50; Alberta v. Elder Advocates of Alberta Society, 2011 SCC 24, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 261, at para. 36; T.R., at paras. 182 and 217.\n[61] As noted in Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 623 at paragraph 50 and Alberta v. Elder Advocates of Alberta Society, 2011 SCC 24, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 261 [Elder Advocates], at paragraph 36, a private law ad hoc fiduciary relationship requires that the following conditions be met:\n(1) an undertaking by the alleged fiduciary to act in the best interests of the alleged beneficiary or beneficiaries; (2) a defined person or class of persons vulnerable to a fiduciary\u2019s control (the beneficiary or beneficiaries); and (3) a legal or substantial practical interest of the beneficiary or beneficiaries that stands to be adversely affected by the alleged fiduciary\u2019s exercise of discretion or control.\n[62] The duties cast upon an ad hoc fiduciary are those of utmost loyalty and good faith, requiring the fiduciary to act in the best interests of the beneficiary and no other: see Elder Advocates at para. 43, citing Timothy G. Youdan, ed., Equity, Fiduciaries and Trusts (Royal Society of Canada, 1989) at p. 27; Williams Lake 2018 SCC at para. 165 (Brown J.\u2019s dissenting reasons). Given their multifaceted obligations and responsibilities, as was noted at para. 37 of Elder Advocates, governments will not owe private law duties of an ad hoc fiduciary in many circumstances.\n[63] The sui generis fiduciary duty owed to Indigenous people, on the other hand, has been held to exist whenever the Crown has discretionary control over a cognizable Aboriginal interest, and particularly with respect to the surrender and expropriation of reserve lands.\n[64] The sui generis fiduciary duty owed to Indigenous peoples in respect of surrendered reserve lands was first recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in Guerin v. The Queen, 1984 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335; Jack Woodward, Aboriginal Law in Canada (Proview) at \u00a7 3:57 at paras. 3.1300, 3.1310; Leonard I. Rotman \u201cConceptualizing Crown-Aboriginal Fiduciary Relations,\u201d in Law Commission of Canada, In Whom We Trust: A Forum on Fiduciary Relationships (Toronto: Irwin, 2002) at 26. There, the Court found that the Crown breached its fiduciary duty to the Band when it leased surrendered reserve lands on less favourable terms than were discussed with the Band and failed to disclose its inability to have the lessee agree to the terms discussed with the Band. Rather than proceeding to sign the lease, the Supreme Court held that the Crown ought to have instead disclosed to the Band its inability to obtain the terms discussed with the Band and should have sought new instructions before signing a lease. Even though the terms in issue were only discussed orally and were not incorporated into the terms of the surrender, the Court held that the Crown could not rely on the written terms contained in the formal surrender document. Writing for the majority in Guerin, Dickson J. (as he then was) stated at pp. 388-389:\nNonetheless, the Crown, in my view, was not empowered by the surrender document to ignore the oral terms which the Band understood would be embodied in the lease. The oral representations form the backdrop against which the Crown's conduct in discharging its fiduciary obligation must be measured. They inform and confine the field of discretion within which the Crown was free to act. After the Crown's agents had induced the Band to surrender its land on the understanding that the land would be leased on certain terms, it would be unconscionable to permit the Crown simply to ignore those terms. When the promised lease proved impossible to obtain, the Crown, instead of proceeding to lease the land on different, unfavourable terms, should have returned to the Band to explain what had occurred and seek the Band's counsel on how to proceed. The existence of such unconscionability is the key to a conclusion that the Crown breached its fiduciary duty. Equity will not countenance unconscionable behaviour in a fiduciary, whose duty is that of utmost loyalty to his principal.\n[65] In Blueberry River, the Band surrendered its mineral rights and reserve lands to the Crown to use the funds obtained to purchase alternate lands closer to its hunting grounds. The terms of the surrender for the mineral rights were for them to be leased and the terms of the surrender of the lands were for lease or sale. The Court found no breach of fiduciary duty in respect of the surrender because its terms were fully discussed and understood by the Band. Importantly, the option of leasing was shown to have been fully discussed with the Band. However, the Court went on to find a breach of fiduciary duty in respect of the Crown\u2019s failure to reserve the mineral rights in the eventual sale in circumstances where the Crown\u2019s usual practice was to reserve the mineral rights in all sales of Crown lands.\n[66] On the issue of the surrender, in her oft-cited concurring reasons, McLachlin J. (as she then was) noted that, while the Band had trusted the Crown to provide it with information as to its options and their foreseeable consequences, the Band had not abdicated its decision making power in respect of the surrender. In the circumstances, the Court found that the scope of the fiduciary duty owed by the Crown in respect of the surrender was limited to preventing an exploitative bargain as opposed to preventing the sale. The Band had argued that the Crown had an obligation to prevent the surrender in circumstances where, with the decline of hunting and trapping and the subsequent discovery of oil and gas on the former reserve, hindsight showed the decision to surrender to have been unfortunate. The Court rejected this contention. McLachlin J. noted at paragraph 35:\nMy view is that the Indian Act's provisions for surrender of band reserves strikes a balance between the two extremes of autonomy and protection. The band's consent was required to surrender its reserve. Without that consent the reserve could not be sold. But the Crown, through the Governor in Council, was also required to consent to the surrender. The purpose of the requirement of Crown consent was not to substitute the Crown's decision for that of the band, but to prevent exploitation. As Dickson J. characterized it in Guerin (at p. 383):\nThe purpose of this surrender requirement is clearly to interpose the Crown between the Indians and prospective purchasers or lessees of their land, so as to prevent the Indians from being exploited.\nIt follows that under the Indian Act, the Band had the right to decide whether to surrender the reserve, and its decision was to be respected. At the same time, if the Band's decision was foolish or improvident -- a decision that constituted exploitation -- the Crown could refuse to consent. In short, the Crown's obligation was limited to preventing exploitative bargains.\n[67] Gonthier J., who penned the majority reasons, noted that he would have been \u201creluctant to give effect\u201d to the surrender if he thought that the \u201cBand\u2019s understanding of its terms had been inadequate, or if the conduct of the Crown had somehow tainted the dealings in a manner which made it unsafe to rely on the Band\u2019s understanding and intention\u201d (at para. 14).\n[68] The failure to reserve the mineral rights, on the other hand, was found to be a breach of fiduciary duty because the Crown failed to exercise ordinary prudence when, through mistake, it neglected to follow its usual practice of reserving the mineral rights from the sale. In the words of McLachlin J. at paragraph 104:\nThe matter comes down to this. The duty on the Crown as fiduciary was \"that of a man of ordinary prudence in managing his own affairs\": Fales v. The Crown Permanent Trust Co., 1976 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1977] 2 S.C.R. 302, at p. 315. A reasonable person does not inadvertently give away a potentially valuable asset which has already demonstrated earning potential. Nor does a reasonable person give away for no consideration what it will cost him nothing to keep and which may one day possess value, however remote the possibility. The Crown managing its own affairs reserved out its minerals. It should have done the same for the Band.\n[69] Wewaykum also concerned reserve lands. There, the Supreme Court of Canada clarified that a fiduciary duty does not cover all aspects of the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples and does not necessarily arise before reserve creation: see para. 81. The Court held that, depending on the circumstances, a fiduciary relationship can arise prior to reserve creation, where its scope is limited to the obligations of good faith, providing full disclosure with respect to the subject matter, and acting with ordinary prudence. However, after a reserve is created, the scope of the Crown\u2019s obligations are expanded to include protection of Indigenous interests in reserve land from exploitative bargains: see paras. 98-99.\n[70] In Williams Lake 2018 SCC, Chief Justice Wagner, writing for a majority of the Supreme Court, described the scope of the sui generis fiduciary duty owed to Indigenous peoples, as developed through the case law, in the following terms at paragraph 46:\nA fiduciary obligation requires that the Crown\u2019s discretionary control be exercised in accordance with the standard of conduct to which equity holds a fiduciary (Guerin, at p. 384; Wewaykum, at para. 80). This is embodied, for example, in the fiduciary duties of loyalty, good faith and full disclosure. The standard of care to which a fiduciary is held in its pursuit of the beneficiary\u2019s interests is \u201cthat of a man of ordinary prudence in managing his own affairs\u201d: Blueberry River Indian Band v. Canada (Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 1995 CanLII 50 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 344, at para. 104 (McLachlin J., as she then was), citing Fales v. Canada Permanent Trust Co., 1976 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1977] 2 S.C.R. 302, at p. 315; Wewaykum, at para. 94.\n[71] In Southwind, the most recent decision of the Supreme Court concerning fiduciary duties owed to Indigenous peoples, Karakatsanis J., writing for the majority, described the nature of the ad hoc fiduciary duty owed by the Crown to Indigenous peoples with respect to reserve lands as follows at paragraphs 63-64:\nIn a case involving reserve land, the sui generis nature of the interest in reserve land informs the fiduciary duty. Reserve land is not a fungible commodity. Instead, reserve land reflects the essential relationship between Indigenous Peoples and the land. In Osoyoos, Iacobucci J. wrote that Aboriginal interests in land has an \u201cimportant cultural component that reflects the relationship between an aboriginal community and the land and the inherent and unique value in the land itself which is enjoyed by the community\u201d (para. 46). The importance of the interest in reserve land is heightened by the fact that, in many cases such as this one, the reserve land was set aside as part of an obligation that arose out of treaties between the Crown and Indigenous Peoples.\nThe fiduciary duty imposes the following obligations on the Crown: loyalty, good faith, full disclosure, and, where reserve land is involved, the protection and preservation of the First Nation\u2019s quasi-proprietary interest from exploitation (Williams Lake, at para. 46; Wewaykum, at para. 86). The standard of care is that of a person of ordinary prudence in managing their own affairs (Williams Lake, at para. 46). In the context of a surrender of reserve land, this Court has recognized that the duty also requires that the Crown protect against improvident bargains, manage the process to advance the best interests of the First Nation, and ensure that it consents to the surrender (Blueberry River Indian Band v. Canada (Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 1995 CanLII 50 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 344, at paras. 35 and 96). In an expropriation, the obligation to ensure consent is replaced by an obligation to minimally impair the protected interest (Osoyoos, at para. 54).\n[Emphasis added.]\n[72] In Southwind, the Supreme Court also underscored that a breaching fiduciary who fails to disclose material facts is prevented by what has been called the \u201cBrickenden rule\u201d from arguing that the outcome would have been the same regardless of whether the facts were disclosed, citing to Brickenden v. London Loan & Savings Co. [1934] 3 D.L.R. 465 (P.C.), 1934 CanLII 280 (UK JCPC) (at para. 82).\n[73] One other court decision merits mention, namely, the decision of our Court in Semiahmoo Indian Band v. Canada (C.A.), 148 D.L.R. (4th) 523, 1997 CanLII 6347 (FCA) [Semiahmoo]. There, this Court found a breach of fiduciary duty when the Crown requested the surrender of land to expand a customs facility without any definite plans to construct the facility. This Court upheld the trial judge\u2019s finding that the initial surrender as well as a failure to re-convey the land when the Band requested a re-conveyance were both breaches of fiduciary duty by the Crown. Importantly for our purposes, this Court confirmed that the Crown\u2019s post-surrender fiduciary obligations required it to consider and adjust to changed circumstances, which in that case, involved a request by the Band that the land be re-conveyed back to Band when it was no longer needed for the purposes it was surrendered.\n[74] From the foregoing cases, the following principles emerge of relevance to the instant case.\n[75] First, the nature of the sui generis fiduciary duty owed by the Crown to Indigenous peoples in the context of a surrender of reserve land is multifaceted. The obligations imposed on the Crown in such circumstances include duties of loyalty, good faith, full disclosure, protection of the First Nation\u2019s interest in the reserve lands from exploitative or improvident bargains, managing the process in the best interests of the First Nation, and ensuring that the First Nation consents to the surrender. These duties require decision makers tasked with assessing a claim of breach of fiduciary duty to consider factors that go well beyond the existence of consent by the First Nation and whether the bargain was improvident, the only two factors assessed by the Tribunal in the present case.\n[76] Second, the terms of the formal written surrender document are not determinative of the scope of the Crown\u2019s fiduciary obligations. Rather, the nature of those obligations will fall to be determined based on all the relevant surrounding circumstances. Sometimes those circumstances may require the Crown, in the discharge of its fiduciary obligations, to go beyond the terms contained in the surrender document and to explore other options.\n[77] Third, the Crown\u2019s post-surrender fiduciary obligations may require it to consider and adjust to changed circumstances relevant to the surrender where the surrendered land has not yet been sold. Depending on the facts, the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duties may require it to consult with the First Nation or re-convey to the First Nation lands that have been surrendered and not yet sold.\n(2) Precedents from the Tribunal [78] I turn next to briefly review relevant precedents from the Tribunal, itself.\n[79] The Tribunal has recognized many times that the obligations imposed on the Crown when reserve land is surrendered go beyond preventing exploitative bargains and accepting a surrender that the First Nation has consented to sign. These additional obligations include, among other things, the need for full disclosure to the First Nation by the Crown of all relevant facts that the Crown has knowledge of prior to taking the surrender: see e.g. Metlakatla Indian Band v. His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, 2022 SCTC 6 at paras. 186-189, 194 [Metlakatla]; Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2019 SCTC 5 at para. 144 [Makwa Sahgaiehcan]; Lac La Ronge Band and Montreal Lake Cree Nation v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2014 SCTC 8, aff\u2019d 2015 FCA 154 at para. 164.\n[80] In all of the foregoing cases, the Tribunal found the Crown breached the fiduciary duty it owed to Indigenous Peoples, in part because it failed to disclose or consult on facts the Crown had knowledge of that were relevant to the decision to surrender. As the Tribunal noted in Metlakatla, \u201cthe failure by Canada to offer disclosure of material facts to [a] Band\u201d is \u201ca failure to act with loyalty and good faith towards [that] Band\u201d: see para. 340.\n[81] Where there is a failure to disclose relevant facts, any consent given to the surrender is not an informed one, and therefore cannot be valid. This is because \u201cwhere actions are a matter of choice, the exercise of an actor\u2019s autonomous will depend on the actor\u2019s knowledge of the available choices\u201d: Makwa Sahgaiehcan, at para. 149.\n[82] Where appropriate disclosure has not been made, the Tribunal has held that the burden falls on the Crown to establish that the First Nation would have suffered the same loss regardless of the breach. In in Doig River First Nation and Blueberry River First Nations v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada 2018, SCTC 5, the Tribunal outlined the applicable principles as follows:\n[161] \u2026.Where the breach of duty includes a failure to inform the beneficiary about important aspects of the impugned transaction, the principle in Brickenden, as interpreted in Hodgkinson, applies. The Court in Brickenden at page 469 said:\nWhen a party, holding a fiduciary relationship, commits a breach of his duty by non-disclosure of material facts, which his constituent is entitled to know in connection with the transaction, he cannot be heard to maintain that disclosure would not have altered the decision to proceed with the transaction, because the constitutent\u2019s [sic] action would be solely determined by some other factor, such as the valuation by another party of the property proposed to be mortgaged. Once the Court has determined that the non-disclosure facts were material, speculation as to what course the constituent, on disclosure, would have taken is not relevant.\n[162] In Hodgkinson, the Supreme Court of Canada framed the principle in Brickenden as a reverse onus: \u201c\u2026the onus is on the defendant to prove that the innocent victim would have suffered the same loss regardless of the breach\u2026\u201d; the defendant must provide \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d; and, \u201cmere \u2018speculation\u2019\u201d is inadequate (Hodgkinson at para 76). The focus of the inquiry then is whether the ill-informed \u201cconstituent\u201d would have continued with the deal if properly informed.\n[83] The Tribunal has also found that where there is a change in circumstances relevant to a decision to surrender or to the sale of resources harvested from reserve lands, the Crown must consult with the First Nation before proceeding: see especially Doig River First Nation and Blueberry River First Nations v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2015 SCTC 6 at paras. 155, 168 [Doig River 2015]; Huu-Ay-Aht First Nations v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2014 SCTC 7 at paras. 72, 86-87, 104 [Huu-Ay-Aht].\n[84] As will soon become apparent, it is my view that the Tribunal\u2019s failure to recognize the foregoing principles drawn from the relevant court and Tribunal cases renders its decision in the case at bar unreasonable.\n(3) Reasonableness of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Pre-surrender Breach of Fiduciary Duty [85] I turn first to review in more detail the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the allegations of pre-surrender breach and find that it reached an unreasonable factual conclusion. This, in turn, led it to bypass consideration of the adequacy of the information the KFN had when it consented to the surrender of IR 72A and of the adequacy of disclosure made by the Crown to the KFN.\n[86] In this regard, it will be recalled that the Tribunal characterized what was said by two government officials in correspondence between them about the value of the surrendered lands as being merely the views of two individuals, which bore no relevance to the adequacy of the KFN\u2019s understanding of the terms of surrender. With respect, this characterization is so untenable that it meets the high bar of being unreasonable because it fails to reasonably account for critical evidence that runs counter to its findings. In the words used by the Supreme Court in Vavilov, the Tribunal fundamentally misapprehended the evidence before it.\n[87] Superintendent Allan and General Superintendent Christianson were not mere individuals, but, rather, were key officials employed in the very federal government department that was charged with responsibility for protecting the interests of Indigenous Peoples in Saskatchewan in their reserve lands. Moreover, in his October 4, 1944 letter to General Superintendent Christianson, Superintendent Allan stated that it had been \u201cour\u201d experience that leasing cottage lots was more profitable than selling them. His use of the pronoun \u201cour\u201d can only be understood as meaning that he was speaking of the collective experience of officials in the Department and not just his own experience. The timing of the letter is also significant. It was sent just months after the surrender was taken.\n[88] The knowledge of individuals acting for the Crown in these key roles that it was more profitable at the time to lease than sell lots that could be used for building cottages is highly relevant to the adequacy of the KFN\u2019s understanding of the terms of the surrender and to the adequacy of the Crown\u2019s disclosure to the KFN.\n[89] There is no suggestion that the Crown discussed the relative merits of leasing versus selling the IR 72A lands with the KFN before the surrender was taken by Agent Kerley. In the absence of any discussion by the Crown with the KFN of the comparative value of leasing versus sale of the IR 72A lands, it is impossible to conclude that the KFN had an adequate understanding of the terms of the surrender or that appropriate disclosure was made by the Crown.\n[90] As the applicant rightly notes, the lack of evidence that these facts were discussed with the KFN distinguishes this case from Blueberry River and reduces the requirement for an adequate understanding of the terms of the surrender to \u201clittle more than a question of whether the First Nation members were literate\u201d: see Applicant\u2019s Memorandum of Fact and Law at para. 46.\n[91] I therefore conclude that the unreasonable characterization of the correspondence between Superintendent Allan and General Superintendent Christianson led the Tribunal to commit a reviewable error.\n[92] In addition to the foregoing unreasonable factual determination, the Tribunal also failed to account for or to reconcile its decision in the present case with the long line of authority from the courts and the Tribunal, itself, holding that the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duties in cases of this nature include the requirement for full disclosure. The conclusions of the Tribunal in paragraphs 49 and 51 of the Decision, regarding the additional disclosures that could have been made by the Crown about the potential benefits of leasing, are incompatible with the authorities that require full disclosure by the Crown of relevant information when a surrender is taken.\n[93] I therefore conclude that the Tribunal\u2019s determination that there was no pre-surrender breach of fiduciary duty by the Crown was unreasonable.\n(4) Reasonableness of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Post-surrender Breach of Fiduciary Duty [94] I turn now to the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the post-surrender breach of fiduciary duty by the Crown.\n[95] The case law discussed above recognizes that changed circumstances affecting a decision to surrender, where the land in still owned by the Crown, typically require that the Crown consult with the First Nation and seek fresh instructions. As this Court held in Semiahmoo, \u201creasonable diligence\u201d requires that the [Crown] disclose\u2014and \u201cmove to correct\u201d\u2014any material facts that would affect a community\u2019s interests in the context of a surrender for sale. The Crown is remiss in meeting its post-fiduciary duties when it fails to do so (see para. 68). Investigation and disclosure are important in this context. Like this Court concluded in Semiahmoo, \u201chad the Crown moved with some degree of alacrity, the band could have benefitted from an earlier termination of what had turned out to be a bad deal for them\u201d (see para. 68, citing Lower Kootenay Indian Band v. Canada, [1992] 2 C.N.L.R. 54 (F.C.T.D.)).\n[96] The Tribunal came to similar conclusions in Doig River 2015at para. 167; and Huu-Ay-Aht at paras. 100, 104. In both cases, the Tribunal held that the Crown\u2019s failure to investigate and disclose the changed circumstances affecting surrendered lands prevented the Indigenous community involved from making an informed choice about its best interests.\n[97] It is clear from this line of jurisprudence that the Crown does not discharge its fiduciary duty by merely acting on the terms contained in the surrender document.\n[98] Contrary to the foregoing, the Tribunal in the instant case held that the Crown was not required to consider leasing the former IR 72A lands after the surrender was taken because the terms of the surrender were for sale. However, in the intervening years, during which the Crown failed to take any action on the matter, the reason that prompted the surrender in the first place may well have disappeared with the closure of the Round Lake Residential School. In addition, cottage development in the area was proceeding apace.\n[99] These were important changed circumstances that merited consideration by the Tribunal and assessment as to whether the Crown ought to have consulted with the KFN before proceeding with the sale and whether, in such consultations, the possibility of leasing ought to have been discussed. It was unreasonable for the Tribunal to have concluded that all that had transpired in the intervening years was the mere passage of time.\n[100] The Tribunal\u2019s characterization of the facts was therefore, once again, unreasonable. This characterization prevented it from assessing whether further consultation with the KFN or consideration of the option of leasing in 1956 was required.\n[101] I accordingly find that the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of these issues was unreasonable. It follows that the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on the impugned issues cannot stand.\nIV. Proposed Disposition [102] I would therefore set aside the Decision in part and remit to the Tribunal the issue of the Crown\u2019s breach of its pre and post-surrender fiduciary duties for redetermination, the whole in accordance with these Reasons. As I would find the KFN entirely successful, I would award it costs.\n\u201cMary J.L. Gleason\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nJudith Woods J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nJ.B.

The General Division of the Social Security Tribunal (SST) found that he was disqualified from receiving Employment Insurance benefits under section 30 of the Employment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996, c. 23, because he had lost his job due to his misconduct. The applicant now seeks judicial review of the August 7, 2023 decision of the Appeal Division of the SST (file number AD-23-193) affirming the General Division\u2019s decision.\n[2] The applicant submits that his failure to respect the vaccination policy was not misconduct because the policy did not allow alternatives to the vaccine and was therefore unreasonable. He also submits that the policy did not form part of his employment contract because the employer introduced it after he had signed the contract. Therefore, he argues, by failing to comply with the policy, he had not breached an express or implied duty resulting from the employment contract and had committed no misconduct.\n[3] The standard of review on the merits of the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is reasonableness: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65. A reasonable decision is based on internally coherent reasoning and is justified in light of the relevant legal and factual constraints: Vavilov at para. 99.\n[4] In its reasons, the Appeal Division considered the General Division\u2019s findings of fact, including that the applicant was aware of his employer\u2019s vaccination policy and that he knew he could be terminated for not following it. It considered the applicable jurisprudence of this Court and of the Federal Court on the meaning of the term \u201cmisconduct\u201d, including Canada (Attorney General) v. Lemire, 2010 FCA 314; Mishibinijima v Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 36; and Paradis v. Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 1282. It held that the General Division had correctly decided that whether the employer\u2019s vaccination policy was reasonable or justifiable was irrelevant to its finding of misconduct under the Act.\n[5] The Appeal Division decided that an employee who deliberately breaches an explicit policy set by his employer may be found to have committed misconduct under the Act whether or not compliance with the policy is expressly required by his employment contract, a conclusion consistent with decisions of this Court: Nelson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 222 at paras. 25\u201326; Lemire at paras. 17, 19\u201320. It held that the General Division did not err when it concluded that by refusing to disclose his vaccination status in contravention of the employer\u2019s explicit policy, the applicant committed misconduct under the Act.\n[6] In our view, the Appeal Division\u2019s decision is reasonable. It is supported by the evidentiary record and, as this Court has observed in recent decisions involving similar circumstances, by the applicable jurisprudence: see e.g. Kuk v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 74 at paras. 8\u20139; Sullivan v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 7 at paras. 4\u20136; Lalancette v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 58 at para. 2; and Zhelkov v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 240 at para. 5. The Appeal Division reasonably found that, in determining whether the applicant committed misconduct under the Act, it cannot assess the reasonableness of the employer\u2019s vaccination policy that led to his dismissal. We note that the applicant can raise that issue by way of other avenues, such as a wrongful dismissal action or a human rights complaint.\n[7] The applicant also submits that the Appeal Division treated him in a procedurally unfair manner. He observes that the summary of the test for misconduct set out by the General Division in its reasons did not match that provided by the Canada Employment Insurance Commission in its representations.\n[8] He disputes the relevance of certain questions posed during the hearing by the Appeal Division member. He asserts that the Appeal Division\u2019s explanation of the applicable legal principles took him by surprise and went further than what was discussed at the hearing.\n[9] Under the rules of procedural fairness, the applicant had the right to know the case he had to meet, the right to answer that case and the right to have his case considered fully and fairly by an impartial decision-maker: Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69, [2019] 1 F.C.R. 121 at para. 41. In our view, the applicant was afforded a fair hearing; his objections do not raise a reasonable apprehension of bias or a breach of procedural fairness.\n[10] For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss the application. As the respondent does not seek costs, we will not award any.\n\u201cGerald Heckman\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-232-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nCARMINE PALOZZI v.

The Tax Court dismissed the appellant\u2019s appeal of the Minister of National Revenue\u2019s assessments of his 2017, 2018, and 2019 taxation years.\n[2] The respondent has brought a motion to have the appeal summarily dismissed on the basis that it is bound to fail. Having regard to the notice of appeal, says the respondent, the true nature of the appellant\u2019s appeal before the Tax Court, and again before this Court, is not to challenge the correctness of the assessments. Rather, says the respondent, the appellant seeks to re-litigate disputes with other provincial and federal government actors, and seeks relief that neither the Tax Court, nor this Court on appeal, has jurisdiction to grant.\n[3] Alternatively, the respondent seeks an order that the appellant file an amended notice of appeal that raises only issues within this Court\u2019s jurisdiction and provides a clear and concise statement of appropriate and permitted grounds of appeal.\n[4] For the reasons that follow, I would grant the respondent\u2019s motion and dismiss the appeal.\nI. Background [5] The appeal before the Tax Court concerned assessments of the appellant\u2019s 2017, 2018 and 2019 taxation years. (In paragraphs 42 to 46 below, I address the appellant\u2019s allegation that he appealed his 2012-2023 taxation years.) The Minister issued those assessments in 2022 after the appellant failed to file tax returns following the Minister\u2019s written requests that he do so. The Minister assumed that the appellant\u2019s income in those years was comprised of old age security pension, Canada Pension Plan pension, and interest income. The Minister also assessed penalties for failure to file the returns.\n[6] Following his notice of objection, the appellant appealed the assessments under the Tax Court\u2019s informal procedure under section 18 of the Tax Court of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. T\u20112.\n[7] Before the Tax Court, the appellant\u2019s principal allegation was that he was unable to file his tax returns for 2017 to 2019, despite the Minister\u2019s request, because in 2017 his home, containing his tax records, was seized in connection with unrelated matters. He also argued that he should have been entitled to deductions, in particular depreciation, which would have resulted in less taxable income than was assessed.\n[8] The transcript of the proceedings before the Tax Court establishes that the appellant agreed that he had received income of the nature the Minister assessed, although he claimed some uncertainty regarding amounts. The appellant also conceded that he had not filed returns for 2017, 2018, and 2019.\n[9] The transcript also establishes that, when asked about the relevant depreciation (i.e., capital cost allowance for tax purposes), the appellant said it related to music equipment he had purchased many years earlier. He explained he had a balance carry forward to deduct until at least 2027.\n[10] Other than his oral testimony, the appellant led no evidence to refute the Minister\u2019s assumptions that, in each of 2017 to 2019, he earned income in the amounts the Minister assessed. The Tax Court found that, while the appellant \u201calluded to his entitlement to a depreciation expense, [he] has not provided the [Tax] Court with any cogent evidence to challenge the Minister\u2019s assumptions\u201d. The Tax Court pointed out that information about depreciation balances should have been in the returns he filed before 2017.\n[11] Relying on the Minister\u2019s assumptions and the appellant\u2019s concessions, the Tax Court concluded that the assessments were valid and dismissed the appeals. It refused to address any of the other claims advanced by the appellant, stating that it did not have the jurisdiction to do so.\n[12] The appellant has appealed that decision to this Court.\nII. Analysis A. Can this Court Summarily Dismiss an Appeal? [13] This Court may summarily dismiss an appeal, either upon motion from a respondent or on its own initiative, where the appeal is \u201cdoomed to fail owing to a fatal flaw or the absence of any merit\u201d: Bernard v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 236 at para.10.\n[14] This Court\u2019s power to do so stems from its plenary jurisdiction, including the powers necessary for its effective functioning and to manage its own proceedings: Dugr\u00e9 v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 8 at paras. 20-22. Keeping appeals that are doomed to fail on the roll, \u201cwaste judicial resources and impair access to justice for those who have a meritorious case\u201d: Dugr\u00e9 at para. 22, citing H\u00e9bert v. Wenham, 2020 FCA 186 at para. 8 and Fabrikant v. Canada, 2018 FCA 224 at para. 25.\nB. Is the Appeal Doomed to Fail? [15] The Tax Court decision under appeal, broadly speaking, did two things. It dismissed the appellant\u2019s appeal of the assessments and it refused to grant or address other relief the appellant sought from the Tax Court. I will address each of these aspects of the Tax Court decision in turn.\n[16] However, it is important to bear in mind what is necessary for the appellant to succeed in this appeal. Given the applicable standard of review\u2014the appellate standard\u2014to succeed on this appeal the appellant must establish that the Tax Court made a palpable and overriding error in determining an issue of fact or mixed fact and law, or erred in law: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33. A \u201cpalpable\u201d error is one that is obvious; an \u201coverriding error\u201d is an error that goes to the core of\u2014in other words would affect\u2014the outcome: Benhaim v. St-Germain, 2016 SCC 48 at para. 38, citing South Yukon Forest Corp. v. R., 2012 FCA 165 at para. 46.\n[17] Moreover, as the respondent submits, subsection 27(1.3) of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, restricts the grounds that may be raised in an appeal from a judgment made under the Tax Court\u2019s informal procedure. Any erroneous finding of fact must have been made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before it.\n[18] While I acknowledge that the appellant\u2019s notice of appeal purports to rely on the grounds permitted by subsection 27(1.3), I am satisfied that the appeal has no prospect of success. The Tax Court does not have jurisdiction to grant much of the relief the appellant requested and neither do we. In neither his notice of appeal nor his motion record, does the appellant identify a ground for appeal that meets the requirements of subsection 27(1.3) that has any prospect of success.\n(1) The Appellant\u2019s Request for Certain Relief Was Beyond the Tax Court\u2019s Jurisdiction [19] Most of the errors that the appellant alleges the Tax Court made have nothing to do with the correctness of the assessments, or the Tax Court\u2019s decision to dismiss the appeal of those assessments. Rather, with few exceptions (discussed below), the appellant\u2019s grounds of appeal relate to disputes with other government actors or public or quasi-public authorities\u2014the municipality, the police, Municipal Property Assessment Corporation, and Ontario\u2019s Chief Firearms Officer\u2014or to disagreements with decisions of other courts or regulatory bodies\u2014the Ontario Court of Justice, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, the Ontario Divisional Court, and the Law Society of Ontario.\n[20] Consistent with this, as he did before the Tax Court, the appellant seeks an order that seized property be restored to him, declarations that actions taken by the municipality are void, and declarations that provisions of particular Ontario statutes and federal statutes are inconsistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c. 11. He asserts that the Tax Court erred in not granting these orders and declarations when he was before it on his appeal.\n[21] The Tax Court and this Court do not have jurisdiction to grant that relief. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is defined by statute, in particular section 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act, and is limited: Bonnybrook Park Industrial Development Co. Ltd. v. Canada (National Revenue), 2018 FCA 136 at para. 19.\n[22] The Tax Court has exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals on matters arising under a number of statutes, including the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985 (5th Supp.), c. 1, to the extent the particular statute provides: Tax Court of Canada Act, s. 12(1).\n[23] When deciding an appeal from an assessment, the Tax Court is limited to vacating or varying the assessment or referring it back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment: Income Tax Act, s. 171(1). Neither the Tax Court of Canada Act nor the Income Tax Act gives the Tax Court jurisdiction to grant the relief the appellant says it erred in not granting.\n[24] On appeal of the Tax Court\u2019s decision, this Court\u2019s powers are limited to dismissing the appeal, referring the matter back to the Tax Court, or giving the decision that the Tax Court should have given: Federal Courts Act, s. 52(c). Because the Tax Court could not give the relief the appellant sought when he was before it, it cannot give it were we to refer the matter back. Nor can we give it on appeal.\n(2) The Appellant\u2019s Allegations Relating to the Tax Court\u2019s Decision on the Appeal of the Assessments are Doomed to Fail [25] I turn now to the portions of the appellant\u2019s notice of appeal that allege errors by the Tax Court that might be viewed as relating to the assessments that were before it. These are found in paragraphs 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the appellant\u2019s notice of appeal, but also are repeated and expanded upon elsewhere in it.\n[26] The first is that the Tax Court erred in law by assuming that the appellant\u2019s income and taxable income are the same. The second is that the Tax Court acted in a perverse or capricious manner, or without regard to the material before it, by suggesting the appellant was able to file a tax return. Finally, the appellant asserts that the Tax Court erred in law in ordering him to file tax returns without his tax records.\n[27] Before I address these alleged errors, an explanation about the role of the Minister\u2019s assumptions may be helpful.\n[28] When assessing a taxpayer, the Minister makes certain assumptions. The Minister\u2019s assumptions underlying the assessment must be described in the reply to the appellant\u2019s notice of appeal in the Tax Court: Tax Court of Canada Rules (Informal Procedure), SOR\/90-688b, s. 6(1)(d). To succeed before the Tax Court, a taxpayer has the onus of demolishing those assumptions (Lacroix v. Canada, 2008 FCA 241 at para. 18; Hickman Motors Ltd. v. Canada, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 336, 148 D.L.R. (4th) 1 at paras. 92-93), or establishing that, even if true, they do not support the assessment under appeal.\n[29] To demolish the assumptions, the taxpayer must convince the Tax Court, on a balance of probabilities, that the assumptions are incorrect, typically by leading relevant, credible evidence that does so. If the Tax Court is not convinced that the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact are incorrect, it is obliged to treat those assumptions as true: Pollock v. R. (1993), 161 N.R. 232, 94 D.T.C 6050 (F.C.A.) at para. 21.\n[30] Here, in the absence of returns from the appellant, the Minister made assumptions about the amount of income he earned based on information obtained from other sources. The Minister also assumed the appellant had not filed tax returns for 2017, 2018 and 2019. The Minister assessed tax on that income and late filing penalties.\n[31] With that context, I return to the three errors alleged by the appellant.\n[32] I cannot agree that the Tax Court assumed the appellant\u2019s taxable income was the same as income. (Here, I understand the appellant to mean \u201cnet income\u201d and \u201cgross income\u201d, respectively, because the only deduction he raised before the Tax Court was depreciation\u2014capital cost allowance in tax terms\u2014which is a deduction in computing income, not taxable income.) Rather, the effect of the Minister\u2019s assumptions is that the Minister assumed that the appellant\u2019s income and net income were the same. Put another way, the Minister assumed the appellant had income from three sources in amounts specified. The Minister computed the appellant\u2019s liability for taxes on the basis that those amounts constituted his only income and that he had no depreciation deduction.\n[33] Before the Tax Court, the appellant conceded that he received income of the nature assessed. Although he was not certain the amounts were correct, he led no evidence to dispute them. While he asserted an entitlement to depreciation, the Tax Court described that evidence as not \u201ccogent\u201d. In other words, based on the totality of the evidence, the Tax Court was not persuaded, on a balance of probabilities, that the Minister\u2019s assumptions or the assessments concerning his income were incorrect.\n[34] If the appellant believed the income amounts were incorrect, that he had a balance entitling him to capital cost allowance, or that other assumptions of fact underlying the assessments were wrong, the time to lead evidence to establish that was before the Tax Court. An appeal based on this first alleged error has no prospect of success.\n[35] I turn now to the second alleged error\u2014that the Tax Court acted without regard to the material before it in determining that the appellant could file a tax return. I first observe that the appellant admitted that he did not file tax returns for 2017, 2018 or 2019 and that the Minister had asked him to file them.\n[36] As described above, the appellant\u2019s principal argument was that because his property had been illegally seized by the municipality, he did not have access to his records or information, and thus could not complete his tax returns. He asserted that these acts deprived him of his right to file a tax return.\n[37] The Tax Court did not agree.\n[38] When asked why he could not seek the necessary information from other sources (including his former accountant(s), the payers of the income, or his earlier returns), the transcript makes clear the appellant did not have a satisfactory response. However, even if the Tax Court accepted all of the appellant\u2019s allegations about other actors as true, that would not permit it to allow his appeal and vacate the assessments.\n[39] Where an assessment of income tax is appealed to the Tax Court, the only issue before the Tax Court is the validity of the assessment based on the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act: Main Rehabilitation Co. v. Canada, 2004 FCA 403 at para. 8; Ereiser v. Canada, 2013 FCA 20 at para. 31. It is \u201cclear that the Tax Court of Canada does not have the jurisdiction to cancel an established assessment based on improper conduct by the Minister\u201d (Robertson v. Canada, 2017 FCA 168 at para. 59) or any other government representative, even if that conduct is proven and might be viewed as \u201creprehensible conduct\u2026such as abuse of power or unfairness\u201d: JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc. v. Canada (National Revenue), 2013 FCA 250 at para. 83, and cases there cited.\n[40] Thus, an appeal based on the Tax Court\u2019s failure to take into account the appellant\u2019s allegations regarding the seizure of his property has no prospect of success.\n[41] The third alleged error is that the Tax Court ordered the appellant to file returns for the 2020, 2021, and 2022 taxation years. While in the course of its oral reasons, the Tax Court urged the appellant to file those returns, it did not order him to do so. The Tax Court\u2019s clear motivation was to warn the appellant that failure to file them could result in further assessments of penalties for failure to file. Importantly, the Tax Court\u2019s judgment does not order the appellant to file tax returns; it only dismisses \u201cthe appeal from the assessment made under the Income Tax Act for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 taxation years\u2026without costs.\u201d An appeal alleging the Tax Court erred in making an order it did not make has no prospect of success.\nC. Did the Tax Court\u2019s Judgment Address the Relevant Taxation Years? [42] I must address one final point. The appellant\u2019s notice of appeal filed with the Tax Court purported to appeal his 2012 to 2023 taxation years. However, the Tax Court judgment clearly only addresses assessments of the 2017, 2018 and 2019 taxation years. While the appellant claims this was an error, he cannot appeal assessments of taxation years to the Tax Court simply by listing them on his notice of appeal.\n[43] An assessment may be appealed to the Tax Court only after a notice of objection to that assessment has been filed with the Canada Revenue Agency: Income Tax Act, s. 169(1). Moreover, the time within which an objection may be filed is limited: Income Tax Act, ss. 165, 166.1(1), 166.2(1).\n[44] I have carefully read the transcript of the proceeding before the Tax Court, the notice of appeal filed in the Tax Court, and the Minister\u2019s reply to that notice of appeal. I am satisfied that the only taxation years properly before the Tax Court were the 2017, 2018 and 2019 taxation years. Obviously, his 2022 and 2023 assessment could not be before the Tax Court given he filed his notice of appeal on April 6, 2023.\n[45] However, even if the other taxation years referred to in his notice of appeal were properly before the Tax Court, the Tax Court\u2019s judgment only dismisses the appeals of the 2017, 2018 and 2019 assessments. Had they properly been before the Tax Court, nothing in the decision under appeal suggests they are not still before it.\n[46] Thus, an appeal based on the Tax Court\u2019s failure to address any other taxation years has no prospect of success.\nIII. Conclusion [47] I have read the transcript and the notice of appeal filed in the Tax Court. As the respondent puts it, \u201c[a] holistic and practical reading of the Notice of Appeal reveals the Appellant [did] not challenge the correctness of the assessment at issue\u201d: Respondent\u2019s Written Representations at para. 10.\n[48] Rather, the focus of the appellant\u2019s complaint before the Tax Court was the actions of others\u2014that he was prevented from filing his returns because his property had been seized. The substance of what he sought from the Tax Court is various orders and declarations that it cannot give, and so we cannot give on appeal.\n[49] To conclude, I am satisfied that this appeal has no prospect of success. I am also satisfied that no amendments to the notice of appeal could lead to a different result. Accordingly, I would grant the respondent\u2019s motion and dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\u201cK.A.

The initial assessment issued by the Minister was based on both deductions being allowed. TPine was subsequently reassessed to deny the deduction for CCA and a penalty under subsection 163(2) of the Act was also assessed. In the Minister\u2019s view, the assets included in Class 10 and Class 16 (on which the CCA was claimed) included the same equipment that TPine had sold (the cost of which was deducted as cost of goods sold).\n[3] The Tax Court (per Wong J., 2022 TCC 134) allowed certain proposed amendments to the reply filed by the Crown to include the following alternative argument or basis: if TPine is successful in challenging the denial of the CCA, TPine\u2019s appeal to the Tax Court should still be dismissed on the basis that TPine should not have been allowed to claim the full amount of cost of goods sold that was allowed by the Minister.\n[4] For the reasons that follow I would dismiss this appeal.\n[5] In these reasons references to assessing or an assessment should be read, where necessary as including reassessing or a reassessment.\nI. Background [6] TPine is in the business of loan and equipment financing. The Tax Court Judge stated that the business also included the sale of lease receivables and equipment while TPine, in its memorandum at paragraph 2, described this aspect of its business as securitizing \u201cleases which it reported as a sale of leases receivable\u201d.\n[7] There does not appear to be any dispute that TPine claimed an amount for CCA and an amount for cost of goods sold in 2015. There is a dispute regarding whether TPine is entitled to claim both deductions.\n[8] A deduction for CCA is not claimed on any particular asset, but rather it is based on the undepreciated capital cost of a particular class of assets. In this appeal, the relevant classes of assets are Class 10 and Class 16 (trucks and trailers). Therefore, the CCA would have been claimed based on the undepreciated capital cost of these two classes of assets, not on any particular asset. For ease of reference and brevity, these reasons will refer to the CCA claimed on particular assets rather than CCA being claimed based on a determination of the undepreciated capital cost of Class 10 and Class 16 assets that did not reflect a disposition of certain assets during the taxation year.\n[9] In initially assessing TPine\u2019s 2015 taxation year on June 23, 2016, the Minister allowed a deduction for CCA claimed on Class 10 and Class 16 assets (trucks and trailers) in the amount of $5,887,282, based on the assumption that certain assets were owned by TPine at the end of its taxation year. It is not clear whether the amount disallowed as CCA was the entire amount of CCA claimed for these two classes or only a portion of the amount of CCA claimed for Class 10 and Class 16.\n[10] As set out in the amended reply, in initially assessing TPine\u2019s 2015 taxation year an additional deduction of $17,604,192 for cost of goods sold (in relation to the same equipment on which the Minister alleges CCA was claimed) was also allowed.\n[11] TPine was subsequently reassessed on June 19, 2019. While a number of adjustments were made, the only adjustment that is relevant in this appeal is the denial of the deduction for CCA. No adjustment was made to the cost of goods sold that was claimed by TPine. It is the Minister\u2019s view that these two amounts were claimed in relation to the same assets. Whether the amount claimed for the cost of goods sold is for the same assets on which an amount was claimed for CCA is a matter to be determined by the Tax Court.\n[12] TPine filed an appeal with the Tax Court. The Minister subsequently reassessed TPine on November 30, 2020 to disallow the carry-back of certain non-capital losses. TPine filed a fresh as amended notice of appeal. The Crown\u2019s reply (and a corrected version thereof) were both filed on April 27, 2021.\n[13] Following the filing of the replies and the exchange of the lists of documents, but before examinations for discovery were commenced, the Crown brought a motion to amend the reply. The proposed amendments are set out in paragraph 9 of the Crown\u2019s memorandum in this appeal:\na. revised paragraphs 32 and 34 to add to the assessing history that the Assessment allowed the Appellant\u2019s claim for a [cost of goods sold] deduction and the Reassessment maintained it.\nb. added subparagraph 40(c.l) to correct the amount of the Appellant\u2019s claimed [cost of goods sold] deduction ($17,604,192), because the Minister had assumed an incorrect amount ($17,901,764).\nc. added paragraph 41.1, which raises the following alternative issue:\nIn the alternative, if the Appellant is entitled to the Denied CCA, is the amount of tax assessed in the Reassessment too high because it allowed the Appellant a deduction for [cost of goods sold] for the Subject Equipment?\nd. revised paragraph 42 to add sections 10 and 54 of the Act to the statutory provisions on which the Respondent intends to rely.\ne. added paragraphs 44.1 and 44.2 and the subheading preceding them. They introduce and advance the alternative argument. They read:\n44.1 The ultimate issue in any appeal to this Court is whether the amount of tax assessed is too high.\n44.2 An alternative issue is therefore, if the Appellant remained the owner of the Subject Equipment, whether the tax assessed in the Reassessment is too high. It is not. The Reassessment allowed the Appellant\u2019s claimed [cost of goods sold] deduction of $17,604,192 for the Subject Equipment. Pursuant to paragraph 18(1)(b) of the Act and paragraph 1102(l)(b) of the Regulations, the Appellant is not entitled to claim both [cost of goods sold] and CCA for the same property.\nII. Subsection 152(9) of the Act [14] Subsection 152(9) of the Act allows the Minister to advance an alternative argument or basis in support of an assessment. This subsection was added to the Act in 1999 and amended in 2016. The original and revised versions of this subsection are as follows:\nSubsection 152(9) as added in 1999\n(9) The Minister may advance an alternative argument in support of an assessment at any time after the normal reassessment period unless, on an appeal under this Act\n(9) Le ministre peut avancer un nouvel argument \u00e0 l\u2019appui d\u2019une cotisation apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation, sauf si, sur appel interjet\u00e9 en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi :\n(a) there is relevant evidence that the taxpayer is no longer able to adduce without the leave of the court; and\na) d\u2019une part, il existe des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que le contribuable n\u2019est plus en mesure de produire sans l\u2019autorisation du tribunal;\n(b) it is not appropriate in the circumstances for the court to order that the evidence be adduced.\nb) d\u2019autre part, il ne convient pas que le tribunal ordonne la production des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans les circonstances.\nSubsection 152(9) as amended in 2016\n(9) At any time after the normal reassessment period, the Minister may advance an alternative basis or argument \u2014 including that all or any portion of the income to which an amount relates was from a different source \u2014 in support of all or any portion of the total amount determined on assessment to be payable or remittable by a taxpayer under this Act unless, on an appeal under this Act\n(9) Apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation, le ministre peut avancer un nouveau fondement ou un nouvel argument \u2014 y compris un fondement ou un argument selon lequel tout ou partie du revenu auquel une somme se rapporte provenait d\u2019une autre source \u2014 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de tout ou partie de la somme totale qui est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e lors de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une cotisation comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 payer ou \u00e0 verser par un contribuable en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi, sauf si, sur appel interjet\u00e9 en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi :\n(a) there is relevant evidence that the taxpayer is no longer able to adduce without the leave of the court; and\na) d\u2019une part, il existe des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que le contribuable n\u2019est plus en mesure de produire sans l\u2019autorisation du tribunal;\n(b) it is not appropriate in the circumstances for the court to order that the evidence be adduced.\nb) d\u2019autre part, il ne convient pas que le tribunal ordonne la production des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans les circonstances.\nIII. Decision of the Tax Court [15] The Tax Court Judge made the following finding with respect to whether the revised version of subsection 152(9) of the Act was relevant in this matter:\n[6] The introductory portion of subsection 152(9) was amended in 2016 to apply to appeals instituted after December 15, 2016. The amendment seems to have expanded or clarified the scope of alternative bases or arguments which may be made by the Minister. Specifically, the change focuses on source-based issues so the distinction between the previous and current wording is not relevant to the present motion.\n[16] The Tax Court Judge then referred to the decision of this Court in Walsh v. Canada, 2007 FCA 222 (Walsh), which set out certain conditions in relation to subsection 152(9) of the Act. The decision in Walsh related to the version of subsection 152(9) of the Act prior to the 2016 amendments.\n[17] The Tax Court Judge found that the proposed amendments to paragraphs 32 and 34 of the reply simply clarified the assessing history and the new paragraph 40(c.1) of the reply corrected the amount that the Minister had allowed as the cost of goods sold. Paragraph 42 was revised to include additional references to statutory provisions.\n[18] The new paragraphs (41.1, 44.1 and 44.2) set out the alternative argument that if TPine continued to own the equipment in issue, its appeal should still be dismissed because the amount allowed as a deduction for cost of goods sold exceeded the amount denied as a deduction for CCA. The Tax Court Judge allowed this amendment on the basis that \u201c[i]t is a consideration in every appeal as to whether the Court\u2019s decision puts the taxpayer in a worse position but in the circumstances, it is better for both the trier of fact and the appellant to have this argument expressly laid out than for the argument to remain underlying\u201d (paragraph 20).\nIV. Issue and Standard of Review [19] The issue in this appeal is whether subsection 152(9) of the Act allows the Minister to rely on the following alternative argument or basis: if TPine is successful in challenging the denial of the amount claimed as CCA, its appeal should still be dismissed because the amount that was allowed as a deduction for cost of goods sold exceeded the amount that was denied as a deduction for CCA.\n[20] Since the issue in this appeal is the interpretation of subsection 152(9) of the Act, the standard of review is correctness (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33).\nV. Analysis [21] TPine appealed the allowance of all of the proposed amendments to the reply. In my view, there is no basis to challenge the Tax Court Judge\u2019s decision to allow the amendments made to paragraphs 32, 34, 40(c.1) and 42 of the reply.\n[22] In their submissions in this appeal, the parties focused on the amendments related to the alternative argument or basis (new paragraphs 41.1, 44.1 and 44.2). These reasons will also focus on these amendments.\n[23] The proposed new paragraphs (41.1, 44.1 and 44.2) would mean that if TPine is successful in establishing that it was entitled to claim the CCA that was denied, and if the amount allowed as a deduction for the cost of goods sold was a deduction for the same equipment on which the CCA was claimed, TPine\u2019s appeal would be dismissed.\n[24] In this matter, the amount of the CCA deduction that was denied was $5,887,282. The amount that was allowed as a deduction for the cost of goods sold was $17,604,192. If TPine is entitled to the deduction of $5,887,282 for CCA, to keep TPine\u2019s tax liability at the same amount that was reassessed (and hence dismiss TPine\u2019s appeal), it would be as if the amount allowed for cost of goods sold was reduced by $5,887,282.\nA. Obstacles to reassessing now [25] If the Minister were to now reassess TPine to reduce the amount allowed for cost of goods sold by $5,887,282, the Minister would face two obstacles.\n[26] First, subsection 152(5) of the Act imposes a limitation on reassessments after the expiration of the normal reassessment period:\n(5) There shall not be included in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year, for the purpose of an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment made under this Part after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year, any amount that was not included in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for the purpose of an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment made under this Part before the end of the period.\n(5) N\u2019est pas \u00e0 inclure dans le calcul du revenu d\u2019un contribuable pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition en vue de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement, apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation qui lui est applicable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e, d\u2019une cotisation, d\u2019une nouvelle cotisation ou d\u2019une cotisation suppl\u00e9mentaire en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie le montant qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus dans le calcul de son revenu en vue de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement, avant la fin de cette p\u00e9riode, d\u2019une cotisation, d\u2019une nouvelle cotisation ou d\u2019une cotisation suppl\u00e9mentaire en vertu de cette partie.\n[27] By reassessing TPine to deny a portion of the deduction for the cost of goods sold, the Minister would be including in TPine\u2019s income an amount that was not included in computing its income prior to the expiration of the normal reassessment period. Since TPine\u2019s 2015 taxation year was originally assessed on June 23, 2016, the normal reassessment period has expired.\n[28] Subsection 152(5) of the Act does not apply if TPine made a misrepresentation as contemplated by subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) of the Act. Since the Minister allowed the deduction for the full amount claimed as cost of goods sold, it may be difficult for the Minister to establish that TPine made the requisite misrepresentation in relation to the claim for the cost of goods sold. The comments of the Tax Court Judge in Last v. The Queen, 2012 TCC 352 (Last TCC), are apropos.\n[29] In Last TCC, the taxpayer had been assessed on the basis that the gain realized on a disposition of certain shares was a capital gain. The taxpayer appealed to the Tax Court claiming that the gain on the disposition of the shares was an income gain, as the taxpayer was also claiming certain deductions. The taxpayer was unsuccessful with respect to his claimed deductions. While the Tax Court Judge found that there was ample evidence to support a finding that the gain realized by the taxpayer was an income gain, the Tax Court Judge, in relation to an argument that the taxation year was not statute barred (and therefore the taxpayer could be reassessed on the basis that the gain was an income gain) stated:\n[54] The question, then, is whether a reassessment that changes the ISTO gains from capital to income would be statute barred. In my view it would be. The limitation period will have expired unless the appellant has made a careless or negligent misrepresentation in the income tax return. It would be difficult for the Crown to suggest that he has when the Crown\u2019s primary argument in this appeal is that the gains are on capital account.\n[30] Since the Minister\u2019s primary argument in this matter is that TPine is entitled to deduct the amount claimed as cost of goods sold, it may be difficult for the Minister to argue that TPine made a misrepresentation that was attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default in claiming this deduction for cost of goods sold.\n[31] The second obstacle that the Minister would face in reassessing TPine to reduce its cost of goods sold by $5,887,282 is that this would still leave a deduction of $11,716,910 ($17,604,192 - $5,887,282) for cost of goods sold. How could a reduction of the cost of goods sold by approximately one-third be defensible based on the facts and the law?\n[32] Stratas J.A., writing on behalf of this Court in CIBC World Markets Inc. v. Canada, 2012 FCA 3, summarized the guiding principles that restrict the Minister to assessing in accordance with the facts and the law:\n[22] This Court is bound by its decision in Galway v. Minister of National Revenue, [1974] 1 F.C. 600 (C.A.). In that decision, Jackett C.J., writing for the unanimous Court, stated (at page 602) that \u201cthe Minister has a statutory duty to assess the amount of tax payable on the [facts] as he finds them in accordance with the law as he understands it.\u201d In his view, \u201cit follows that he cannot assess for some amount designed to implement a compromise settlement.\u201d The Minister is obligated to assess \u201con the facts in accordance with the law and not to implement a compromise settlement.\u201d See also Cohen v. The Queen, [1980] C.T.C. 318 (F.C.A.).\n[23] More recently, this Court reaffirmed Galway in Harris v. Canada, [2000] 4 F.C. 37 (C.A.). Sexton J.A., writing for the unanimous Court, stated (at paragraph 37) that \u201cthe Minister of National Revenue is limited to making decisions based solely on considerations arising from the Act itself\u201d and cannot make \u201cdeals\u201d divorced from those considerations. To similar effect, see Longley v. Minister of National Revenue (1992), 66 B.C.L.R. (2d) 238 (C.A.) at page 455.\n[24] CIBC World Markets cites 1390758 Ontario Corporation v. The Queen, 2010 TCC 572 at paragraph 36 and Smerchanski v. Minister of National Revenue, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 23 for the proposition that courts have enforced settlements that apply tax law to agreed facts. That is true. But the Minister\u2019s power to agree to facts is limited by the Galway principle \u2014 the Minister cannot agree to an assessment that is indefensible on the facts and the law. Nothing in 1390758 Ontario and Smerchanski undercuts the Galway principle.\n[emphasis added]\n[33] The principle that the Minister must assess in accordance with the facts and the law was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada (Attorney General) v. Collins Family Trust, 2022 SCC 26, at paragraph 26.\n[34] If, as the Minister alleges, the same assets were included in the classes of assets on which CCA was claimed, and for which a deduction was claimed for cost of goods sold, and if those assets were not sold, there does not appear to be any basis to support a denial of approximately one-third of the amount claimed for cost of goods sold. It would appear that a reassessment that reduced the cost of goods sold by $5,887,282 would not be defensible on the facts and the law.\nB. Subsection 152(9) of the Act [35] In this appeal, however, the Minister is not seeking to reassess TPine to reduce the cost of goods sold, but rather is seeking to ask the Tax Court to dismiss TPine\u2019s appeal in relation to the CCA claimed if TPine is successful in establishing that it was entitled to deduct the CCA that was denied, and if the amount for cost of goods sold was claimed in relation to the same assets. In effect, the Minister is attempting to have the amount of taxes payable by TPine determined as if a portion of the amount claimed for the cost of goods sold was disallowed without reassessing TPine to disallow this amount.\n[36] The question is whether subsection 152(9) of the Act allows the Minister to support the assessment of TPine\u2019s 2015 taxation year if TPine is successful in establishing that it was entitled to the CCA that was denied, but there is an offsetting related deduction that was allowed by the Minister for cost of goods sold which, in the Minister\u2019s view, should not have been allowed. The Minister would not be attempting to have the taxes determined as if the full amount claimed for cost of goods sold was denied. Rather, in effect, the Minister would be asking to have TPine\u2019s appeal dismissed on the basis that the taxes payable by TPine would be equal to (or greater than) the amount as reassessed if TPine is entitled to the CCA claim that was denied and is not entitled to claim the amount allowed as cost of goods sold.\n[37] A textual, contextual and purposive analysis is required to determine the interpretation of subsection 152(9) of the Act (Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, at para. 10). While there are several decisions that address the interpretation of subsection 152(9) of the Act as it was worded prior to the amendments made in 2016, neither party was able to locate any decision addressing this subsection following the 2016 amendments. The parties were given the opportunity to provide further written submissions concerning the interpretation of this subsection and, in particular, whether the amendments overturned the decision of this Court in Petro-Canada v. Canada, 2004 FCA 158 (Petro-Canada), which is discussed further below. The parties filed their additional submissions on January 31, 2024, February 14, 2024 and February 21, 2024.\n[38] Three changes were made to subsection 152(9) of the Act in 2016:\n(a)the addition of an alternative \u201cbasis\u201d (the previous version only referred to an alternative argument);\n(b)the addition of the following words after an alternative basis or argument \u2015 \u201cincluding that all or any portion of the income to which an amount relates was from a different source\u201d; and\n(c)the change in wording from \u201cin support of an assessment\u201d to \u201cin support of all or any portion of the total amount determined on assessment to be payable or remittable by a taxpayer under this Act\u201d.\n[39] These changes would not result in any alternative argument that could have been raised, based on the prior version of subsection 152(9) of the Act, now being unavailable. Since there are a number of decisions that address the prior version of subsection 152(9) of the Act, the starting point will be to determine if the proposed amendments to the Minister\u2019s reply would have been allowed under the prior version of subsection 152(9) of the Act. If so, then since the amended version of subsection 152(9) of the Act does not impose any further restrictions on what alternative argument may be raised, there would be no need to consider what additional argument or basis would be permitted based on the amended version of subsection 152(9) of the Act.\n[40] The following decisions will be addressed:\n(a)Continental Bank of Canada v. Canada, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 358, [1998] 4 C.T.C. 77 (Continental Bank);\n(b)Pedwell v. Canada, [2000] 4 F.C. 616, 2000 D.T.C. 6405 (C.A.) (Pedwell);\n(c)Canada v. Anchor Pointe Energy Ltd., 2003 FCA 294 (Anchor Pointe);\n(d)Canada v. Loewen, 2004 FCA 146 (Loewen);\n(e)Petro-Canada;\n(f)Walsh; and\n(g)Canada v. Last, 2014 FCA 129 (Last).\nC. Continental Bank [41] Subsection 152(9) was added to the Act following the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Continental Bank and the related decision in Continental Bank Leasing Corp. v. Canada, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 298, [1998] 4 C.T.C. 119.\n[42] Continental Bank of Canada (Continental Bank) and Continental Bank Leasing Corp. (CB Leasing) entered into a number of transactions that included:\n(a)the transfer of certain assets by CB Leasing to a newly formed partnership in exchange for a 99% partnership interest in that partnership;\n(b)an election being made under subsection 97(2) of the Act in relation to this transfer of assets by CB Leasing to the partnership;\n(c)the winding-up of CB Leasing into Continental Bank (which resulted in a transfer of the partnership interest to Continental Bank); and\n(d)a sale of this partnership interest by Continental Bank to subsidiaries of Central Capital Leasing (693396 Ontario Limited and 693397 Ontario Limited).\n[43] CB Leasing filed its tax returns on the basis that it had filed a valid election under subsection 97(2) of the Act in relation to the transfer of assets to the partnership and that subsection 88(1) of the Act applied on its winding-up into Continental Bank. As a result, while Continental Bank reported a capital gain on its sale of the partnership interest, CB Leasing did not report any tax liability resulting from the transfer of assets to the partnership or its winding-up.\n[44] CB Leasing was reassessed on the basis that the partnership was not a valid partnership and that the true nature of the transactions was a sale of depreciable capital property by CB Leasing to the subsidiaries of Central Capital Leasing. As a result, CB Leasing was reassessed to include recaptured CCA in its income.\n[45] Continental Bank was also reassessed, in the alternative, on the basis that the gain reported on the disposition of the partnership interest was not a capital gain, but rather an income gain.\n[46] The majority of the Supreme Court found that the partnership was a valid partnership and the transactions were to be taxed as reported by Continental Bank and CB Leasing. The comments of the Supreme Court with respect a new argument raised by the Crown are relevant in this matter:\n18 The next event occurred on December 29, 1986 when the Bank transferred its interest in the partnership to 693396 and 693397. The Minister cannot argue that the Bank could not transfer its partnership interest at this stage. The Minister must accept that this transfer took place because his assessment of the Bank was based on the assumption that the Bank disposed of its partnership interest. I agree with Bastarache J. that the Minister\u2019s argument that the Bank sold depreciable leasing assets or was otherwise liable for recapture of capital cost allowance pursuant to s. 88(1) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, as amended, raised for the first time in this Court, cannot be entertained. The Minister should not be allowed to advance a new basis for a reassessment after the limitation period has expired.\n[emphasis added]\n[47] The Supreme Court found that the Minister cannot not raise a new basis for a reassessment after the limitation period has expired. The Supreme Court also uses \u201cargument\u201d and \u201cbasis\u201d interchangeably as the first reference is to the \u201cMinister\u2019s argument\u201d, and in the immediately following sentence the Court concludes that the \u201cMinister should not be allowed to advance a new basis for a reassessment\u201d.\n[48] Following the addition of subsection 152(9) to the Act, there were a number of cases that considered whether this subsection would allow the Minister to raise a new argument.\nD. Pedwell [49] In Pedwell, the taxpayer was assessed on the basis that he had appropriated certain sums from his company which were included in his income. The Tax Court found that the taxpayer had not appropriated the sums in issue, but rather that he had appropriated different amounts.\n[50] Rothstein J.A., as he then was, writing for this Court, found that the Minister was bound by the basis of the assessment issued by the Minister:\n[15] While the parties referred to a number of older authorities on the issue, Continental Bank now makes it clear (subject to subsection 152(9) [Income Tax Act, R.S.C., 1985 (5th Supp.), c. 1 (as am. by S.C. 1999, c. 22, s. 63.1)] which applies to appeals disposed of after June 17, 1999 and is not relevant here in any event) that the Minister is bound by his basis of assessment. While this case does not involve the Minister advancing a different basis of assessment, I think the principle in Continental Bank is applicable to a judicial determination on a basis different from that in the notice of reassessment.\n[emphasis added]\n[51] This Court found that the Minister was bound by his basis of assessment as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court in Continental Bank.\n[52] Rothstein J.A. rejected the Crown\u2019s arguments that any argument that did not change the amount of tax payable was acceptable:\n[21] The Minister advances two arguments. The first is that the issue in a tax appeal is whether the tax is too high. The implication of this argument is that anything can be argued in the Tax Court and the Tax Court Judge is limited only to the amount of the assessment. In other words, as long as a finding does not exceed the amount of the tax assessed by the Minister, the Tax Court Judge is free to find liability against the taxpayer on any basis, whether included in the notice of reassessment or not, provided the taxpayer has notice and an opportunity to respond.\n[22] I think Continental Bank is dispositive on this point. The Crown and therefore the Court are bound by the assessment appealed from, unless it has been amended, or adequate notice given of an intention to rely on a different basis for it, within the limitation period and certainly before judgment is rendered by the Tax Court. This was not the case here.\n[23] The second of the Crown\u2019s arguments is that what transpired is all part of one scheme; that the acquisition of the 84 acres, the sale to Eulers and the deposit received from Landpark cannot be separated for tax purposes. However, what transpired were three separate transactions involving different parties:\n(1) the acquisition of the 84 acres;\n(2) the sale of one lot to Eulers; and\n(3) the deposit received from Landpark for 16 lots.\nThis is seen in the Minister\u2019s notice of reassessment. In the October 1, 1994 reassessment, the appropriation of the 84 acres is listed, followed by the alleged unreported profit on the Euler sale. On the April 4, 1996 notice of reassessment, the Euler transaction is eliminated. The necessary implication is that the appellant need have no further worry that the Euler proceeds constituted an appropriation to him and that he may concentrate on the acquisition of the 84 acres. This was confirmed before the Tax Court Judge in the excerpt from the transcript quoted above. Finally, nowhere on the reassessments is there any mention of the Landpark deposit of $22,500.\n[24] I do not say that the Minister might not base an assessment on a scheme consisting of more than one transaction. However, taxation is transaction-based (or perhaps deemed transaction-based) and if more than one transaction is to form the basis of assessment, the assessment must reflect that fact. Where the basis of the Minister\u2019s assessment is one transaction, the Court cannot, ex post facto, broaden the scope of the assessment to include other transactions.\n[emphasis added]\n[53] Although subsection 152(9) of the Act applied to appeals disposed of after June 17, 1999 (and the Tax Court appeal in Pedwell was disposed of on October 29, 1998), Pedwell is cited in a number of subsequent decisions addressing subsection 152(9) of the Act. In Pedwell, the Minister was not attempting to raise a new argument on appeal to this Court, but rather was attempting to support the alternative basis on which the Tax Court Judge relied in rendering his decision. Rothstein J.A.\u2019s comment that subsection 152(9) \u201cis not relevant here in any event\u201d indicates that this subsection was considered but would not have assisted the Minister if it had been applicable.\n[54] The finding that the Minister cannot include transactions that did not form the basis of an assessment reappears in subsequent decisions, including Walsh, discussed further below.\nE. Anchor Pointe [55] In Anchor Pointe, Anchor Pointe Energy Ltd. (Anchor Pointe) was reassessed to reduce the amount that it had claimed as Canadian exploration expenses (CEE) on the basis that the fair market value of certain seismic data was less than the amount as claimed by Anchor Pointe. After the expiration of the normal reassessment period for Anchor Pointe, this Court released its decision in Global Communications Limited v. The Queen, [1999] 3 C.T.C. 537, 99 D.T.C. 5377 (F.C.A.) (Global). In Global, this Court found that seismic data acquired for resale did not qualify as CEE for the purposes of the Act. The Minister then raised an additional argument in Anchor Pointe\u2019s appeal based on the decision of this Court in Global. The issue before this Court was whether the parts of the reply filed with the Tax Court, that referred to the argument based on Global, should be struck.\n[56] It should be noted that the Minister had allowed a deduction for CEE. If the Minister\u2019s argument that Anchor Pointe had acquired the seismic data for resale would have been successful, Anchor Pointe would not have been entitled to any deduction for CEE (which would result in an increase in income if the amount allowed as a deduction for CEE was reduced to nil).\n[57] Rothstein J.A. found that the Minister could raise this argument. The Minister had acknowledged that the result of this new argument could not be an increase in Anchor Pointe\u2019s liability under the Act and, based on subsection 152(5) of the Act, the Court agreed (paragraphs 34 and 35).\n[58] In addressing subsection 152(9) of the Act, the Court stated:\n[37] Subsection 152(9) permits the Minister to rely upon an alternative argument in support of an assessment after the normal reassessment period. There is no suggestion here that Anchor Pointe is no longer able to adduce relevant evidence with respect to the Minister's new basis or argument. Therefore, if the Global decision constitutes a new basis or argument in support of the reassessment, the Minister may rely upon it even though it was not relied upon prior to expiry of the normal reassessment period.\n[38] Anchor Pointe tries to distinguish between a new basis of assessment and a new argument in support of an assessment. I do not find that semantical argument productive. The question is whether the Minister is purporting, through reliance on the Global decision, to increase the amount of Anchor Pointe\u2019s income that was not included in an assessment or reassessment made within the normal reassessment period.\n[39] In my opinion, he was not. This case is unlike cases such as Pedwell v. The Queen, 2000 DTC 6050 (F.C.A.), where the Minister sought to take into account different transactions than the ones that formed the basis of the reassessments that were made within the normal reassessment period. I do not say that taking into account other transactions is the only thing the Minister cannot do after expiry of the normal reassessment period. Anything that increases tax payable from what would have been the case prior to expiry of the normal reassessment period would be objectionable.\n[40] Here, the Minister does not seek to rely on Global to increase Anchor Pointe\u2019s taxes payable over what was included in the Minister\u2019s reassessment prior to expiry of the normal reassessment period. The reassessment increased taxes payable by reducing CEE deductions by the difference between the amount claimed and the amount based on the Minister\u2019s estimation of the fair market value of the seismic data. On confirming the reassessment, the Minister does not seek to increase that amount. He is not introducing a new transaction. He is only relying on an additional argument, that there is no CEE deduction allowed where the acquisition of the seismic data is for resale or licensing.\n[emphasis added]\n[59] In Anchor Pointe, the dispute was focused on the one component of the deduction for CEE that was claimed and which was the subject of the reassessment \u2015 the amount included for certain seismic data in determining the CEE of Anchor Pointe. The Minister was not seeking to increase the tax liability of the taxpayer, nor was the Minister seeking to introduce a new transaction.\n[60] In Anchor Pointe, this Court, in paragraph 38, also rejected the argument that a distinction should be drawn between whether the Minister is raising a new argument or a new basis.\n[61] In Pedwell, this Court found that the Minister was bound by the basis of his assessment. In Anchor Pointe, an exception to this general principle was adopted. The Minister was not bound to accept that Anchor Pointe was entitled to any CEE, even though an amount for CEE had been allowed. The Minister was, in effect, permitted to appeal the assessment on the basis that no amount should have been allowed as CEE, provided that the amount of tax payable was not increased. This alternative argument arose following the decision of this Court in Global which was issued after Anchor Pointe was assessed and only arose in relation to the particular amount in dispute \u2014 the amount included in CEE for particular seismic data.\nF. Loewen [62] In Loewen, this Court relied on Anchor Pointe to find that the Crown could raise a new argument related to a claim for CCA. The taxpayer had claimed a deduction for CCA in relation to certain software. The Minister reassessed the taxpayer to reduce the deduction for CCA on the basis that the fair market value of the software was less than the amount as stated by the taxpayer. After the expiration of the normal reassessment period, the Minister raised an argument that the software had not been acquired for the purpose of earning income. Although this argument would result in no CCA being allowed as a deduction, the Minister was not raising this argument to reduce the CCA to nil but, rather to defend the assessment:\n[46] In Mr. Loewen\u2019s case, the Crown wishes to argue that Mr. Loewen did not acquire his interest in the software for the purpose of gaining or producing income. If that argument is valid, Mr. Loewen should not have been permitted to deduct any capital cost allowance. Because the statutory limitation period has passed, the Minister cannot now reassess to increase Mr. Loewen\u2019s tax liability by reducing his capital cost allowance deduction. However, the Crown is not seeking to reduce the capital cost allowance deduction to nil, but only to defend the Minister's reassessment, which reduced the deduction to reflect what the Minister alleges is the fair market value of Mr. Loewen\u2019s interest in the software. That is essentially what the Crown was permitted to do in Anchor Pointe.\n[63] As in Anchor Pointe, the new argument focused on the one deduction in issue \u2015 the CCA deduction in relation to certain software.\n[64] In Loewen, the exception to the principle that the Minister is bound by the basis on which the assessment was made and cannot appeal the assessment was expanded slightly. In Loewen, there was no change in the law or court decision that prompted the alternative argument. When the taxpayer was assessed, the law was the same as it was at the time of the hearing (and is today) \u2014 if a taxpayer did not (and does not) acquire an asset for the purpose of gaining or producing income, no CCA could (or can) be claimed in relation to that asset.\n[65] Even though the taxpayer was assessed on the basis that he was entitled to claim CCA (albeit less than the amount claimed by the taxpayer), the Minister was allowed to advance an alternative argument that was inconsistent with the assessment. The Minister was allowed to advance the argument that no CCA should have been allowed as a deduction. This alternative argument was again premised on there being no increase in the tax liability of the taxpayer and arose in relation to the particular amount in dispute \u2014 the amount claimed as CCA for particular software. The Minister was effectively granted a limited right of appeal from the assessment as the Minister was allowed to advance an argument that was inconsistent with the basis on which the assessment was issued.\nG. Petro-Canada [66] Shortly after Loewen was issued, Sharlow J.A. (who wrote the reasons for the Court in Loewen) rendered the decision on behalf of the Court in Petro-Canada. Petro-Canada also involved a claim for CEE. Petro-Canada claimed a deduction for CEE which was reduced on reassessment by the Minister. On appeal to the Tax Court, the Minister argued that the expenditures included as CEE did not satisfy the definition of CEE. This argument would mean that no amount could have been deducted as CEE (even though an amount had been allowed as a deduction by the Minister).\n[67] The Tax Court Judge in Petro-Canada, [2002] T.C.J. No. 640, [2003] 2 C.T.C. 2087, found that the amount that had been allowed as a deduction for CEE was greater than the amount that should have been allowed. However, the Tax Court Judge acknowledged that he could not increase the tax liability of Petro-Canada.\n[68] The appeal to the Tax Court included a separate claim for scientific research and experimental development (SRED) expenses that had been disallowed. Prior to the hearing of the appeal at the Tax Court, the parties had agreed that Petro-Canada should be allowed this deduction and they executed a consent to judgment allowing Petro-Canada a deduction of $772,448 for these SRED expenses. The Tax Court Judge refused to allow the additional deduction for the SRED expense. The Tax Court Judge reasoned that since, based on his findings, Petro-Canada had been allowed a claim for CEE that exceeded the amount that it should have been allowed to claim by over $4 million, the additional deduction for SRED expense should not be allowed. Petro-Canada\u2019s appeal to the Tax Court was dismissed.\n[69] On appeal to this Court, Sharlow J.A. acknowledged if no deduction should have been allowed for CEE, the taxes payable by Petro-Canada would be increased. However, the result of an appeal cannot be an increase in the tax liability of the taxpayer:\n[23] In the Tax Court, the Crown argued that the cost of the seismic data purchased by the joint exploration corporations did not meet the statutory definition of \u201cCanadian exploration expense\u201d. If that argument is correct, the cost of the seismic data to the joint exploration corporations did not qualify for renunciation to Petro-Canada, and Petro-Canada should not have been allowed even the $8,884,497 deduction that was the subject of Petro-Canada\u2019s appeal.\n[24] However, the Crown could not and did not argue in the Tax Court that Petro-Canada should be reassessed to disallow the $8,884,497 deduction, because the Crown is not permitted to appeal an assessment: Harris v. Minister of National Revenue, [1965] 2 Ex. C.R. 653, [1964] C.T.C. 562, 64 D.T.C. 5332 (Ex. Ct.), affirmed on other grounds, [1966] S.C.R. 489, [1966] C.T.C. 226, 66 D.T.C. 5189 (S.C.C.). (The record does not disclose the date of the expiry of the normal reassessment period under subsection 152(4) of the Income Tax Act.)\n[70] This Court agreed with the definition of CEE as found by the Tax Court Judge and his other findings related to the CEE in issue. Thus, this Court confirmed that Petro-Canada had been allowed a claim for CEE that exceeded the amount that it should have been allowed to claim.\n[71] However, notwithstanding that Petro-Canada had been allowed a greater deduction for CEE than would be permitted under the Act, this Court found that the Tax Court Judge erred by not allowing Petro-Canada to deduct the SRED expense that was the subject of the consent judgment:\n[68] The Judge was correct when he concluded that Petro-Canada had been allowed a deduction that exceeded its entitlement. The only implication of that conclusion was that the Judge could not grant Petro-Canada the remedy it sought, which was an increased deduction for the cost of the seismic data. The Judge was precluded by Harris from requiring the Minister to reduce the deduction because, in effect, that would allow the Crown to appeal the assessment.\n[69] However, the Judge refused to require the Minister to give effect to the consent judgment. Refusing Petro-Canada\u2019s rightful claim to the deduction for scientific research and experimental development had the same effect as an order allowing that claim but reducing Petro-Canada\u2019s seismic expense deduction by the same amount. It is as though the Judge had allowed, in part, the Crown\u2019s appeal of the seismic data deduction. The Judge was doing indirectly what he could not have done directly. In my view, the Judge erred in failing to give effect to the consent judgment.\n[72] As a result, Petro-Canada was able to deduct the amount of CEE that the Minister had allowed in reassessing Petro-Canada and the SRED expense that the parties had agreed should be allowed as a deduction. These were two separate transactions: the transactions that resulted in the SRED expense and the transactions on which the claim for CEE was based. The Minister could not defend the amount of taxes payable as a result of the reassessment by arguing that even though Petro-Canada was entitled to the SRED expense, this additional deduction was more than offset by the additional CEE that should not have been allowed as a deduction.\n[73] As in Anchor Pointe and Loewen, the Minister was permitted to raise an argument that was inconsistent with the basis of the assessment. Since Petro-Canada had been allowed to deduct CEE (albeit less than the amount it had claimed), the argument that it was not entitled to deduct any amount for CEE was inconsistent with the basis of the assessment which had allowed an amount for CEE. The argument was related to the same seismic data that was in dispute.\nH. Walsh [74] In Walsh, the taxpayers were reassessed to include certain amounts in their income arising as a result of the exercise of certain stock options to acquire shares in Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and Bresea Resources Ltd. The taxpayers, in their notices of appeal to the Tax Court, alleged that they were not residents of Canada. In the initial replies filed by the Minister, the Minister relied on sections 5 and 7 and subsection 2(1) of the Act on the assumption that the taxpayers were residents of Canada. The Minister subsequently sought to amend the replies to include paragraph 115(1)(a) of the Act (which would be applicable if the taxpayers were not residents of Canada).\n[75] The amendments were allowed. This Court emphasized that, based on paragraph 40 of Anchor Pointe, the Minister was not attempting to introduce a new transaction. Rather, the Minister was simply raising an additional argument in support of the taxes as assessed, in the event the taxpayers were not residents of Canada:\n[13] Through the reliance on paragraph 115(1)(a) of the Act, which deal [sic] with taxable income earned in Canada by non-residents, the Minister is not seeking to increase the amount of the appellants\u2019 income that was not included in an assessment or reassessment made within the normal period. Rather, the Minister is seeking to support exactly the same amount of tax liability flowing from the same Stock Option Benefits as assessed to the appellants, with an additional argument.\n[76] In Walsh, this Court identified the following conditions related to subsection 152(9) of the Act:\n[18] The following conditions apply when the Minister seeks to rely on subsection 152(9) of the Act:\n1) the Minister cannot include transactions which did not form the basis of the taxpayer\u2019s reassessment;\n2) the right of the Minister to present an alternative argument in support of an assessment is subject to paragraphs 152(9)(a) and (b), which speak to the prejudice to the taxpayer; and\n3) the Minister cannot use subsection 152(9) to reassess outside the time limitations in subsection 152(4) of the Act, or to collect tax exceeding the amount in the assessment under appeal.\nI. Last [77] In Last, there were a number of issues related to various activities of the taxpayer. One issue related to the gain realized on the disposition of the shares of InternetStudios.com, Inc. (ISTO). The taxpayer was assessed on the basis that the gain that he realized on the disposition of these shares was a capital gain. On appeal to the Tax Court, the taxpayer took the unusual position of arguing that the gain on these shares was an income gain and not a capital gain. The taxpayer was claiming that he had incurred expenses that would reduce the income arising from the sale of shares.\n[78] After finding that the taxpayer was not entitled to a deduction for the payments that he had claimed, the Tax Court Judge found that the taxpayer\u2019s position that the gain on the disposition of the shares was an income gain \u201cappears to be amply supported by the evidence\u201d (paragraph 48).\n[79] The Minister argued that the Tax Court could order the Minister to reassess the taxpayer on the basis that the gain realized on the disposition of the shares was an income gain so long as the total amount of taxes assessed for 2002 did not exceed the amount of the assessment under appeal (paragraph 49).\n[80] The Tax Court Judge concluded that she could not grant the requested order:\n[51] In my view, it is not appropriate for the Court to require a reassessment that changes the character of the gains from capital to income, because the effect of this would be for the Minister to reassess beyond the limitation period set out in s. 152(4) and (4.01) of the ITA.\n[52] The applicable principle applies equally to a new basis of assessment and a new argument pursuant to s. 152(9).\n[emphasis added]\n[81] It should also be noted that in paragraph 52 of the Tax Court Judge\u2019s reasons the Tax Court Judge refers to a new basis and a new argument in relation to subsection 152(9) of the Act even though, at that time, subsection 152(9) only referred to an alternative argument.\n[82] The decision of the Tax Court was upheld on appeal. This Court based its decision on Petro-Canada:\n[31] In my view, Petro-Canada is dispositive of the Crown\u2019s appeal in this case. The Minister originally assessed the taxpayer\u2019s proceeds from the sale of the ISTO shares as a capital gain. By characterizing the proceeds as a capital gain, the Minister set the taxpayer\u2019s liability from the source of income that was the ISTO shares. The Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the proceeds of disposition were on account of income, not property, could not result in an increase of the taxpayer\u2019s liability from that source because the Minister cannot appeal from her own assessment.\n[32] Put another way, the proceeds of disposition on the sale of the ISTO shares were $601,135. Treating the transaction as being on account of business income would increase the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income by approximately $300,565. Had the Tax Court simply dismissed the taxpayer\u2019s appeal, the taxpayer would have been deprived of additional, unrelated deductions of $265,070. The effect would be to increase the taxpayer\u2019s income by the difference between $300,565 and $265,070. This is inconsistent with the principle that the Minister cannot appeal from her own assessment.\n[83] The reference to \u201cunrelated deductions of $265,070\u201d is presumably to other deductions either allowed by the Tax Court Judge or by the Minister, on consent, that were not related to the sale of the shares.\nJ. Application of the Prior Version of subsection 152(9) of the Act in this appeal [84] In interpreting and applying subsection 152(9) of the Act, the Tax Court and this Court have balanced the right of the Minister to raise an alternative argument against the principles that the Minister cannot appeal an assessment and the Minister cannot reassess after the expiration of the normal reassessment period, absent a misstatement as contemplated by subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) of the Act or a waiver as contemplated by subparagraph 152(4)(b)(i) of the Act. The concern is that since the Minister cannot reassess after the expiration of the normal reassessment period, the Minister should not be allowed to do indirectly what the Minister cannot do directly. These Courts have rejected the proposition that the Minister can raise any argument or basis in support of an assessment so long as the tax liability of the taxpayer is not increased.\n[85] This Court has not allowed the Minister to raise a new argument based on a transaction that did not form the basis on which a taxpayer was assessed. When the Minister attempted to support an assessment of tax by denying a taxpayer a right to a deduction (to which the taxpayer was entitled and which would have reduced the amount of tax payable) by arguing that the taxpayer had received the benefit of another unrelated deduction that exceeded the amount that should have been allowed, this Court has not allowed the Minister to offset the two amounts. In those cases, there was also no dispute that the taxpayer was entitled to the other deductions.\n[86] In this case, the allegation of the Minister is that it is the same equipment that resulted in the CCA claim and in the deduction for the cost of goods sold. If the particular equipment was not sold, TPine would be entitled to CCA as claimed. However, if TPine claimed an amount as the cost of goods sold for this same equipment, it would follow that TPine cannot claim an amount as cost of goods sold for goods that were not sold. Whether it is the same equipment that resulted in the CCA claimed and on which cost of goods sold was also claimed is a matter for the Tax Court to determine.\n[87] This Court has also confirmed that the Minister is not barred from making an argument in support of an assessment that is contrary to the position taken by the Minister in assessing a taxpayer. In Anchor Pointe, Loewen, and Petro-Canada the Minister was allowed to make an argument that would result in no amount being deductible for CEE (in Anchor Pointe and Petro-Canada) or CCA (in Loewen), even though an amount had been allowed for CEE or CCA in assessing these taxpayers. The claim for CEE or CCA was in issue before the Courts and, in particular, the amount included for certain seismic data in determining CEE was in issue in Anchor Pointe and Petro-Canada and the amount included for certain software in determining CCA was in issue in Loewen.\n[88] In this matter, the issue is whether TPine sold the particular assets on which CCA was claimed. The consequences that would flow from finding that TPine had not sold these assets are a finding that the claim for CCA was a valid claim and no amount should have been claimed for the cost of goods sold (if it was the same equipment). Both consequences flow from the same \u201ctransaction\u201d \u2014 the retention (and not a sale) \u2014 of the same assets. The allowance of a deduction for cost of goods sold in this case would not preclude the Minister from making an argument that no amount should have been allowed as a deduction for cost of goods sold for the same equipment for which a claim for CCA had been denied, subject to the general restriction that the tax liability of TPine cannot be increased from the amount as assessed.\nVI. Conclusion [89] As a result, in my view, the Minister would have been allowed to make this alternative argument based on the prior version of subsection 152(9) of the Act and since the amendments would not restrict the Minister from making this argument, the proposed amendments to the reply should be allowed.\n[90] To what extent the amendments to subsection 152(9) of the Act would allow the Minister to advance an alternative basis or argument will be decided on a case-by-case basis. The principles that the Minister cannot appeal an assessment and the Minister cannot reassess beyond the expiration of the normal reassessment period are still valid principles that would need to be taken into account in determining what alternative basis or argument the Minister may advance. In interpreting and applying the previous version of subsection 152(9) of the Act, this Court has also limited an alternative argument to the same transaction that is in dispute. It is not clear how the amendments would alter this principle.\n[91] I would dismiss this appeal, with costs.\n\u201cWyman W. Webb\u201d\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nDonald J.

Overview [1] This decision concerns a motion by the appellant, Canadian National Railway Company (CN), for an Order staying the Federal Court decision at issue in the present appeal until this Court renders a final judgment thereon.\n[2] The respondents Canada (Minister of the Environment) and the Attorney General of Canada consent to CN\u2019s motion.\n[3] The respondents the Regional Municipality of Halton, the Corporation of the Town of Milton, the Corporation of the Town of Halton Hills, the Corporation of the City of Burlington, the Corporation of the Town of Oakville and the Halton Region Conservation Authority (the Halton Region Respondents) oppose the motion. Importantly, their responding motion record includes an affidavit of Dr. Rakesh Singh, which addresses motor vehicle emissions that will result if the stay is granted.\n[4] CN has submitted a reply motion record in which it has included, in addition to its reply written representations, an affidavit by Allan Prits responding to Dr. Singh\u2019s affidavit. This reply motion record was accompanied by a letter in which CN recognizes that it does not have a right to adduce affidavit evidence in reply, and seeks leave of the Court in that regard. The Halton Region Respondents oppose this leave request, which gives rise to a separate issue that I will address before I consider the merits of the stay motion.\nII. Background [5] In 2021, following a six-year approval process, CN began construction of a large terminal on its land in Milton, Ontario that will facilitate the transfer of standard-sized (intermodal) containers between rail cars and trucks (the Project).\n[6] The Halton Region Respondents commenced an application for judicial review of three decisions that led to approval of the Project. On March 1, 2024, the Federal Court (2024 FC 348, per Justice Henry S. Brown) granted the application in respect of two of the impugned decisions, setting them aside and remanding them for redetermination. The Federal Court\u2019s decision brought a stop to CN\u2019s construction of the Project.\n[7] CN has since appealed the Federal Court\u2019s decision, and brought the present motion for a stay.\nIII. Legal Test for Stay Pending Appeal [8] Paragraph 50(1)(b) of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, provides the authority for this Court to grant a stay where \u201cit is in the interest of justice that the proceedings be stayed.\u201d Rule 398(1)(b) of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106 (the Rules), provides that, \u201c[o]n the motion of a person against whom an order has been made, \u2026 (b) where a notice of appeal of the order has been issued, a judge of the court that is to hear the appeal may order that it be stayed.\u201d\n[9] The parties agree that the legal test applicable to CN\u2019s stay motion is as contemplated in RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311, 111 D.L.R. (4th) 385 (RJR-MacDonald). The moving party must establish (i) a serious question to be tried, (ii) that it will suffer irreparable harm if the stay is not granted, and (iii) that the balance of convenience favours granting the stay.\n[10] The threshold for establishing a serious question to be tried is generally a low one. The Court must be satisfied that the appeal is not frivolous or vexatious: RJR-MacDonald at 348.\n[11] With regard to irreparable harm, the moving party must adduce clear, compelling and non-speculative evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that it will suffer \u201charm which either cannot be quantified in monetary terms or which cannot be cured\u201d: RJR-MacDonald at 341; Sheldon M. Chumir Foundation for Ethics in Leadership v. Canada (National Revenue), 2023 FCA 242 at paras. 6\u20138. The Supreme Court of Canada in RJR- MacDonald had additional comments concerning harm to the public interest at page 346:\nIn the case of a public authority, the onus of demonstrating irreparable harm to the public interest is less than that of a private applicant. This is partly a function of the nature of the public authority and partly a function of the action sought to be enjoined. The test will nearly always be satisfied simply upon proof that the authority is charged with the duty of promoting or protecting the public interest and upon some indication that the impugned legislation, regulation, or activity was undertaken pursuant to that responsibility. Once these minimal requirements have been met, the court should in most cases assume that irreparable harm to the public interest would result from the restraint of that action.\n[12] The issue of the balance of convenience involves \u201ca determination of which of the two parties will suffer the greater harm from the granting or refusal of an interlocutory injunction, pending a decision on the merits\u201d: RJR-MacDonald at 342.\nIV. Affidavit Evidence in Reply [13] As alluded to above, I cannot consider CN\u2019s reply until I have resolved the dispute over its content.\n[14] The parties agree that the decision in Amgen Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2016 FCA 121, 266 A.C.W.S. (3d) 12, is helpful on the subject of reply evidence in a motion. The Rules do not provide for reply evidence in a motion, but the Federal Courts have discretion to admit such evidence by virtue of:\nRule 55, which permits varying a rule in special circumstances;\nRule 3, which provides that the Rules are to be applied so as to secure the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every proceeding on its merits;\nRule 4, often called the gap rule, which permits reference to other rules when a procedural matter is not provided for in the Rules (Rule 312, which provides for the filing of additional affidavits in the context of an application, may be helpful); and\nThe plenary powers of the Federal Courts to regulate its procedures.\n[15] CN recognizes that it must establish unusual circumstances to be allowed to rely on its reply evidence. Relevant considerations are procedural fairness and the need to make a proper determination.\n[16] CN argues that consideration of its reply evidence, Mr. Prits\u2019s affidavit, is necessary because Dr. Singh\u2019s affidavit relies on out of date modelling and incorrect measures of emissions as they relate to human health in asserting that continued construction of the Project would cause significant safety risks. CN also argues that it could not have reasonably anticipated that the Halton Region Respondents would put in evidence that raises these concerns.\n[17] The Halton Region Respondents respond that CN has failed to demonstrate unusual circumstances. They argue that CN cannot show that Dr. Singh\u2019s affidavit (dealing with the harmful consequences of a resumption of construction of the Project) raises new issues since the goal of CN\u2019s motion is the resumption of construction.\n[18] I agree with the Halton Region Respondents. Though CN might not have been able to anticipate the precise nature of the Halton Region Respondents\u2019 evidence in response to the stay motion, it should have expected some evidence concerning the environmental impacts of resuming construction of the Project, including emissions arising therefrom. CN elected not to adduce evidence in chief in this regard, and to rely instead on an argument that, during the pendency of the judicial review proceeding before the Federal Court, the Halton Region Respondents had acted in a manner that suggested that they did not consider emissions from construction to be an important issue. Moreover, with regard to CN\u2019s concern that Dr. Singh relied on information that was out of date, it can state its position in argument; it need not have reference to reply evidence.\n[19] I will order CN\u2019s reply written submissions to be filed (together with the accompanying book of authorities and proof of service), but I will exclude Mr. Prits\u2019s affidavit. Fortunately, CN prepared its reply written representations with a clear indication of which portion thereof concerns Mr. Prits\u2019s affidavit. Accordingly, it is not necessary to require that CN prepare and file amended reply written representations. I will simply consider CN\u2019s existing reply written representations as if paragraph 36 thereof was not included.\nV. Analysis A. Serious Issue [20] Since this proceeding involves an appeal of a decision on an application for judicial review, the standard of review to be applied by this Court will be as described in Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559 at para. 45. This Court will consider (i) whether the Federal Court selected the correct standard(s) of review of the impugned decisions, and (ii) whether the Federal Court correctly applied that(those) standard(s) of review. This Court will effectively step into the shoes of the Federal Court, and focus on the administrative decisions in issue.\n[21] The Federal Court selected a standard of review of reasonableness, and found that the two decisions in issue in the appeal were unreasonable. Unless a party takes issue with applying the reasonableness standard of review, this Court\u2019s task will be to consider whether those decisions were indeed unreasonable.\n[22] Given the low threshold for establishing a serious question, and in view of the issues raised in the notice of appeal and the fact that reasonableness is a deferential standard of review, I am convinced that CN has met this part of the test for a stay.\nB. Irreparable Harm [23] CN argues that it will suffer irreparable harm if the stay is not granted. It also argues that the public interest likewise stands to suffer irreparable harm.\n[24] With regard to CN, it argues that it will have to bear irreparable costs in relation to (i) preparing the construction site for shutdown, (ii) monitoring the site during the shutdown, (iii) protecting it from environmental harm during that time, and (iv) in the event that the appeal is successful, preparing for resumption of construction. CN also argues that there will be an irrecoverable loss of profits because of the delay in completing the Project.\n[25] With regard to the public interest, CN cites the irreparable harm resulting from the delay in completion of the Project, as approved by the public authorities in the impugned decisions.\n[26] The Halton Region Respondents take issue with the quality of CN\u2019s evidence concerning the irreparable financial harm it stands to suffer if the stay is not granted. Regardless of the quality of that evidence, however, I find it difficult to imagine that CN will not suffer some irreparable harm. While it is reasonable to scrutinize the amounts of money at stake as alleged by CN, it seems clear that CN will have to incur some costs in each of the categories noted in paragraph 24 above, and that those costs will not be recoverable.\n[27] The Halton Region Respondents argue that CN engaged in its construction activities to date despite the ongoing judicial review application, and hence CN incurred the costs of construction at its own peril. The Halton Region Respondents argue that these costs were avoidable and are therefore not irreparable.\n[28] I hesitate to criticize CN for commencing construction of the Project, even in the face of legal proceedings, after it had obtained the necessary government approvals following six years of efforts in that regard. Certainly, it took a risk that the judicial review would be successful, but this does not alter the fact that it stands to suffer irreparable harm if the stay is not granted and its appeal is ultimately successful.\nC. Balance of Convenience [29] The Halton Region Respondents argue that the balance of convenience favours refusing to grant a stay. Specifically, they argue that:\nThe emissions that would result from continued construction of the Project have not been addressed in CN\u2019s motion materials, and they would be significant;\nDemand for the additional intermodal facilities that would be offered by the Project is lower than CN argues;\nCN is a large company acting in its private interest, and continuing the construction halt until a decision on its appeal would have a negligible, and purely financial, effect on its business; and\nCN\u2019s submission that the public interest favours granting a stay are speculative and unsupported.\n(1) Emissions from Construction [30] As indicated above, with regard to emissions resulting from continued construction of the Project, the Halton Region Respondents rely on the evidence of Dr. Singh. He analyzed the effects of such emissions relying on the 2015 Environmental Impact Statement that CN submitted to the Environmental Review Panel (the Panel), which was tasked with considering the relative merits of the Project.\n[31] In its reply written representations, CN notes that the data in the 2015 Environmental Impact Statement is out of date, and the Panel relied on updated data and modelling. The Panel and the Decision Statement that followed also imposed air quality mitigations not mentioned in the 2015 Statement. CN also notes that the Halton Region Respondents know that the data in the 2015 Statement is out of date. Further, CN takes issue with Dr. Singh\u2019s focus on the total amount of emissions without providing information about how they would be dispersed in the atmosphere. Such information would be useful to assess human exposure to the emissions.\n[32] The Halton Region Respondents argue that CN\u2019s failure to address emissions during construction of the Project is \u201chighly peculiar\u201d. However, it does not strike me as peculiar. As mentioned at paragraph 18 above, CN explains why it did not address this category of emissions, arguing that the Halton Region Respondents\u2019 conduct following commencement of the judicial review proceeding suggested relatively little concern about construction emissions. Effectively, CN asks this Court to infer this lack of concern from the failure of the Halton Region Respondents to seek a stay of construction of the Project during the three years between commencement of the judicial review proceeding and the Federal Court\u2019s decision thereon.\n[33] I agree with CN that Dr. Singh\u2019s evidence is based principally on data from the 2015 Environmental Impact Statement, and this data seems indeed to be out of date. While I recognize that there will indeed be increased emissions resulting from the resumption of construction of the Project if the stay is granted, I do not have reliable evidence as to the degree of harmful effects therefrom. I am prepared to infer that emissions from construction activities were not top of mind for the Halton Region Respondents during the judicial review proceeding before the Federal Court. They sought neither to stop construction pending judicial review, nor to expedite the proceeding.\n(2) Demand for Intermodal Facilities [34] I turn now to the Halton Region Respondents\u2019 argument that the demand for the Project is lower than CN argues. Here, the Halton Region Respondents rely on the affidavit of John Vickerman. He questioned the figures provided by CN\u2019s witness, Darren Reynolds, concerning the capacity of existing intermodal facilities and the expected demand in the future. The Halton Region Respondents argue that intermodal volumes are actually declining, and that CN\u2019s forecast for demand is based on old numbers. They assert that cargo carried by Canadian railways dropped 8.5% from January 2023 to January 2024.\n[35] In reply, CN notes that its figures are more reliable since they are specific to CN\u2019s business and they are more consistent with the findings of the Panel. At page 288 of its report dated January 27, 2020, the Panel observed as follows:\nThe Panel believes that CN, port authorities, transport companies and other parties involved in supply chain management made a convincing case that, as long as current rates of growth continue, there is a need for additional intermodal terminal capacity in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area.\n[36] I agree with CN that I should give more weight to its evidence, which is consistent with the Panel\u2019s findings, than to that of the Halton Region Respondents, which suggests not only that demand for intermodal facilities is not growing at the rate that CN suggests, but that it is actually dropping. I am dubious of any suggestion of reduced demand for the Project over the medium or long term. In my view, CN and the Panel are better placed to assess demand for intermodal facilities.\n(3) Consequences to CN of Refusing Stay [37] The Halton Region Respondents argue that a continued stoppage of construction on the Project pending appeal will have no effect on CN\u2019s long-term viability, its market share or its business reputation. Even if CN stands to suffer harm that is irreparable if the stay is not granted, it does not amount to an existential risk. The Halton Region Respondents also argue that this Court should not accept that CN is acting in anything other than its own private interests.\n[38] I agree with the Halton Region Respondents\u2019 arguments. However, they do not alter the fact that the government bodies tasked with assessing the Project in the public interest have given it permission to proceed. Based on that, it would seem that the public interest favours granting the stay to permit construction of the Project to proceed.\n(4) Whether CN\u2019s Submissions Concerning the Public Interest are Speculative and Unsupported [39] The Halton Region Respondents challenge CN\u2019s assertions concerning the harm to the public interest that will result from further delay in construction of the Project. They criticize CN\u2019s evidence in this regard.\n[40] As indicated, the government bodies tasked with assessing the Project concluded that it is in the public interest after weighing the competing evidence. Despite the Federal Court\u2019s decision granting judicial review, that is strong evidence of the public interest in the Project. Moreover, it is axiomatic, in my view, that any delay in completion of a project that is in the public interest is detrimental to the public interest.\n(5) Conclusion on Balance of Convenience [41] There will certainly be some negative effects if the stay is granted, and construction of the Project resumes, in the event that the present appeal is ultimately dismissed. Principal of these is increased emissions from construction activities. These increased emissions will clearly have some effect on the population located near the Project, though the extent of this effect is unclear.\n[42] These negative effects of granting the stay must be balanced against the negative effects of not granting it. As indicated above, these include necessary measures related to the shutdown of the construction site, as well as possible reopening later if the appeal is successful. In addition, the public interest appears to favour the Project, and with a minimum of delay.\n[43] In my view, the balance of convenience favours granting the stay. The evidence provided by the Halton Region Respondents concerning emissions from construction activities appears to be out of date. The Panel considered more recent information when it prepared its report, which led to permission to proceed with the Project. The harmful effects of construction emissions appear to be outweighed by the costs to CN of suspending its construction activities, and more importantly, the public interest in the completion of the Project.\nVI. Conclusion [44] I will grant CN\u2019s motion for a stay of the Federal Court\u2019s decision until this Court renders a final judgment on the present appeal. The costs of this motion shall be in the cause.\n\"George R.

The Order found her in contempt: 2024 FC 48.\n[2] The background to the contempt decision starts with the removal of Councillors Terrina Bellegarde and Joellen Haywahe from the Carry the Kettle First Nation (CTKFN) Council in late 2022. Councillors Bellegarde and Haywahe are challenging their removal in judicial review applications in the Federal Court. The applications have been heard, but the Federal Court has not released its decision.\n[3] On January 27, 2023, Councillors Bellegarde and Haywahe obtained an order from the Federal Court (per Grammond J.) staying their removal and also staying a by-election scheduled to fill their seats, pending resolution of the judicial review applications: 2023 FC 129. The stay order was not appealed.\n[4] Notwithstanding the stay order, the by-election was held; Brady O\u2019Watch and Morris Pasap were elected as councillors. Councillors Bellegarde and Haywahe then brought a motion in the Federal Court for an order finding the appellant, Chief Scott Eashappie, Councillors Shawn Spencer and Tamara Thomson, and Brady O\u2019Watch and Morris Pasap in contempt of the stay order. (In these reasons, I refer to Councillors Bellegarde and Haywahe as councillors, but not Messrs. O\u2019Watch and Pasap, although their status will be addressed in the underlying judicial review applications.)\n[5] On January 15, 2024, the Federal Court found the appellant, Chief Eashappie, and Councillors Spencer and Thomson (together, the contemnors) to be in contempt of the stay order, but not Messrs. O\u2019Watch and Pasap. The Federal Court ordered that the matter be referred to the judicial administrator to set a date for a sentencing hearing. The hearing has not yet occurred.\n[6] Councillor Musqua has appealed her contempt conviction to this Court. The other contemnors have not. Now Councillor Musqua seeks to stay the sentencing hearing pending resolution of her conviction appeal. She says she meets the tripartite test for a stay in RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311.\n[7] For the following reasons, the appellant\u2019s motion will be dismissed.\n[8] Paragraph 398(1)(b) of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106 permits this Court to stay an order that is under appeal. The test for obtaining a stay is set out in RJR-MacDonald. Moving parties must establish that: (1) their appeal raises a serious issue; (2) they will suffer irreparable harm if the stay is not granted; and (3) the balance of convenience favours granting the stay: RJR-MacDonald at 334; Canada v. Canadian Council for Refugees, 2008 FCA 40 at para. 18. All three criteria must be met for a stay to be issued.\n[9] The threshold for determining whether there is a serious issue is low: RJR-MacDonald at 335; Western Oilfield Equipment Rentals Ltd. v. M-I L.L.C., 2020 FCA 3 at para. 8. The test is met where there is at least one issue to be determined on appeal that is \u201cnot frivolous or vexatious\u201d: RJR-MacDonald at 337; Toronto Real Estate Board v. Commissioner of Competition, 2016 FCA 204 at para. 11; Canadian Council for Refugees at para. 22.\n[10] Councillor Musqua claims that her appeal raises a number of serious issues, including whether the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard for establishing contempt was met and whether the Federal Court judge relied on evidence that was not applicable to her and failed to consider evidence that was. She also claims ineffective representation by counsel and that the Federal Court judge erred in refusing to re-open the contempt proceedings.\n[11] The respondents essentially argue that Councillor Musqua\u2019s appeal lacks merit. However, on a stay motion, the Court\u2019s view on the appeal\u2019s chances of success is irrelevant: RJR-MacDonald at 338; Western Oilfield at para. 8.\n[12] The question at this stage is whether Councillor Musqua has raised at least one issue on appeal that is neither frivolous nor vexatious. I am satisfied that she has met this low threshold. The \u201cserious issue\u201d branch of the test is satisfied.\n[13] Under the second branch of the RJR-MacDonald test, Councillor Musqua must show that she would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted. \u201cIrreparable\u201d refers to the nature of the harm, not the magnitude. It is harm that cannot be quantified in monetary terms or remedied through compensation: RJR-MacDonald at 341.\n[14] Although the alleged harm in an RJR-MacDonald analysis is necessarily future harm, it cannot be \u201chypothetical and speculative\u201d: Janssen Inc. v. Abbvie Corporation, 2014 FCA 112 at para. 24. There must be \u201ca real probability\u201d of irreparable harm that cannot be avoided: Bell Canada v. Beanfield Technologies Inc., 2024 FCA 28 at para. 21, and the cases cited therein.\n[15] Councillor Musqua submits that the sentencing hearing would generate irreparable harm because of the potentially serious penalties for contempt, including imprisonment, which could negatively impact her livelihood and infringe her civil liberties. She also argues that the sentencing hearing would cause further, irreparable harm to her reputation.\n[16] I do not accept these submissions. I am unable to conclude that the sentencing hearing itself would cause harm to Councillor Musqua\u2019s reputation incremental to that arising from the Federal Court\u2019s finding of contempt. Further, I do not accept that the mere possibility of a penalty of imprisonment constitutes irreparable harm.\n[17] The Federal Court has discretion to choose from a wide range of penalties for a person found to be in contempt. They are set out in rule 472 of the Federal Courts Rules and include imprisonment (rule 472(a) and (b)), a fine (rule 472(c)), an order to refrain from doing any act (rule 472(d)), and an order to pay costs (rule 472(f)). The Federal Court must ultimately fashion a sentence that is proportional in the circumstances: Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada v. Bremsak, 2013 FCA 214 at paras. 29 and 33. Sometimes a warning along with criticism in reasons for judgment is good enough. Not all of these penalties would constitute irreparable harm.\n[18] Until the Federal Court determines the appropriate sanction, I do not know what harm Councillor Musqua will suffer and therefore cannot determine if the harm is irreparable. The Ontario Court of Appeal similarly held in Sabourin and Sun Group of Companies v. Laiken, 2011 ONCA 757. That Court concluded that the motion to stay a contempt order prior to the sentencing hearing was premature: Sabourin at para. 7. The Court did not accept that the mere risk of being sent to jail qualified as irreparable harm: Sabourin at para. 13.\n[19] Even accepting that a risk of imprisonment may constitute irreparable harm, it is potentially avoidable. If the Federal Court were to order imprisonment at the sentencing hearing, Councillor Musqua could immediately appeal the order to this Court and seek a stay of the sentence. This Court could then assess the merits of a stay application with a complete picture of the harm she faces, as is recommended in Sabourin at para. 13. It may also be possible for Councillor Musqua to ask the Federal Court to adjourn her sentencing hearing until after the appeal is heard: Canada (Attorney General) v. Oshkosh Defense Canada Inc., 2018 FCA 102 at para. 24; Hama v. Werbes, 1999 BCCA 714 at para. 3.\n[20] At this point, the harm alleged by Councillor Musqua is hypothetical, speculative, and avoidable. The \u201cirreparable harm\u201d criterion for the issuance of a stay is not met.\n[21] The third step of the RJR-MacDonald test, the \u201cbalance of convenience\u201d, involves a comparison of the harm to the responding party from granting the stay and the harm to the moving party from refusing to grant the stay, pending a decision on the merits: RJR-MacDonald at 342; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Canadian Council of Refugees, 2020 FCA 181 at para. 10. As the RJR-MacDonald test is conjunctive, and Councillor Musqua has not satisfied the second step of the test, it is unnecessary for me to consider the balance of convenience: Janssen at para. 14; Western Oilfield at para. 7.\n[22] In any case, in these circumstances, I would be reluctant to intervene in the Federal Court\u2019s contempt proceeding, which does not conclude until a sanction has been determined. While within this Court\u2019s power to order a stay, it is generally preferable not to interrupt proceedings in the trial court if the consequence is to fragment the appeals: Sabourin at para. 7; Hama at para. 3. The sanction for contempt, while determined in a separate hearing, will reflect the Federal Court\u2019s views of the seriousness of the contempt, which is potentially relevant to this Court\u2019s full appreciation of the matter under appeal.\n[23] For the foregoing reasons, the motion for a stay will be dismissed, with costs in the all-inclusive amount of $2,500.\n\u201cMonica Biringer\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-29-24\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nLUCY MUSQUA v.

Overview [1] The appellants appeal from a judgment of the Federal Court, which dismissed two applications for judicial review: 2021 FC 1367 [FC Decision]. The first application challenged the validity of a report resulting from a regional assessment of offshore oil and gas exploratory drilling, conducted under the Impact Assessment Act, S.C. 2019, c. 28 (Act). The second application sought to quash a regulation made under the Act that exempts certain exploratory drilling activities from a number of impact assessment requirements.\n[2] After our Court heard this appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision on the constitutionality of the Act: Reference re Impact Assessment Act, 2023 SCC 23 [IAA Reference]. The Supreme Court opined that the federal impact assessment scheme, consisting of the Act and its accompanying Physical Activities Regulations, S.O.R.\/2019-285 (Activities Regs), is unconstitutional in part.\n[3] For the following reasons, which take into account the IAA Reference, I would dismiss the appeal.\nII. Background A. Legislative Background [4] The IAA Reference provides a thorough analysis of the federal impact assessment scheme found in the Act and the Activities Regs. The following summary highlights the provisions relevant to this appeal. Unless otherwise stated, all legislative references are to the Act. For ease of reference, the relevant legislative provisions are reproduced in the annex of these reasons.\n[5] The Act and the Activities Regs form part of a regulatory scheme for assessing and safeguarding against the adverse effects of physical activities on the environment, or on health, social or economic conditions and their ensuing consequences. Other stated purposes of this scheme include (1) fostering sustainability; (2) ensuring respect for the rights of Indigenous peoples; (3) establishing a fair, predictable, and efficient impact assessment process that creates opportunities for sustainable economic development; (4) ensuring that decisions are based on science, Indigenous knowledge, and other sources of evidence; and (5) assessing cumulative effects within a region: see Preamble, section 6.\n(1) Designated Projects [6] One way of safeguarding against the adverse effects of physical activities is the identification of \u201cdesignated projects\u201d either in the Activities Regs or in ministerial orders: see section 2, subsection 9(1), and paragraph 109(b). If a proponent wishes to carry out a designated project, but the project may cause one of the effects listed under subsection 7(1), a project-specific impact assessment may be required: subsections 7(1) and (3). Offshore exploratory drilling is one type of designated project listed in the Activities Regs: section 2 of the Activities Regs and section 34 of the Activities Regs\u2019 Schedule. The impact assessment process for designated projects contains three main phases: the planning phase, the impact assessment phase, and the decision-making phase. I will briefly explain each phase.\n(a) Planning Phase [7] After the proponent of a designated project has provided the required information to the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada (Agency), the Agency decides whether the project requires an impact assessment: sections 10\u201316. An affirmative decision triggers the impact assessment process: IAA Reference at paras. 38\u201341.\n(b) Impact Assessment Phase [8] Either the Agency or a review panel carries on the assessment. The assessment considers the proposed project\u2019s potential environmental, health, social, and economic impacts, including the project\u2019s benefits: sections 18, 22, 41, 42. The Agency or review panel uses the gathered information to develop an impact assessment report: sections 28, 51; IAA Reference at paras. 42\u201345.\n(c) Decision-Making Phase [9] The decision maker can be either the Minister of the Environment (Minister) or the Governor in Council (Governor). The Governor becomes the decision maker when a review panel conducts the assessment or when the Minister refers the decision to the Governor: sections 60\u201362. The decision maker, after considering the impact assessment report, determines whether \u201cthe adverse effects within federal jurisdiction\u2014and the adverse direct or incidental effects\u2014that are indicated in the report are [\u2026] in the public interest\u201d: paragraphs 60(1)(a) and (b). If so, the Minister establishes conditions that he considers appropriate with which the proponent of the designated project must comply: section 64; IAA Reference at para. 46.\n(2) Regional Assessment Mechanism [10] In the case of multiple designated projects that are or will possibly be carried out in the same area, the Act provides for a regional assessment mechanism that may result in these projects being exempted from project-specific impact assessments. This regional assessment mechanism, like the scheme governing designated projects, contains three phases: planning, assessment, and decision-making.\n(a) Planning Phase [11] Sections 92 and 93 allow the Minister, alone or together with the government of a province, to appoint a committee or ask the Agency to conduct a regional assessment. The Minister must establish the committee\u2019s terms of reference and appoint one or more persons as members of the committee: subsection 96(1).\n(b) Assessment Phase\n[12] Once a committee is appointed, the following rules are relevant to the conduct of the regional assessment:\n\u2022The committee must take into account any scientific information and Indigenous knowledge provided with respect to the assessment (subsection 97(2));\n\u2022The committee must ensure that the information it uses when conducting the assessment is made available to the public (section 98);\n\u2022The committee must ensure that the public is provided with an opportunity to participate meaningfully in the assessment (section 99); and\n\u2022Upon completing the assessment, the Committee must provide a report to the Minister. The report must demonstrate how the Indigenous knowledge provided was taken into account and used in the regional assessment (section 102).\n(c) Decision-Making Phase [13] After considering a regional assessment, the Minister may make a regulation to exempt physical activities in a specified area from undergoing project-specific assessments if those projects meet the conditions prescribed in the regulation: paragraph 112(1)(a.2), subsection 112(2), and section 112.1 of the Act.\n[14] The Minister opted for this regional assessment mechanism in the case at bar, which involves offshore exploratory drilling activities in a defined area east of Newfoundland and Labrador (Study Area).\nB. Factual Background [15] The facts in this appeal can be neatly summarized according to the three phases of the regional assessment.\n(1) Planning Phase [16] In March 2019, the Government of Canada, the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB) signed an Agreement (Agreement) to conduct a Regional Assessment of Offshore Oil and Gas Exploratory Drilling East of Newfoundland and Labrador (Regional Assessment): Agreement, Appeal Book at 123\u2013137.\n[17] The Agreement defined the Regional Assessment as a \u201cstudy or assessment of the effects of existing or future physical activities carried out in a region\u201d, and prescribed the factors to be considered in the assessment: Agreement, definition of \u201cRegional Assessment\u201d and Appendix A, Appeal Book, at 124, 131, 132.\n[18] The Agreement established a five-member committee (Committee) to conduct the Regional Assessment: Agreement, definition of \u201cCommittee\u201d and clause 3.1, Appeal Book, at 125. The Committee\u2019s Terms of Reference, listed in the Agreement, outlined the Committee\u2019s mandate, the conduct of the Regional Assessment, and the contents of the report the Committee had to provide the Minister upon completing the assessment: Agreement, clauses 4.14 and 4.15, and Appendices A and D, Appeal Book, at 126, 131\u2013132, 135\u2013137.\n[19] As the Agreement stipulated, the Committee was supported by a \u201cTask Team\u201d, comprised of technical staff, which came from the Agency, the C-NLOPB, and government departments: Agreement, clauses 4.1\u20134.8, Appeal Book, at 125\u2013126; Affidavit of Stephen B. Chapman, Appeal Book, at 1481, at para. 34. The Committee was also supported and advised by a technical advisory group (TAG). The TAG\u2019s members included the appellants, relevant government departments and agencies, Indigenous groups, and industry and stakeholder organisations, among others: Agreement, clauses 4.9\u20134.13, Appeal Book, at 126; Affidavit of Stephen B. Chapman, Appeal Book, 1481, at para. 34.\n(2) Assessment Phase [20] Indigenous groups were consulted in accordance with a formal three-phase consultation approach: Regional Assessment Report, section 2.2.4, Appeal Book, at 169\u2013172.\n[21] The Committee worked on the Regional Assessment from the spring of 2019 to May 2020, when it finalized the Geographic Information System tool (GIS). The GIS contains technical information in support of the Regional Assessment: FC Decision at para. 13.\n[22] During that period, the Committee held numerous meetings, including (1) a series of initial planning and issue-scoping meetings (May 2019); (2) TAG sessions on various themes, such as the development of the GIS (May 2019), Indigenous knowledge (September 2019), and literature reviews related to the potential environmental effects of offshore exploratory drilling (October 2019); and (3) workshops to discuss and seek input on the Committee\u2019s draft recommendations prior to the release of its draft report (December 2019).\n[23] The appellants actively participated in the Regional Assessment process. The intervener, le Conseil des Innu de Ekuanitshit (Conseil des Innu) participated in the activities involving Indigenous issues: FC Decision at paras. 4\u201313.\n[24] Except for certain documents, the Committee posted, on the Agency\u2019s online registry, the information it used to develop the Regional Assessment and the comments it received: Affidavit of Stephen B. Chapman, Appeal Book, at 1488, at paras. 67\u201368.\n[25] On January 23, 2020, the Committee released its draft report to the public\u2014including the appellants\u2014with a 30-day period to review and comment. The appellants and the Conseil des Innu provided their comments: FC Decision at para. 13; Affidavit of Gretchen Fitzgerald, Appeal Book, at 875\u2013876, at para. 23; Affidavit of Sigrid Kuehnemund, Appeal Book, at 1082, at para. 32; Affidavit of Keith Edward MacMaster, Appeal Book, at 1355\u20131357, at para. 37; Response to draft report from the Conseil des Innu dated February 21, 2020, Appeal Book, at 2437.\n[26] The Committee presented its final report (Report) to the Minister on February 29, 2020 and released the Report to the public on March 4, 2020: FC Decision at para. 13.\n(3) Decision-Making Phase\n[27] On the day the Report was published, the Agency released a Discussion Paper on a Ministerial Regulatory Proposal to Designate Offshore Exploratory Drilling East of Newfoundland and Labrador for Exclusion under the Impact Assessment Act (Discussion Paper on Regulatory Proposal): Affidavit of Stephen B. Chapman, Appeal Book, at 1500\u20131501, at para. 122; Discussion Paper on Regulatory Proposal, Appeal Book, at 1023\u20131049.\n[28] The public had until April 30, 2020 to provide comments on the proposed regulation: Affidavit of Stephen B. Chapman, Appeal Book, at 1501, at para. 125. The appellants and the Conseil des Innu provided such comments: Affidavit of Gretchen Fitzgerald, Appeal Book, at 892\u2013893, at paras. 63\u201364; Affidavit of Sigrid Kuehnemund, Appeal Book, at 1087\u20131088 at para. 44; Affidavit of Keith Edward MacMaster, Appeal Book, at 1360\u20131361, at para. 48; Comments on proposed regulation of the Conseil des Innu, Appeal Book, at 2460.\n[29] On June 3, 2020, the Minister made the Regulations Respecting Excluded Physical Activities (Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Exploratory Wells) (Excluded Activities Regs) pursuant to paragraph 112(1)(a.2) and section 112.1 of the Act. The Excluded Activities Regs came into force on June 4, 2020. These regulations exclude certain physical activities from the designated projects listed in section 34 of the schedule to the Activities Regs. Physical activities are only excluded if they satisfy the conditions in Schedule 2 of the Excluded Activities Regs. Excluded physical activities are therefore exempt from project-specific assessment.\n[30] On June 4, 2020, the Agency released two documents. First, the Agency released the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (Regulatory Analysis), which analyzes the impacts of the Excluded Activities Regs: Regulatory Analysis, Appeal Book, at 834\u2013865. Second, the Agency released the Minister\u2019s response to the Regional Assessment titled, Ministerial Response to the Regional Assessment Committee Report for Offshore Exploratory Drilling East of Newfoundland and Labrador (Ministerial Response). In this response, the Minister said the Regional Assessment \u201callowed the Government of Canada to collect information that enables a credible, evidence-based exclusion of offshore exploratory wells (in the Regional Assessment-defined Study Area) from undergoing project-specific federal impact assessment.\u201d The Minister added that \u201c[t]his may only occur when a proposed project conforms to the conditions set out in the [Excluded Activities Regs].\u201d The Minister generally accepted all the Committee\u2019s 41 recommendations. The Minister also largely agreed with the Committee\u2019s recommendations to incorporate certain measures into the Excluded Activities Regs as requirements for all future exploratory drilling in the Study Area. Thus, the Minister incorporated these measures into the Excluded Activities Regs, albeit with noted exceptions or additions, which he detailed in the Ministerial Response: Ministerial Response, Appeal Book, at 348\u2013370.\nC. Judicial Background (1) Appeal Prior to the IAA Reference [31] The appellants filed two applications for judicial review with the Federal Court: one challenging the Report\u2019s validity and another challenging the Excluded Activities Regs\u2019 validity. The Federal Court dismissed both applications. First, the Court held that the Report was not amenable to judicial review. Second, the Federal Court found the Excluded Activities Regs reasonable because (1) they were consistent with the Act\u2019s purpose, (2) they were within the regulation-making power in the Act, and (3) they met the condition precedent of subsection 112(2), since they were made after the Minister considered a Regional Assessment that was not materially deficient.\n[32] The appellants appeal the FC Decision. They say the Regional Assessment and the Excluded Activities Regs are the product of a reverse-engineered process because the decision to make these regulations was made before the assessment began. Working backwards, the Committee conducted an unreasonable assessment and denied the appellants procedural fairness. Moreover, the Minister did not address these deficiencies when making the Excluded Activities Regs via his own procedurally deficient process.\n[33] This Court heard the appeal on March 21, 2023.\n(2) The IAA Reference [34] In the IAA Reference, the Supreme Court was asked to determine the constitutional validity of the Act and the Activities Regs. The Court held that the entire Act, except sections 81\u201391, is ultra vires Parliament and therefore invalid; consequently, the Activities Regs are also invalid. The Court conducted a division of powers analysis to reach this conclusion. This analysis has two steps: characterization and classification.\n[35] First, at the characterization step, the Court considered the purpose and effects of the Act to identify its pith and substance. The Court concluded that the Act contains two distinct schemes: IAA Reference at para. 109. The first is a \u201cdesignated projects\u201d scheme, which assesses and regulates designated projects to mitigate or prevent their potential adverse environmental, health, social, and economic impacts. The second scheme, in sections 81\u201391, directs how federal authorities assess the significant adverse environmental effects of projects that they carry out or finance on federal lands or outside Canada.\n[36] Second, at the classification step, the Court considered which head of power the Act\u2019s pith and substance relates to. The second scheme (sections 81\u201391) was upheld for three reasons: (1) its constitutionality was unchallenged, (2) it resembles the legislation the Supreme Court upheld in Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transport), [1992] 1 SCR 3 [Oldman River], and (3) it is severable from the rest of the Act: IAA Reference at paras. 207\u2013211. However, the Supreme Court determined that the designated projects scheme, which comprises the balance of the Act, is unconstitutional. Two reasons prohibited the designated projects scheme from being classified under a federal head of power: IAA Reference at paras. 131\u2013139. Firstly, truly federal effects do not drive the scheme\u2019s decision-making functions: IAA Reference at paras. 141\u2013178. That is, decision makers could blend their assessment of adverse federal effects with other adverse effects that are not federal. Secondly, decision-making is driven by considerations labeled \u201ceffects within federal jurisdiction\u201d. Despite this label, these considerations far exceed federal jurisdiction: IAA Reference at paras. 179\u2013203. For these reasons, the Supreme Court ruled that the Act\u2014with the exception of sections 81 to 91\u2014and the Activities Regs exceeded Parliament\u2019s jurisdiction.\n(3) Position of the parties following the IAA Reference [37] Following the issuance of the IAA Reference, this Court directed the parties to provide written representations on the consequences, if any, of the IAA Reference to the present appeal.\n(a) Appellants\u2019 and Conseil des Innu \u2019s Position\n[38] The appellants and the Conseil des Innu argue that the IAA Reference does not affect the issues in this appeal. In their view, the IAA Reference addressed different provisions of the Act and dealt with situations involving areas where both provincial and federal governments had jurisdiction. By contrast, the present appeal deals with \u201cfederal lands\u201d, which fall within federal jurisdiction. Alternatively, the appellants argue that, if this Court determines that the IAA Reference invalidates the provisions dealing with regional assessments (sections 92\u2013103, 112\u2013112.1), then the Excluded Activities Regs lack a valid enabling provision and must be quashed. They add that, even if quashing these regulations renders the issues moot, the Court should nonetheless exercise its discretion to address the administrative law issues in the appeal.\n[39] Separately, the appellants filed a notice of constitutional question pursuant to section 57 of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-7. In their notice, the appellants questioned the constitutional validity of the Excluded Activities Regs. The Attorney General of Ontario (Ontario) and the Attorney General of Newfoundland Labrador (Newfoundland) intervened and filed written submissions in response to the notice of constitutional question.\n(b) Respondents\u2019 and Attorney General of Ontario\u2019s Position [40] In the respondents\u2019 view, the IAA Reference implicitly supports the conclusion that the Regional Assessment is not amenable to judicial review. Thus, only one issue remains: the validity of the Excluded Activities Regs. However, given the Supreme Court\u2019s determination that the designated projects scheme of the Act is unconstitutional, the Excluded Activities Regs can no longer have the intended effect of excluding activities from the designated projects scheme. As a result, there is no need to rule on the constitutionality of the Excluded Activities Regs and the issue of their validity is moot.\n[41] Ontario goes a step further than the respondents. Ontario says this Court must declare invalid the Act\u2019s impugned portions, the Activities Regs, and the Excluded Activities Regs. The Excluded Activities Regs must be declared invalid because they were made under paragraph 112(1)(a.2) and section 112.1, which are part of the scheme that the IAA Reference found unconstitutional. According to Ontario, since the Supreme Court opted not to grant a suspended declaration of invalidity of the Act and the Activities Regs, our Court\u2019s declaration of invalidity must have immediate effect.\n(c) Newfoundland and Labrador\u2019s Position [42] Newfoundland takes the position that the Excluded Activities Regs are intra vires Parliament. First, these regulations apply to the continental shelf, an area over which the federal government holds exclusive jurisdiction: Reference re Newfoundland Continental Shelf, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 86 at 97. Second, these regulations are the result of a collaborative effort between the governments of Newfoundland and Labrador and Canada, and their respective agencies. In other words, the Excluded Activities Regs are a product of cooperative federalism, a goal endorsed by the Supreme Court in the IAA Reference. It follows that applying the analysis and reasoning of the IAA Reference to this particular factual matrix leads to a finding of constitutionality of the Excluded Activities Regs. In the alternative, Newfoundland argues that this appeal calls for a suspended declaration of invalidity.\nIII. Issues [43] The appellants raise four issues:\nIs the Regional Assessment amenable to judicial review?\nWas the Regional Assessment unreasonable?\nWas the Regional Assessment procedurally unfair?\nWas the Minister\u2019s decision to make the Excluded Activities Regs unreasonable?\nIV. Analysis A. Regional Assessment\u2019s Amenability to Judicial Review [44] The Regional Assessment culminated in the Report, which the appellants challenge. The Federal Court concluded that the Report was not amenable to judicial review: FC Decision at para. 32. Before this Court, the parties agree that the question of amenability to judicial review is to be reviewed under the correctness standard. For the following reasons, I am of the view that the Regional Assessment and the Report are not amenable to judicial review.\n[45] As described above, the regional assessment mechanism essentially comprises three phases: planning, regional assessment, and decision-making.\n[46] The Act does not define the phrase \u201cregional assessment\u201d. The Agreement does. It defines the Regional Assessment as a \u201cstudy\u201d or \u201cassessment\u201d of the effects of existing or future physical activities carried out in a region. This definition makes clear that the Regional Assessment and its resulting Report are not decisions because they do not affect \u201clegal rights, impose legal obligations, or cause prejudicial effects\u201d: Sganos v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 84 at para. 6.\n[47] Rather, rights are affected or obligations are imposed when the Minister decides whether to make a regulation that excludes potential projects from project-specific assessments. The Act requires the Minister to consider the Regional Assessment before making such regulation, but the decision to act on the Regional Assessment is made by the Minister, not the Committee: subsection 112(2).\n[48] The three-phase regional mechanism mirrors the Act\u2019s designated projects scheme, described above. The designated projects scheme involves an assessment phase, during which the Agency or a review panel gathers information to develop a report. The designated projects scheme also involves a decision-making phase during which the Minister or the Governor considers the report and determines whether the project\u2019s effects are in the public interest. If the project\u2019s effects are in the public interest, the Minister imposes conditions for the designated project to be carried on. The Supreme Court held that the designated projects scheme \u201cestablishes an information-gathering process in the service of an ultimate decision-making function\u201d: IAA Reference at para. 81. Moreover, the Supreme Court emphasized that the assessment phase is clearly distinct from the decision-making phase, and that the two phases have different constitutional implications: IAA Reference at paras. 155\u2013161.\n[49] Applying the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis to the regional assessment mechanism, I find that the Regional Assessment (the assessment phase), while being an \u201cintegral component of sound decision-making\u201d (Oldman River at 71), does not involve decision-making and carries no legal consequences.\n[50] Thus, as determined by the Federal Court, this situation is no different from the ones previously reviewed by this Court and calls for the same conclusion: the Regional Assessment and the Report are not amenable to judicial review: FC Decision at paras. 29\u201330; Gitxaala Nation v. Canada, 2016 FCA 187 at para. 125 [Gitxaala]; Tsleil-Waututh Nation v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 153 at para. 202 [Trans Mountain]; Taseko Mines Ltd. v. Canada (Environment), 2019 FCA 319 at para. 43 [Taseko #1]; Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, 2023 FCA 191 at para. 107 [Mikisew].\n[51] Before this Court, the appellants present three arguments in support of a contrary conclusion.\n(1) The Right to Participate Meaningfully Argument [52] The appellants allege that the public\u2019s legal right to participate meaningfully in a regional assessment (paragraph 6(1)(h) and section 99) imposes a corresponding legal obligation on the Committee. If the right to participate meaningfully is denied, and the regional assessment is not subject to judicial review, then the wronged person or entity will have no remedy, a result contrary to the Act: Appellants\u2019 Memorandum of Fact and Law at para. 110.\n[53] I disagree.\n[54] The record shows that the appellants participated in the process and had numerous opportunities to make submissions at in person meetings and in written form. While they may be dissatisfied with the regional assessment, they have not demonstrated that they were denied meaningful participation.\n(2) The Purposes of the Act Argument [55] The appellants argue that requiring affected parties to wait for a decision to challenge the regional assessment\u2019s deficiencies would undermine the purposes of the Act, stated in paragraph 6(1)(b.1)\u2014namely, fairness, efficiency, and the predictability of impact assessments: Appellants\u2019 Memorandum of Fact and Law at para. 115.\n[56] Again, I disagree.\n[57] Allowing a party to challenge a regional assessment that may not result in any decision would be a waste a judicial resources and therefore inefficient. In addition, I fail to understand how challenging a regional assessment\u2014a study which may not result in further action\u2014would render the process fair or predictable.\n(3) The Legislative Changes Argument [58] Lastly, the appellants make an argument based on legislative changes. As I understand it, their argument is that the report issued under the Act\u2019s predecessor, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012, S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 52 (CEAA), was \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d and insulated from judicial review. As such, a report made under the CEAA is different from a report made under the Act; the latter is not insulated from judicial review. The appellants say that the Federal Court\u2019s failure to consider these differences led it to improperly rely on the decisions Gitxaala, Trans Mountain, and Taseko #1, which were rendered under the CEAA: Appellants\u2019 Memorandum of Fact and Law at paras. 115\u2013119.\n[59] I must disagree. If a report issued under the CEAA was, as the appellants say, more akin to a \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d decision, but was still found not to be amenable to judicial review, then it cannot be that a report made under the Act that is less akin to a \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d decision could be amenable to judicial review.\n(4) Conclusion on Amenability to Judicial Review [60] The Report is not amenable to judicial review. The same is true for the Regional Assessment, an interim document that simply culminates in the Report. Accordingly, the Federal Court correctly dismissed the appellants\u2019 application for judicial review of the Report.\n[61] That said, just because a regional assessment, standing alone, is not amenable to judicial review, does not mean it is always immune from judicial review. If a regional assessment is materially deficient (unreasonable or procedurally unfair), the resulting regulation may be quashed on the basis that the Minister lacked the legal prerequisite set out in subsection 112(2) to make that regulation: FC Decision at paras. 26, 31, citing Trans Mountain at para. 201; Mikisew at paras. 108\u2013109.\n[62] This case raises three remaining issues: the Regional Assessment\u2019s reasonableness, the Regional Assessment\u2019s procedural fairness, and the reasonableness of the Minister\u2019s decision to make the Excluded Activities Regs. However, deciding these issues would serve no useful purpose if the IAA Reference entails that the Minister lacked the authorization to make those regulations. Consequently, I must consider whether the IAA Reference renders these remaining issues moot.\nB. IAA Reference\u2019s Effect on the Remaining Issues\u2019 Mootness (1) The Doctrine of Mootness [63] Under the doctrine of mootness, courts may decline to hear a case when its decision will have no practical effects on the rights of the parties. Courts may nevertheless elect to hear a moot case if the circumstances warrant: Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342 at 353 [Borowski]. Thus, the doctrine of mootness involves two steps.\n[64] In the first step, a court decides whether the case is moot. A case is moot when no live controversy affects the rights of the parties: Borowski at 353\u2013356; Peckford v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 219 at para. 9 [Peckford].\n[65] In the second step of the mootness analysis, the court decides whether to exercise its discretion to hear the case despite mootness. In Borowski, the Supreme Court formulated three factors to guide courts\u2019 exercise of discretion:\nThe presence of an adversarial context;\nThe concern for judicial economy; and\nThe need for the court to be sensitive to its role as the adjudicative branch in our political framework.\n(Borowski at 358\u2013363; Peckford at para. 10)\n(2) Applying the Doctrine of Mootness to this Appeal [66] As mentioned, the appellants raise three remaining issues: the Regional Assessment\u2019s reasonableness, the Regional Assessment\u2019s procedural fairness, and the reasonableness of the Minister\u2019s decision to make the Excluded Activities Regs. Having reviewed the parties\u2019 and interveners\u2019 helpful submissions with regard to the IAA Reference, I conclude that these issues are moot because the Supreme Court determined that the Act is ultra vires Parliament, except a few provisions that do not apply in our case.\n[67] In principle, the Supreme Court\u2019s answer to a reference is advisory and non-binding; in practice, courts follow these rulings and treat them as judicial decisions: Reference re Code of Civil Procedure (Que.), art. 35, 2021 SCC 27 at paras. 151\u2013152; Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72 at para. 40; Reference Re Certification in the Manitoba Health Sector, 2019 MBCA 18. These authorities suggest that I must follow the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion that the entire Act is unconstitutional except sections 81\u201391. Although the IAA Reference did not specifically address the Act\u2019s regional assessment regime, this regime remains invalid because one cannot sever it from the designated projects scheme: IAA Reference at para. 210.\n[68] Moreover, the Supreme Court has stated that a tribunal must refuse to give effect to unconstitutional legislation: Ontario (Attorney General) v. G, 2020 SCC 38 at para. 88.\n[69] Since a valid regulation cannot be founded on an invalid statute, it stands to reason that the Excluded Activities Regs, like the Activities Regs, are invalid: Elmer A. Driedger, \u201cSubordinate Legislation\u201d (1960), 38 Can Bar Rev 1 at 7. In the context of this appeal, the IAA Reference\u2019s that the Act (except sections 81-91) is unconstitutional entails that the Minister lacked the authorization to make the Excluded Activities Regs: Tranchemontagne v. Ontario (Director, Disability Support Program), 2006 SCC 14 at para. 16; Brown v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FCA 130 at para. 40; Entertainment Software Association v. Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada, 2020 FCA 100 at para. 88; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Singh, 2016 FCA 300 at para. 16.\n[70] In addition, paragraph 112(1)(a.2) of the Act enables the Minister to make regulations to exclude physical activities that underwent a regional assessment from those designated as \u201cdesignated projects\u201d in the Activities Regs. Since the Supreme Court determined that the Activities Regs are unconstitutional, there is nothing from which to exclude physical activities anymore even if the factual matrix involves an area over which the federal government holds exclusive jurisdiction. Consequently, the remaining issues are moot under the first step of the Borowski analysis.\n[71] The next step of the mootness analysis is to determine whether this Court should exercise its discretion to address the remaining issues despite their mootness. The appellants and the respondents acknowledge that there remains an adversarial context between them. While this acknowledgment supports a decision to address the three remaining issues, the following two considerations weigh heavily against it.\n(a) Judicial Economy [72] This appeal was not the beginning of the dispute between the appellants, the Committee, and the Minister. This dispute started some five years ago, when the Regional Assessment was being conducted. The factual background, the evidence, and the parties\u2019 submissions show that the parties invested tremendous effort and expense in the Regional Assessment and the Excluded Activities Regs.\n[73] I cannot overstate the magnitude of the work that the parties and the interveners have put into this appeal and the preceding judicial review application. The judicial expenditures were incurred, and all that remains is for this Court to rule on the three remaining issues. Against this background, the appellants argue that, should this Court refuse to rule on the three remaining issues, they will be forced to pursue a third hearing in the Federal Court if the Minister relies on the Report to re-enact the Excluded Activities Regs in the future.\n[74] The problem is that this Court ruling on the three remaining issues would not necessarily eliminate a third hearing or another legal challenge. The Regional Assessment\u2014which culminated in the Report\u2014was relevant to this appeal because subsection 112(2) of the Act provides that the Minister must consider a regional assessment before making a regulation. It was therefore necessary to ensure that the report was not materially deficient, thus engendering the second and third issues raised by the appellants. It is uncertain whether Parliament will retain, in a modified version of the Act, the obligation to consider a regional assessment before making a regulation. This obligation may be accompanied by the need to consider other elements. In this uncertain context, what good would a ruling on the three remaining issues do? How would ruling on the Regional Assessment\u2019s reasonableness or procedural fairness avoid further litigation if the consideration of a regional assessment is no longer a prerequisite of the Act or if it is only one of various prerequisites?\n[75] The question about the usefulness of a ruling on the remaining issues remains relevant even if Parliament were to maintain, in a modified version of the Act, the requirement for the Minister to consider a regional assessment prior to making regulations. This is so because nothing guarantees the Minister would consider the Regional Assessment he considered prior to making the Excluded Activities Regs. Were the Minister to consider the Regional Assessment in making future regulations, perhaps a ruling from this Court that the Regional Assessment is reasonable and procedurally fair would be of no avail to the appellants. For instance, the passage of time or contextual changes might support arguments against the reasonableness or procedural fairness of the Regional Assessment that were not made in this appeal, thereby justifying another judicial challenge. Equally, a ruling that the Regional Assessment is unreasonable and was procedurally unfair may be of no assistance to the appellants if the Minister considers an improved version of the Regional Assessment before making future regulations.\n[76] It follows that ruling on the three remaining issues may not prevent future litigation. In addition, such a ruling would have no practical effect on the rights of the parties and serve no purpose. Ruling on the reasonableness of the Minister\u2019s decision to make these regulations would serve no useful purpose. Similarly, ruling on the Regional Assessment\u2019s reasonableness and procedural fairness would be of limited value because such a ruling would be rendered in a specific context unlikely to be replicated in the future: Peckford at para. 31.\n(b) Role of this Court [77] Given the Supreme Court\u2019s determination in the IAA Reference, it is better left to Parliament to decide what should happen next.\nV. Conclusion [78] In light of the above, I would dismiss the appeal. The Federal Court correctly dismissed the appellants\u2019 application for judicial review of the Report, and the remaining three issues are moot.\n\"Nathalie Goyette\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nRichard Boivin J.A.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\nSylvie E.

It also seeks an interlocutory injunction prohibiting certain public statements relating to the issues in dispute.\n[2] The present appeal is one of two that take issue with a single decision of the Federal Court (2024 FC 413, per Justice Paul Favel) that addressed two applications for judicial review.\n[3] One of the applications was commenced by SRFN (Federal Court No. T-2191-22) and took issue with a decision by the respondent, Cecilia (Toni) Josephine Heron, acting as Chief of SRFN, on October 18, 2022 to call a Special Meeting to remove two SRFN Councillors from office. That Special Meeting was held on October 23, 2022, and it resulted in the removal of the two Councillors in question. The Federal Court dismissed SRFN\u2019s application, and that dismissal is the subject of this Court\u2019s File No. A-109-24.\n[4] The other application addressed by the Federal Court\u2019s decision (Federal Court File No. T-2206-22) was a consolidation of a pair of applications commenced by Ms. Heron (the other one being Federal Court File No. T-97-23), which took issue with a series of decisions by SRFN (beginning on October 13, 2022, and continuing on December 12, 2022 and thereafter) that repeatedly suspended Ms. Heron from her position as Chief without pay. The Federal Court granted that application, and ordered that Ms. Heron be paid the salary she had lost because of the suspensions. This aspect of the Federal Court\u2019s decision is the subject of the present appeal, File No. A-107-24.\n[5] The parties agree that (i) paragraph 50(1)(b) of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, provides the authority for this Court to grant a stay where \u201cit is in the interest of justice that the proceedings be stayed\u201d, and (ii) Rule 398(1)(b) of the Federal Courts Rules, S.O.R.\/98-106, provides that \u201c[o]n the motion of a person against whom an order has been made, \u2026 (b) where a notice of appeal of the order has been issued, a judge of the court that is to hear the appeal may order that it be stayed.\u201d\n[6] The parties also agree that the legal test applicable to SRFN\u2019s motion (with regard to both the stay and the injunction it seeks) is as contemplated in RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311, 111 D.L.R. (4th) 385 (RJR-MacDonald). The moving party must establish (i) a serious question to be tried, (ii) that it will suffer irreparable harm if the stay (or the injunction) is not granted, and (iii) that the balance of convenience favours granting the stay.\n[7] The threshold for establishing a serious question to be tried is generally a low one. The Court must be satisfied that the appeal is not frivolous or vexatious: RJR-MacDonald at 348.\n[8] With regard to irreparable harm, the moving party must adduce clear, compelling and non-speculative evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that it will suffer \u201charm which either cannot be quantified in monetary terms or which cannot be cured\u201d: RJR-MacDonald at 341; Sheldon M. Chumir Foundation for Ethics in Leadership v. Canada (National Revenue), 2023 FCA 242 at paras. 6\u20138.\n[9] The issue of the balance of convenience involves \u201ca determination of which of the two parties will suffer the greater harm from the granting or refusal of an interlocutory injunction, pending a decision on the merits\u201d: RJR-MacDonald at 342.\n[10] Having considered SRFN\u2019s submissions, as well as Ms. Heron\u2019s responding submissions and SRFN\u2019s reply submissions, I have concluded that SRFN\u2019s motion should be dismissed.\n[11] It is not necessary for me to reach a conclusion as to (i) whether SRFN has established a serious question to be tried in the present appeal, or (ii) the balance of convenience, because I have concluded that it has not established that it will suffer irreparable harm if the stay (or the injunction) is not granted.\n[12] SRFN makes arguments of irreparable harm in relation to the following:\nSRFN\u2019s reputation;\nCritical funding for SRFN;\nSRFN\u2019s membership; and\nMs. Heron\u2019s impecuniosity.\n[13] I will address each of these in turn.\n[14] Regarding its reputation, SRFN refers to \u201cfractious and confusing political upheavals at SRFN in 2009-2011 [during which] SRFN suffered irreparable harm to its reputation and ability to conduct its day-to-day business.\u201d SRFN argues that \u201cstaff were unable to work or left because of the political tensions and uncertainty; and, that the same thing is happening to SRFN again.\u201d SRFN also argues that it took SRFN years to recover its reputation.\n[15] Firstly, bearing in mind that evidence of irreparable harm must be clear, compelling and non-speculative, I am not convinced that there is admissible (non-hearsay) and compelling evidence to support the assertion that the harmful effects of the previous political upheaval at SRFN are happening again. Though the ingredients may be present, and such effects might occur, I find the assertion to be speculative and not compelling. I also note that the SRFN even acknowledges that its reputation recovered in time. Accordingly, it is not clear to me that any harm of the kind asserted by SRFN would be irreparable.\n[16] Further, I am not convinced that either the stay or the interlocutory injunction that SRFN seeks would be effective in avoiding the alleged harm to SRFN\u2019s reputation. My sense is that the political turmoil threatening SRFN\u2019s reputation would remain even if the motion were granted.\n[17] I turn now to SRFN\u2019s argument that critical funding will be jeopardized if the motion is not granted. In my view, this argument is speculative and therefore insufficient. SRFN refers to disruption and instability that could jeopardize SRFN\u2019s chances of being awarded significant funds to continue a housing project. SRFN also argues that it will suffer irreparable harm if negotiations are disrupted or delayed. Based on these contingencies, I am not convinced on a balance of probabilities that SRFN will suffer irreparable harm.\n[18] SRFN\u2019s third irreparable harm argument, concerning its membership, is not a distinct argument. Rather, it alludes to the irreparable effects of the foregoing alleged harms on members of SRFN if the status quo prior to the Federal Court\u2019s decision is not restored. I am not convinced that any of the foregoing alleged irreparable harm will result from the dismissal of SRFN\u2019s motion. Likewise, I am not convinced that it will cause irreparable harm to its membership.\n[19] With regard to Ms. Heron\u2019s impecuniosity, I note that the evidence cited by SRFN is merely a bald assertion that, if her unpaid salary is paid to her and then the present appeal is successful, SRFN will never recover it. There is no evidence of Ms. Heron\u2019s financial status or her ability to return any monies paid to her. As indicated, the burden is on SRFN to adduce clear, compelling and non-speculative evidence to support its assertions. SRFN has not met that burden as regards assertions of Ms. Heron\u2019s impecuniosity.\n[20] SRFN also makes submissions expressing concern for the safety of SRFN administrative staff. However, the evidence cited by SRFN in support of these concerns is entirely hearsay, and does not appear to fall within any of the exceptions to the inadmissibility of hearsay evidence. I give this evidence no weight.\n[21] It follows from the foregoing reasons that I am not convinced that SRFN will suffer any irreparable harm if the requested stay and interlocutory injunction are not granted, and therefore the motion should be dismissed. The costs of this motion will be in the cause.\n\"George R.

The two are identical, there being no confidential information disclosed in the confidential reasons.\nLOCKE J.A.\nI. Background [1] This is an appeal of a decision of the Federal Court (2022 FC 107, per Justice Michael D. Manson) in the context of an action brought pursuant to subsection 6(1) of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations, S.O.R.\/93-133. In that action, the respondents, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. (collectively, Janssen), sought a declaration that the appellant, Apotex Inc. (Apotex), would infringe Canadian Patent No. 2,655,335 (the 335 Patent) if it were to make, use or sell its generic version of Janssen\u2019s patented medicine called INVEGA SUSTENNA.\n[2] INVEGA SUSTENNA involves a suspension of paliperidone palmitate for the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders. The 335 Patent teaches a regimen to achieve an optimum plasma concentration-time profile. It teaches a first loading dose administered in the deltoid muscle on day 1, a second loading dose administered in the deltoid muscle on day 8, and then monthly maintenance doses thereafter administered either in the deltoid or gluteal muscle. For non-renally impaired patients, the first and second loading doses are 150 and 100 mg equivalent (mg-eq.), respectively, and the monthly maintenance doses are 75 mg-eq. each. For renally impaired patients, the first and second loading doses are 100 and 75 mg-eq., respectively, and the monthly maintenance doses are 50 mg-eq. each.\n[3] Apotex brought a motion for summary trial seeking dismissal of Janssen\u2019s action on the basis that its product would not infringe the 335 Patent since it would not provide the 75 mg-eq. dose, which is an essential element of all of the claims thereof. The Federal Court found that it was an appropriate proceeding for summary trial, but decided the action in favour of Janssen, finding that Apotex would induce infringement of the 335 Patent with its generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA.\n[4] The legal test for a finding of inducing patent infringement was correctly stated by the Federal Court at paragraph 113 of its reasons:\nThere is a three \u201cprong\u201d test for inducement: (1) direct infringement by a third party; (2) the inducer influenced the third party to the point that the infringing act would not have occurred without the influence; and (3) the defendant knew that its influence would bring about the infringing act [Corlac Inc. v. Weatherford Canada Ltd., 2011 FCA 228 [Corlac]].\n[5] The Federal Court found that each of the prongs of the test was satisfied. In the present appeal, Apotex takes issue only with the second prong. Specifically, Apotex argues that the Federal Court erred in finding that it would induce infringement of the 335 Patent such that, without its influence, the act of direct infringement would not occur.\n[6] For the reasons set out below, I would dismiss this appeal.\nII. The Federal Court\u2019s Decision [7] The Federal Court addressed the second prong of the test for inducing infringement at paragraphs 125 to 148 of its reasons.\n[8] After correctly defining the legal test, the Federal Court noted Apotex\u2019s argument that the facts were similar to those in Janssen Inc. v. Teva Canada Limited, 2020 FC 593, 321 A.C.W.S. (3d) 539 (Teva Paliperidone), and that the Court should therefore follow its conclusion therein that \u201cany act of direct infringement would be a result of physician skill and judgment applied to specific patient characteristics, rather than any influence exercised by the product monograph for the [Apotex] Product\u201d (paragraph 129 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons). Unfortunately for Apotex, the argument that the result in this case on inducing infringement should follow that in Teva Paliperidone no longer assists it because the Federal Court\u2019s conclusion on that issue was reversed on appeal to this Court: Teva Canada Limited v. Janssen Inc., 2023 FCA 68, [2023] F.C.J. No. 467.\n[9] The Federal Court went on to address a further argument by Apotex. This is based on the assertions that:\n\u201c[T]he ultimate dosing decision is based on physician skill and judgment, not the language in the product monograph\u201d; and\nBecause physicians are already familiar with the INVEGA SUSTENNA product, they will not be influenced in their prescribing practices to the extent necessary to meet the second prong of the test in Corlac (see paragraph 132 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons).\n[10] The Federal Court found that each of the expert witnesses agreed that \u201cpatients may receive the claimed dosage regimen as a result of referring to the Apotex product monograph\u201d (see paragraph 138 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons). The Federal Court also found that \u201cApotex\u2019s product monograph includes recommendations to prescribers for use of the claimed dosage regimen\u201d (see paragraph 143 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons).\n[11] The Federal Court concluded its discussion of the second prong of the test for inducing infringement as follows:\n[147] Notwithstanding the exercise of skill and judgment by prescribing physicians in selecting the dosing regimen for patients, the evidence before the Court in this case establishes that acts of infringement will be influenced by the acts of the alleged inducer, Apotex, to the point that, without the influence, direct infringement will not take place. Apotex\u2019s product monograph will influence prescribers and patients to implement the claimed dosage regimen, thereby directly infringing the 335 Patent.\n[148] I am satisfied, on the evidence before the Court that Janssen has proven, on a balance of probabilities, that at least some prescribers of the impugned [Apotex] Product will be sufficiently influenced by the Apotex product monograph to induce infringement by those prescribing physicians.\nIII. Standard of Review [12] The parties agree that the standard of review applicable in this case is as set out in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. Questions of law are reviewed on a standard of correctness, and questions of fact or of mixed fact and law from which no question of law is extricable are reviewed on a standard of palpable and overriding error. A palpable error is one that is obvious. An overriding error is one that goes to the very core of the outcome of the case. When arguing palpable and overriding error, it is not enough to pull at leaves and branches and leave the tree standing. The entire tree must fall: Canada v. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 FCA 165, [2012] F.C.J. No. 669 at para. 46 (cited with approval in Benhaim v. St-Germain, 2016 SCC 48, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 352 at para. 38).\nIV. Analysis [13] Apotex focuses its argument on the high threshold for influence required by the second prong of the test for inducement: that the infringing act would not have occurred without the influence. This Court has equated this threshold to a sine qua non (without which not) test: MacLennan v. Produits Gilbert Inc., 2008 FCA 35, [2008] F.C.J. No. 128 at para. 38 (MacLennan). Apotex urges this Court to treat the threshold as a \u201cbut for\u201d test, and it cites jurisprudence that calls this a causation test. I have no objection to Apotex\u2019s characterization of the test, but I do not find it to be more helpful that the \u201cwould not have occurred without\u201d and \u201csine qua non\u201d characterizations provided in the jurisprudence of this Court. In my view, these are merely different ways of describing the same threshold.\n[14] Apotex relies on the fact that its product monograph would essentially be a copy of that for INVEGA SUSTENNA, and the assertion that prescribing practices of physicians would not change if Apotex were allowed to market its generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA. In light of the foregoing, Apotex argues that any influence that its product monograph could have on any ultimate act of direct infringement could not rise to the level required in Corlac.\n[15] Apotex supplements its argument by asserting that the Federal Court lacked any meaningful analysis in its consideration of the second prong. It adds that the Federal Court\u2019s statement at paragraph 138 of its reasons that \u201cpatients may receive the claimed dosage regimen as a result of referring to the Apotex product monograph\u201d (see paragraph 10 above) can be of limited assistance because paragraph 138 contains inaccuracies and appears to have been copied from another decision.\n[16] I will address this supplementary argument first. It is helpful to begin by quoting the entirety of paragraph 138 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons:\nAs outlined previously, each expert agrees that patients may receive the claimed dosage regimen as a result of referring to the Apotex product monograph. All four experts acknowledged on cross-examination that while the product monograph for the [Apotex] Product does not explicitly recommend a 75 mg-eq. monthly maintenance dose, it is a therapeutic option within a recommended range in the Apotex product monograph. Moreover, a 75 mg-eq. loading dose on Day 8 is explicitly recommended for renally impaired patients.\n[17] Apotex argues that it was simply wrong to state that the content of the first sentence in that paragraph was \u201coutlined previously\u201d. It adds that paragraph 138 is essentially the same as paragraph 131 from Janssen Inc. v. Pharmascience Inc., 2022 FC 62, 190 C.P.R. (4th) 1 (Pharmascience), which the same judge (Justice Manson) decided just days prior in another case involving the same Janssen plaintiffs, the same 335 Patent, and the same drug (INVEGA SUSTENNA). Apotex argues that there is a similar problem in relation to the remainder of paragraph 138 \u2013 it is essentially the same as paragraph 127 of Pharmascience. Apotex asserts that the summary trial that led to the present appeal heard from five experts not four, and that those experts agreed that Apotex\u2019s product monograph does explicitly recommend a 75 mg-eq. maintenance dose.\n[18] I agree with Apotex that it appears that parts of paragraph 138 of the Federal Court\u2019s reasons in the decision under appeal were lifted from Pharmascience. It also appears that this paragraph contains some factual inaccuracies. That said, I am not convinced that these inaccuracies rise to the level of overriding errors of such a nature that this Court should intervene.\n[19] Firstly, it was entirely reasonable for the Federal Court to state that the content of the first sentence of paragraph 138 was \u201coutlined previously\u201d. The Federal Court elaborated on this point in paragraphs 139 and 140 of its reasons. In my view, the following paragraphs from the Federal Court\u2019s reasons addressed the experts\u2019 testimony as it related to the issue that \u201cpatients may receive the claimed dosage regimen as a result of referring to the Apotex product monograph\u201d: for Dr. Oluboka, paragraph 63, for Dr. Zhang, paragraph 71, for Dr. Agid, paragraphs 84 and 85, for Dr. Chue, paragraphs 94 and 95, and for Mr. Jones, paragraph 102.\n[20] Further, reading the Federal Court\u2019s reasons as a whole, I do not agree that it was actually confused as to the number of experts or that it misunderstood the nature of their testimonies. The Federal Court provided a summary of each expert\u2019s testimony at paragraphs 58 to 74 and 80 to 104 of its reasons. The reference in paragraph 138 to \u201c[a]ll four experts\u201d appears to be no more than a slip of the pen.\n[21] I also disagree with Apotex\u2019s argument that the Federal Court lacked any meaningful analysis in its consideration of the second prong. Paragraph 124 of its reasons, reproduced here, provides some analysis:\nThere appears to be several instances in the [Apotex] Product product monograph that will influence a physician to prescribe a 75 mg-eq. maintenance dose as part of the claimed dosing regimen leading to direct infringement of the 335 Patent: (i) in the recommended maintenance dose ranges in which 75 mg-eq. is one of the doses; and (ii) in tables outlining instructions for switching patients from oral paliperidone to an injectable product, like the [Apotex] Product or INVEGA SUSTENNA\u00ae. In addition, there is no dispute that 75 mg-eq. is the second loading dose for renally-impaired patients.\n[22] Moreover, the Federal Court\u2019s discussion of Janssen\u2019s arguments at paragraphs 137 and following of its reasons provide an indication of the arguments and evidence upon which it relied. I mention a couple of these at paragraph 10 above. For these reasons, I disagree that the Federal Court\u2019s analysis in its consideration of the second prong was insufficiently based on the facts and law.\n[23] I turn now to Apotex\u2019s more substantive argument that the Federal Court erred in concluding that the high threshold for the second prong of the test for inducing infringement was met in this case. The main weakness of this argument is that it depends on there being a requirement that prescribing practices of physicians be altered because of Apotex\u2019s activities. In fact, this is not necessary. What is required is that the ultimate act of direct infringement occur because of Apotex\u2019s activities.\n[24] It is important to bear in mind that the ultimate act of direct infringement in the present case could be either by a prescriber (e.g. a physician or a nurse practitioner) or by a patient: Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research, 2020 FCA 30, [2020] F.C.J. No. 179 at para. 40, citing AB Hassle v. Genpharm Inc., 2003 FC 1443, 243 F.T.R 6 at para. 127, aff\u2019d 2004 FCA 413, [2004] F.C.J. No. 2079. The Federal Court recognized this at paragraphs 74 and 104 of its reasons. It is also important to understand that inducing patent infringement can occur even where there is no direct contact between the inducer and the direct infringer: MacLennan at para. 43, citing Procter & Gamble Co. v. Bristol-Myers Canada Ltd., [1978] F.C.J. No. 812, 39 C.P.R. (2d) 145 at 167. Accordingly, Apotex could be found to induce infringement by a patient even if they have no direct communication.\n[25] It follows that, even if the practices of prescribing physicians were to remain unchanged following the introduction to the market of Apotex\u2019s generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA, the fact would remain that activities by patients (and by prescribers) that had previously been non-infringing (because the drug was sourced from Janssen) would be infringing once the drug was sourced from Apotex, an unlicensed supplier. As indicated at paragraph 11 above, the Federal Court concluded at paragraphs 147 and 148 of its reasons that such infringement would be influenced by Apotex to the point that, without the influence, direct infringement would not take place. It is in this sense that the Federal Court was entitled to conclude that the second prong of the test for inducing patent infringement was met.\n[26] Apotex argues that the mere fact that its product monograph would be available for consultation is not enough to meet the test for influence. Apotex also argues that the evidence before the Federal Court did not go beyond merely establishing that Apotex\u2019s product monograph would have some influence on the use of its generic version of INVEGA SUSTENNA, and therefore did not meet the high threshold for the second prong (the infringing act would not have occurred without the influence). Apotex notes that none of the experts went so far in their testimony as to state explicitly that any direct infringement using Apotex\u2019s product would not occur without Apotex\u2019s influence.\n[27] In my view, this is a factually suffused issue on which Apotex would have to establish that the Federal Court made a palpable and overriding error. The Federal Court did not err in law. Moreover, I am not convinced that, based on the evidence, the Federal Court could not have concluded that the threshold was met. It was entitled to draw inferences from the evidence before it, and there was evidence to support the conclusion that Apotex\u2019s product monograph would give rise to the required influence.\nV. Conclusion [28] It follows from the foregoing that I would dismiss the present appeal. I would award costs to Janssen in the agreed amount of $10,000, all-inclusive.\n\"George R.

Overview [1] These consolidated appeals concern two interlocutory decisions of a Designated Judge of the Federal Court issued in the context of proceedings under section 38 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5 (CEA). By an application brought pursuant to section 38.04, the Attorney General of Canada (AGC) is seeking to protect sensitive or potentially injurious information from disclosure in a proceeding commenced in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (OSCJ).\n[2] The underlying proceeding is an action commenced in January 2021 by the appellants, the Sakab Saudi Holding Company and other corporate plaintiffs (the Sakab Parties), against the respondent, Saad Khalid S Al Jabri (Al Jabri) and other related defendants. The Sakab Parties seek damages of now over $5 billion from Al Jabri and other defendants.\n[3] It is alleged in the pleadings before the OSCJ that the Sakab Parties are a group of corporations created to pursue commercial and counterterrorism activities for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Al Jabri is said to be a former high-ranking government official of the KSA who held the role of Special Advisor to the former Minister of the Interior. Al Jabri is also alleged to be a former Minister of State and member of the Council of Ministers. In 2015, he was relieved of his governmental duties, but continued to serve in an informal capacity until he relocated to Canada in 2017 (Appeal Book at 233, Second Fresh as Amended Statement of Claim, at paras. 32, 34-35, 43, 177; Appeal Book at 911, Statement of Defence, at paras. 13, 30).\n[4] The Sakab Parties claim that Al Jabri orchestrated and executed an international fraudulent scheme by leveraging his position in the government of the KSA to \u201cestablish corporations intended ostensibly to perform anti-terrorism activities for the service of the KSA and its public interest\u201d, to \u201censure funding of those corporations by the KSA\u2019s Ministry of the Interior\u201d and to misappropriate funds from the Sakab Parties to himself and others (Appeal Book at 233, Second Fresh as Amended Statement of Claim, at paras. 26-27).\n[5] Al Jabri denies having defrauded the Sakab Parties. He claims that the funds paid to him by the Sakab Parties were authorized by the former Minister of the Interior under his delegated authority from the King. They were meant to compensate Al Jabri for the performance of his official duties for the KSA government and the Minister of the Interior, and for his involvement in the security-related aspects of the activities undertaken by the Sakab Parties (Appeal Book at 911, Statement of Defence, at paras. 86, 172, 178; Appeal Book at 798, affidavit of Al Jabri in the OSCJ, at paras. 27, 47, 188).\n[6] Al Jabri contends that some of the information that he will rely on to defend the fraud action cannot be disclosed because it is sensitive or potentially injurious information as defined in section 38 of the CEA. The information he seeks to disclose is contained in a document referred to as a proffer, over which he asserts litigation privilege, and 17 supporting documents. The proffer is described as an unsworn \u201csolicitor\u2019s brief\u201d or lawyer\u2019s \u201cmemo to file\u201d, setting out in detail all the information that Al Jabri views as relevant to defending the action and as potentially engaging section 38 of the CEA (Appeal Book at 1833, Al Jabri\u2019s brief for September 27, 2022, case conference, at para. 3; Appeal Book at 2330, transcript of case conference held on September 27, 2022, at 2335-2340).\n[7] In 2022, following receipt of notices under section 38.01 of the CEA, the AGC brought an application in the Federal Court for an order confirming the non-disclosure of some of the information referred to in the notices and contained in the proffer and supporting documents. The Designated Judge named Al Jabri and the Sakab Parties as respondents in the application and appointed an amicus curiae to assist the Court in performing its statutory obligations under section 38 of the CEA.\n[8] In the course of the section 38 proceedings, Al Jabri asserted that the entire proffer was subject to litigation privilege and would remain so vis-\u00e0-vis the Sakab Parties. As a result, in October 2022, the Sakab Parties brought a motion challenging, among other things, whether the proffer could properly be the subject of a section 38 application. They also argued that they would be particularly prejudiced in making submissions about the relevance of the redacted information in the section 38 proceeding if they were precluded from receiving a copy of the proffer, once redacted by the AGC and filed with the Federal Court. The motion was heard on December 6 and 7, 2022 and dismissed on January 10, 2023 (2023 FC 40 \u2013 Sakab #1).\n[9] In her reasons, the Designated Judge acknowledged that the circumstances were unusual given that the proffer was not a document filed in the underlying proceeding, was not subject to a production order, and was cloaked in litigation privilege. However, she found that the \u201cform or packaging\u201d did not matter as the AGC was required to review the information regardless (Sakab #1 at para. 177). She accepted Al Jabri\u2019s explanation that the proffer had been drafted to provide all the information that was likely to be otherwise disclosed in the course of the fraud action, in order to avoid a series of notices and applications. She held that, while the Court did not encourage the creation of new documents for a section 38 application, it would be more efficient to deal with as much information as possible in one application to avoid multiple section 38 applications and further delay the underlying litigation (Sakab #1 at paras. 178-180).\n[10] Noting that the AGC had not completed its review of the proffer, she found that many of the Sakab Parties\u2019 allegations were based on speculation. She found that there had not yet been any abuse of process and rejected the Sakab Parties\u2019 allegation that the section 38 process would be unfair unless they were provided a copy of the redacted proffer (Sakab #1 at paras. 181-204). She observed that the determination of a section 38 application identifies the information that cannot be disclosed; it does not result in the Court ordering that certain information be disclosed or produced (Sakab #1 at para. 208).\n[11] While the first motion was still outstanding, the Sakab Parties brought a second motion seeking a declaration that the proffer was not subject to any form of privilege. They also sought an order directing the AGC and\/or Al Jabri to produce a copy of the proffer to the Sakab Parties once redacted by the AGC for any sensitive or potentially injurious information. This second motion was heard on August 17, 2023, and dismissed on October 6, 2023 (2023 FC 1338 \u2013 Sakab #2).\n[12] In denying the second motion, the Designated Judge found that the Sakab Parties were essentially seeking the same ultimate relief in both motions, namely the disclosure of the redacted proffer (Sakab #2 at para. 81). She then reaffirmed that the proffer could be the subject of a section 38 application (Sakab #2 at para. 92). She further found that the determination of whether the proffer is subject to litigation privilege was beyond the scope of her jurisdiction. In her view, any challenge of the assertion of litigation privilege should be pursued in the OSCJ (Sakab #2 at para. 98). Finally, she held that the Court could not order production of the proffer to the Sakab Parties, regardless of whether the Court had jurisdiction to determine litigation privilege and of whether the proffer was protected by litigation privilege (Sakab #2 at para. 99).\n[13] In the meantime, the AGC completed his review of the proffer and supporting documents and informed the Court that he was prohibiting the disclosure of some of the information in the documents in order to prevent injury to national security. He also advised that he would provide the redacted proffer to Al Jabri\u2019s counsel and file the redacted document with the Designated Registry of the Court so that the section 38 application could proceed to the next steps. Al Jabri disclosed the redacted supporting documents to the Sakab Parties but refused disclosure of the redacted proffer, asserting litigation privilege.\n[14] Before this Court, the Sakab Parties appeal both interlocutory orders of the Designated Judge. They submit that the overarching issue raised by these appeals is whether they are entitled to the production of a copy of the redacted proffer. They argue that the Designated Judge erred in concluding that a nominally privileged proffer, drafted by counsel, could be the subject of a section 38 application. They also claim that the Designated Judge erred in concluding that she had no jurisdiction to adjudicate a privilege claim or to order production of the redacted proffer under section 38 of the CEA. Finally, they contend that the redacted proffer is not subject to litigation privilege and that they are entitled to the production of the redacted proffer.\n[15] For the reasons set out below, I find that the Designated Judge did not err in concluding that the proffer could be the subject of an application under section 38 of the CEA. I also find it unnecessary to decide whether the Designated Judge erred in concluding that she did not have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the privilege claim or to order production of the proffer given her conclusions on the issues of fairness and abuse of process.\n[16] By order of this Court dated November 9, 2023, the two appeals were consolidated. A copy of these reasons shall be filed in both appeals.\nII. Analysis [17] The standards of review in appeals from discretionary interlocutory orders are those set out in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 (Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, 2016 FCA 215 at para. 79). The Court may intervene if the Designated Judge made an error of law, or a palpable and overriding error of fact or mixed fact and law, unless there is an extricable error of law in which case the standard of correctness applies.\nA. The Proffer and Section 38 Proceedings [18] The Sakab Parties submit that the Designated Judge erred in law in finding that the proffer could be the subject of proceedings under section 38 of the CEA. They argue that Al Jabri\u2019s \u201csubmission of the [p]roffer is contrary to the scheme of the [CEA], which governs information that a party intends to or may disclose in the underlying proceeding and which specifically exempts information provided to a party\u2019s solicitor\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Memorandum of Fact and Law at para. 74). They contend that subsection 38.01(6) of the CEA stipulates that the section 38 regime does not apply to information disclosed to a party\u2019s lawyer if relevant to a proceeding. A section 38 notice could not be provided, and an application could not be brought, in connection with a \u201csolicitor\u2019s brief\u201d asserted to be privileged. Put differently, they claim that the section 38 scheme \u201cdoes not apply to information provided only to a person\u2019s solicitor in preparation for litigation because the purpose of the regime is to regulate the disclosure of sensitive or potentially injurious information in a \u2018proceeding\u2019 \u2013 not a lawyer\u2019s office\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Memorandum of Fact and Law at para. 77).\n[19] In my view, the Sakab Parties\u2019 arguments are not consistent with the overall scheme and purpose of section 38 of the CEA, of which I will provide a brief overview.\n[20] Section 38 of the CEA sets out a mandatory statutory process governing the use and protection of sensitive or potentially injurious information in connection with, or in the course of a proceeding before a court, person, or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information. It defines \u201csensitive information\u201d as \u201cinformation relating to international relations or national defence or national security that is in the possession of the Government of Canada, whether originating from inside or outside Canada, and is of a type that the Government of Canada is taking measures to safeguard\u201d. It also defines \u201cpotentially injurious information\u201d as \u201cinformation of a type that, if it were disclosed to the public, could injure international relations or national defence or national security.\u201d\n[21] When, in connection with a proceeding, a participant is required to disclose, or expects to disclose or cause the disclosure of sensitive or potentially injurious information, they must give notice to the AGC in writing as soon as possible of the possibility of the disclosure, and of the nature, date and place of the proceeding (subsection 38.01(1)). The broad notice requirements extend to all participants to a proceeding (subsection 38.01(2)) and to non-participating officials (subsections 38.01(3)-(4)). The immediate effect of the notice is to prohibit disclosure of the sensitive or potentially injurious information, including the fact that notice was provided (section 38.02).\n[22] Upon review of the information, the AGC may authorize the disclosure of all or part of the information (section 38.03). Where the AGC does not authorize the disclosure of the information or enter into an agreement to permit disclosure of some of the facts or information subject to conditions (section 38.031), the AGC may bring an application to the Federal Court for an order confirming the prohibition on disclosure (subsection 38.04(1)).\n[23] The Court must then determine, pursuant to section 38.06, whether to confirm the prohibition on disclosure or to authorize disclosure of all or part of the information and under what conditions (subsections 38.06(1)-(3)). In doing so, the Court applies a three-part test established by this Court in Canada (Attorney General) v. Ribic, 2003 FCA 246 and restated in Canada (Attorney General) v. Khawaja, 2007 FCA 388 at paragraph 8, leave to appeal dismissed, 32397 (3 April 2008).\n[24] On the first part of the test, the party seeking disclosure of the information (usually the respondent) must establish that the redacted information is relevant (Ribic at para. 17). On the second part of the test, the onus shifts to the AGC to demonstrate that the disclosure of the information would be injurious to international relations, national defence or national security (Ribic at para. 18). If both relevance and injury are established, the party seeking disclosure of the information then bears the burden of demonstrating that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in the non-disclosure (Ribic at para. 21).\n[25] Where the Court concludes that the public interest favours disclosure, the Court may authorize, by order, disclosure in the form and under the conditions that are most likely to limit any injury resulting from disclosure (subsection 38.06(2)).\n[26] As noted above, the obligation to give notice arises when there is a possibility that sensitive or potentially injurious information will or may be disclosed in connection with a proceeding. While section 38 defines when notice must be provided, it does not prescribe the form in which the information must exist. Although the sensitive or potentially injurious information will usually be contained in a document, the obligation to give notice can also apply to oral testimony as well as audio and video recordings (Ribic at paras. 4-7; Lopes v. Canada (Attorney General), 2006 FC 347 at paras. 17, 23, upheld on appeal in Lopez v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 109). There is also no requirement that the information pre-exist in the format sought to be used in the section 38 process. As the Designated Judge properly noted, the AGC is required to review the information regardless of the format in which it is provided (Sakab #1 at para. 177). The scope of section 38 extends to all information that is anticipated to be disclosed over the course of the underlying proceeding.\n[27] The Designated Judge accepted that Al Jabri had prepared the proffer to provide the AGC all the information that was likely to be otherwise disclosed in the underlying civil action, in order to prevent a series of section 38 notices and applications as the litigation unfolded and to avoid the uncertainty about what information could be disclosed. She found that multiple section 38 applications as the litigation progressed could be more detrimental than resolving the section 38 claims at the outset. She added that, while the Court did not encourage the creation of new documents for a section 38 application, the circumstances in this case warranted such an approach (Sakab #1 at paras. 178-180; Sakab #2 at paras. 89, 92).\n[28] The Designated Judge\u2019s finding that it would be more efficient to deal with as much information as possible in one application to avoid further delays in the underlying action was an appropriate exercise of discretion regarding the section 38 process, in the circumstances.\n[29] In fact, in 2021, Al Jabri had provided to the AGC a first notice under section 38.01 which referred to sensitive information in a confidential appendix to an affidavit filed by Al Jabri on a stay motion in the OSCJ. Believing that Al Jabri might disclose sensitive or potentially injurious information in a supplementary affidavit and motion materials to be filed on a renewed stay motion in the OSCJ, an official from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service gave notice under subsection 38.01(3) of the CEA to the AGC in 2022 (the second notice). Instead of providing the AGC with a copy of his affidavit and stay materials, Al Jabri and his counsel prepared the proffer with the supporting documents and submitted them to the AGC for review. The justification for this approach was to ensure that all the information relevant to Al Jabri\u2019s defence, and potentially engaging section 38 of the CEA, would be provided for review by the AGC. Al Jabri then delivered a third notice to the AGC, which referred to the proffer and 17 supporting documents. As Al Jabri\u2019s counsel explained during a case management conference, the purpose behind the proffer was to know, once it was redacted, what information could be adduced in the underlying litigation (Appeal Book at 2330, transcript of case conference held on September 27, 2022, at 2335-2340). The first and second notices are not at issue in this appeal.\n[30] Given the number of notices already provided to the AGC and the nature of the operations in which the Sakab Parties and Al Jabri are alleged to have engaged in (counterterrorism), it was reasonably foreseeable that further section 38 notices would be required as the proceedings in the OSCJ evolved. I am satisfied that the Designated Judge properly exercised her discretion in finding that the circumstances warranted this approach.\n[31] The Designated Judge\u2019s finding is also consistent with the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada, this Court and the Federal Court.\n[32] In Canada (Attorney General) v. Nuttall, 2016 FC 850, the Federal Court cautioned against a \u201ccontinuing cycle of disclosure orders\u201d, especially in light of the delay inherent in the bifurcated section 38 process (Nuttall at paras. 78-79).\n[33] In Ribic, this Court expressed concern over an approach that would lead to disclosure in multiple stages:\n[51] The two witnesses asserted that they are incapable of separating sensitive from non-sensitive information ... If they were to testify in the criminal trial, the trial would have to be suspended every time a question would be put to the witnesses in order to determine whether the question would lead to the disclosure of sensitive information and, if so, whether that sensitive information should be revealed. For this last determination, it involves coming back to the Federal Court. \u2026\n[34] In R v. Ahmad, 2011 SCC 6, the Supreme Court of Canada noted that \u201c[s]ection 38 of the CEA places an obligation on all participants to a legal proceeding, as well as non-participating officials, to notify the Attorney General of the possibility that sensitive or potentially injurious information will be disclosed\u201d (Ahmad at para. 17, my emphasis). It further held that the scheme under section 38 of the CEA was \u201cdesigned to operate flexibly\u201d (Ahmad at para. 44). In discussing the issue of potential delays caused by the bifurcation of proceedings, the Supreme Court stated as follows:\nAn important step the parties can take is attempting to identify potential national security issues during pre-trial proceedings. This would allow the disclosure arguments to take place at an early date. Section 38 encourages early-stage disclosure proceedings \u2026 Due diligence in this respect will work to minimize the risk of mistrials. Disclosure by the Crown in a series of stages over a period of time, each new stage of disclosure triggering additional s. 38 proceedings, will heighten the risk of resort by the trial judge to s. 38 remedies.\n(Ahmad at para. 77)\n[35] While Ahmad involved the disclosure of information in the context of a criminal prosecution, I see no reason why the same reasoning would not apply in the context of civil proceedings, as the Federal Court held in Canada (Attorney General) v. Telbani, 2014 FC 1050 at paragraph 110.\n[36] The Sakab Parties submit \u201cthis Court has declined to review information under s. 38 that is not yet at an imminent risk of disclosure.\u201d To support their preferred approach, they rely on Ottawa Citizen Group Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 FC 1052 (Appellant\u2019s Memorandum of Fact and Law at para. 79, footnote 81).\n[37] In my view, their reliance on this decision is misguided.\n[38] Ottawa Citizen is a decision of the Federal Court. In that case, the applicants had filed an application before a judge of the Ontario Court of Justice to terminate or vary a sealing order she had previously made in respect of seven search warrants. Counsel for the AGC was notified that the documents in issue contained sensitive or potentially injurious information as defined in section 38 of the CEA. The applicants initiated a section 38 application in the Federal Court and sought an order authorizing the disclosure of the information in issue. The Designated Judge adjourned the section 38 proceeding as a matter of judicial economy, pending the determination of the motion to vary the sealing order in the Ontario Court of Justice. The Designated Judge found that, if the judge of the Ontario Court of Justice refused to vary her sealing order, it was likely that there would be no reason to continue the section 38 application. He also noted that, if she agreed to further vary her sealing order and the AGC no longer objected to making the information public, then again, the proceeding would likely not be necessary (at paras. 20-21, 25).\n[39] In my view, Ottawa Citizen does not stand for the proposition that section 38 proceedings are limited to information at imminent risk of disclosure. On the contrary, it confirms the flexibility designated judges enjoy in determining section 38 applications.\n[40] Like the Designated Judge, I agree that the creation of new documents for a section 38 application should not be encouraged. However, the situation is not unprecedented. In Canada (Attorney General) v. Ortis, 2022 FC 142, Mr. Ortis was a civilian employee of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who, in connection with his employment, had access to classified information from a variety of sources, including international partners (Ortis at paras. 2-3). He was charged with a number of offences under the Security of Information Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. O-5 and the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. Crown disclosure provided to Mr. Ortis was redacted and the AGC applied under section 38.04 for an order confirming the claims for the prohibition of disclosure.\n[41] Since Mr. Ortis had been privy to the classified documents, he was able to recall some of their redacted content. It was recognized that Mr. Ortis needed to be able to discuss the classified information with his defence counsel in order to prepare for trial. Arrangements were made for Mr. Ortis to consult with and instruct his counsel in a secure fashion. To assist the Court, Mr. Ortis\u2019 counsel, who was security cleared, provided a summary of the evidence that Mr. Ortis wished to provide at his trial in his own defence. This information was not sworn or affirmed. The AGC reviewed the information and redacted portions of the defence summary on section 38 grounds. The summary of Mr. Ortis\u2019 anticipated evidence was made available to the AGC and the amici curiae, but was withheld from counsel with the Public Prosecution Service of Canada (PPSC), who had carriage of the prosecution on behalf of the Crown. Mr. Ortis eventually agreed to share with the PPSC parts of the defence summary that related to specific counts, but did so in part to facilitate the Crown\u2019s consideration of whether those charges should be stayed on the grounds that he could not have a fair trial (Ortis at paras. 17-24).\n[42] The Designated Judge in Ortis noted that the defence summary \u201cwas in effect an advance vetting of Mr. Ortis\u2019s anticipated trial evidence for objections to disclosure under the section 38 scheme\u201d (Ortis at para. 7). He further observed at paragraph 39:\nWhile this complicated the work of the AGC and the Court somewhat, proceeding in this fashion ultimately enhanced the efficiency and consistency of the Court\u2019s determinations under subsection 38.06(2) of the CEA. Dealing at this stage with objections to the disclosure of certain information Mr. Ortis wishes to provide at trial should also go a long way in minimizing any disruption to the trial because of section 38 concerns.\n[43] As in Ortis, the Designated Judge here accepted that Al Jabri was seeking to vet in advance his potential defence to the fraud action. Furthermore, similarly to Mr. Ortis, who relied on his right to silence vis-\u00e0-vis the Crown, Al Jabri is placing restrictions on who may access his anticipated defence by invoking litigation privilege.\n[44] The Sakab Parties\u2019 reliance on paragraph 38.01(6)(a) of the CEA is equally misplaced. While section 38.01 of the CEA imposes notice requirements regarding the disclosure of sensitive or potentially injurious information, subsection 38.01(6) sets out certain exceptions. One such exception is when a person discloses the information to their solicitor in connection with a proceeding if the information is relevant to that proceeding (para. 38.01(6)(a)). In such a situation, the person is not required to give notice to the AGC.\n[45] However, this exception does not preclude the requirement to give notice under section 38.01 of the CEA where there is a possibility that the sensitive or potentially injurious information will or may be disclosed in a proceeding. In this case, as previously noted, the Designated Judge accepted that Al Jabri had prepared the proffer to provide all the information that was likely to be disclosed in the course of the underlying civil proceeding to the AGC for review. He was thus required to give notice to the AGC and the section 38 process was triggered.\n[46] As I stated above, the Designated Judge\u2019s conclusion that the proffer was appropriate in the circumstances of this section 38 application is a proper exercise of discretion, which warrants this Court\u2019s deference on appeal.\n[47] The Sakab Parties have failed to convince me that the Designated Judge either erred in law or committed a palpable and overriding error in concluding that the proffer could be the subject of proceedings under section 38 of the CEA.\nB. No Unfairness or Abuse of Process [48] As noted above, the Sakab Parties submit that the Designated Judge erred in finding that she did not have jurisdiction to decide the litigation privilege claim or to order the production of the redacted proffer.\n[49] Even if I were to assume that the Designated Judge erred in interpreting the scope of her jurisdiction, I do not find that such error would be determinative of the outcome of the appeal in light of her conclusions on the issues of fairness and abuse of process, such that the production of the redacted proffer to the Sakab Parties was not warranted.\n[50] Before the Designated Judge, the Sakab Parties submitted that the section 38 process would be unfair and constitute an abuse of process unless the redacted proffer was provided to them. They argued that in an effort to exclude the Sakab Parties from the process, Al Jabri deliberately created the proffer and asserted litigation privilege over it to prevent them from receiving the redacted proffer. They maintained that but for the cloak of litigation privilege, they would receive the redacted proffer and could glean information that would guide them in their relevancy submissions under the Ribic test. They claimed that without the redacted proffer, they would be left in the dark and could not meaningfully participate in the section 38 proceedings, such that the Court would be unable to determine relevance and conduct the necessary balancing at the third stage of the Ribic test. They asserted that the Court has a broad responsibility to ensure fairness in national security matters due to the closed nature of the proceedings and that this obligation includes ensuring that the section 38 process is fair.\n[51] The Designated Judge found that there had not yet been any abuse of process that would engage the Court\u2019s inherent power to control its own process. She also held that she was confident she could fairly determine the section 38 application (Sakab #1 at para. 168; Sakab #2 at para. 107).\n[52] In making these determinations, the Designated Judge rejected the argument that the Sakab Parties were excluded from the section 38 process (Sakab #1 at paras. 168, 182). She considered that they could make public submissions and could request to make additional public or ex parte submissions pursuant to subsection 38.11(2) of the CEA. She also found that the Sakab Parties had sufficient information to make submissions about why the information was not relevant or essential to Al Jabri\u2019s defence. In particular, she noted the extensive record from which the Sakab Parties could discern Al Jabri\u2019s position in the underlying litigation and the nature of the information likely subject to the section 38 application (Sakab #1 at paras. 183-184).\n[53] Likewise, she found that the Court would have a sufficient grasp of the underlying litigation and key issues to determine the relevance of the information in the proffer, given the volume of documents submitted by the Sakab Parties, including their submissions. She further added that, to the extent that the Sakab Parties did not know or could not anticipate what information may be in the proffer, there was also the option of sharing some of the redacted information with the presiding judge in the OSCJ in a summary way or under strict conditions, without disclosure to the Sakab Parties (Sakab #1 at paras. 187-188).\n[54] In addition, the Designated Judge found that if the Sakab Parties did not receive the redacted proffer, they would be in a position similar to a respondent in a section 38 application who receives a heavily redacted document, yet still makes general submissions about the relevance or irrelevance of that information. Recognizing that this may be a challenge for such respondents, she stated that it was one inherent in the section 38 process (Sakab #1 at para. 190). In responding to the argument that any document filed should be shared with all parties, she noted that the provision or exchange of information would occur in the context of the underlying litigation (Sakab #1 at para. 191).\n[55] The Designated Judge did not accept the argument that litigation privilege could not attach to the proffer because the proffer had been provided to the AGC. She held that the AGC was not in a typically adversarial role, and was only fulfilling his role to review the information for the purposes of determining whether the sensitive and potentially injurious information could be disclosed (Sakab #1 at para. 192).\n[56] The Designated Judge further rejected the argument that the creation of the proffer was unfair because it contains \u201csecret submissions\u201d about the relevance of the information, thus giving Al Jabri an advantage by providing ex parte submissions to the Court in advance of any public hearing. She found that Al Jabri\u2019s description of the proffer did not equate to secret submissions but added that, given the Sakab Parties\u2019 allegation, the Court would be alert to this concern (Sakab #1 at para. 193). She also found that there was no need in this case for \u201csecret submissions.\u201d She would hear in a public hearing submissions from Al Jabri on the relevance of the information he seeks to have disclosed, and would similarly hear submissions from the Sakab Parties on the irrelevance of the information. In both cases, they could request to make additional public and\/or ex parte submissions (Sakab #1 at para. 195).\n[57] The Designated Judge acknowledged that the circumstances of this application differed from those in some section 38 applications where the redacted documents are provided to one or more respondents before submissions are made to the Court, but found that the different circumstances did not amount to unfairness (Sakab #1 at para. 196). In her view, the alleged unfairness could be addressed by the role of the amicus curiae, the AGC\u2019s duty of candour and the Court\u2019s responsibilities in designated proceedings to carefully scrutinize the documents and consider all submissions (Sakab #1 at para. 197). She added that she was alive to the Court\u2019s duty to ensure fairness, and that if the Court had concerns that the position of the Sakab Parties had not been well articulated, she could invite them to make additional public submissions, including through responses to tailored questions from the Court formulated to protect sensitive or potentially injurious information (Sakab #1 at paras. 198, 204). The Designated Judge was satisfied that she could fairly determine the section 38 application (Sakab #2 at para. 107).\n[58] To some degree, the Sakab Parties reiterate the same arguments before this Court. In essence, they are concerned that there is a real risk that the Designated Judge will approach the Ribic framework without a full and proper appreciation of the issues raised in the underlying civil proceeding.\n[59] Contrary to the submission of the Sakab Parties, the Designated Judge\u2019s reasons clearly demonstrate that she understood that they were seeking disclosure of the redacted proffer for the purposes of the section 38 proceedings, not the underlying proceeding.\n[60] I acknowledge that the process followed in the section 38 proceedings is unusual and may not be ideal to the Sakab Parties. However, as this Court noted in Ribic, \u201c\u2018unusual\u2019 is not necessarily synonymous with \u2018unfair\u2019\u201d (Ribic at para. 42).\n[61] As the Supreme Court and this Court have often stated, the notion of fairness depends entirely on the circumstances and the context (Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Chiarelli, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 711 at 743-744; Ruby v. Canada (Solicitor General), 2002 SCC 75 at paras. 39\u201040; Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 SCC 9 at para. 57; Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 SCC 38 at para. 56; Ribic at paras. 42, 45; Khawaja at paras. 29-30, 120).\n[62] Not only does the Designated Judge have a general power to control the Court\u2019s process, subsection 38.04(5) of the CEA provides them with discretion over various aspects of the section 38 process. For example, the Designated Judge decides whether it is necessary to hold a hearing (para. 38.04(5)(b)) and, if the judge \u201cconsiders it appropriate in the circumstances, may give any person the opportunity to make representations\u201d (para. 38.04(5)(d)).\n[63] In the circumstances of this application, I find that the section 38 process is sufficiently flexible to allow the Designated Judge to make a fair determination of the nature of the information at issue. The Sakab Parties have had the opportunity to make representations on the relevancy prong of the Ribic test. To do so, they have had access to a comprehensive record in the underlying proceeding from which they could discern Al Jabri\u2019s defence. Furthermore, the Sakab Parties would have received written submissions from Al Jabri on the redacted information\u2019s relevance to the underlying proceeding.\n[64] Moreover, by the time the second prong of the Ribic test will be completed, they will likely have examined Al Jabri for discovery and have elicited some of the facts they allege are contained in the proffer. If they acquire information they feel should be shared with the Designated Judge, they can request a further public hearing or request an ex parte hearing to advance their position in the absence of the other parties. The amicus curiae will also have access to the proffer and can assist the Designated Judge in reaching a fair decision.\n[65] In addition, I accept the Designated Judge\u2019s conclusion that, given the extensive record filed and submissions received from the Sakab Parties and Al Jabri, she should have a sufficient grasp of the key issues in the underlying litigation to determine the relevance and public interest prongs of the Ribic test. One must keep in mind that designated judges regularly determine section 38 applications where one of the parties does not have all the information. If the Designated Judge finds that she requires more context to assist in her determination, she may order the production of additional information (Nuttall at paras. 77-78). In the event the Sakab Parties are unsatisfied with the Designated Judge\u2019s findings on relevance in the context of the section 38 application, they are not precluded from making arguments about the relevance of the evidence to the trier of fact in the civil proceedings.\n[66] I also find that the Designated Judge\u2019s decision preserves litigation fairness in the underlying proceeding. If the redacted proffer were provided to the Sakab Parties in the course of the section 38 proceedings, they would in effect be obtaining early disclosure of information to which they may not yet be entitled in the underlying proceeding. Litigation privilege is intended to ensure a zone of privacy in which the parties may consider and prepare their cases without a requirement of premature disclosure or without adversarial interference (Blank v. Canada (Minister of Justice), 2006 SCC 39 at paras. 27, 34, 41). The Designated Judge accepted that the proffer was created for the purpose of the underlying fraud litigation in the OSCJ (Sakab #2 at para. 92).\n[67] The Designated Judge\u2019s findings regarding the Sakab Parties\u2019 allegations of abuse of process and unfairness and her conclusion that they need not have a copy of the redacted proffer for the purpose of the section 38 process constitute an appropriate exercise of her discretion in managing fairness to all parties in the process. The Sakab Parties have not demonstrated that the Designated Judge erred in law or committed a palpable and overriding error in exercising her discretion.\nIII. Conclusion [68] For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that the Designated Judge did not err in law or make a palpable and overriding error in concluding that the proffer could be the subject of proceedings under section 38 of the CEA and in rejecting the allegations of abuse of process and unfairness. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal without costs, as none were sought by the respondents.\n\"Sylvie E. Roussel\"\nJ.A.\n\u201cI agree.\nJohn B.

The Interlocutory Order permitted the Underlying Application to continue under a timetable that differed from the one proposed by the applicant. The proposed appeal of the Interlocutory Order has been assigned in this Court as file number 24-A-9.\n[3] The second Order is an Order rendered on August 10, 2023, which dismissed the Underlying Application on the ground that the applicant had failed to comply with the Interlocutory Order and that it was not in the interests of justice to grant a further extension of time to allow him to perfect his application record (the Final Order). The proposed appeal of the Final Order has been assigned in this Court as file number 24-A-8.\n[4] The authority to extend the time to bring an appeal before this Court is grounded in paragraph 27(2) of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-7 (the Act). The test for obtaining such an extension is well known. It requires the Court to consider whether: (i) the proposed appellant had a continuing intention to pursue the appeal; (ii) there is some merit to the proposed appeal; (iii) the proposed respondent has been prejudiced by the delay; and (iv) the proposed appellant has a reasonable explanation for the delay (Canada (Attorney General) v. Hennelly, 167 F.T.R. 158 (FCA)). It is well established as well that these factors (the Hennelly Factors) are intended to assist the Court in determining whether an extension of time is warranted in a given set of circumstances, none of them being determinative (Alberta v. Canada, 2018 FCA 83 at para. 45). As stated in Canada (Attorney General) v. Larkman, 2012 FCA 204 (Larkman), the overriding consideration in such matters \u201cis that the interests of justice be served\u201d (Larkman at para. 62).\n[5] Here, the applicant makes essentially the same submissions in both instances. They can be summarized as follows: ongoing health and financial problems prevented him from acting in a timely fashion; nonetheless, the notice of appeal in each instance was filed within the prescribed time but unethical behaviour on the part of the Court\u2019s Registry illegally delayed or withheld the proposed appeals.\n[6] Because of the nature of the impugned Orders and the procedural background to each proposed appeal, the present motions for an extension of time requires a separate \u2013 and different \u2013 response.\nA. Court File 24-A-8 [7] According to the record in this Court, the applicant did submit for filing a notice of appeal against the Final Order on September 5, 2023, that is, within the prescribed time. However, it could not be accepted for filing because the applicant did not pay the associated filing fee, as he was required to do pursuant to Rule 19 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106 (the Rules). The notice of appeal was returned to him pending a decision on the proposed motion for waiver of these fees. Such motion was filed by the applicant but rejected by Order of this Court dated December 19, 2023 (the December Order). According to the December Order, the notice of appeal previously submitted for filing was to be accepted by the Registry provided the applicant paid the filing fees no later than January 8, 2024. In such a scenario, the notice of appeal would have an effective filing date \u201con or after the day the filing fee is paid, but in no event later than January 9, 2024\u201d.\n[8] Contrary to what was the case for the proposed appeal of the Interlocutory Order, there was nothing in the December Order subjecting the filing of the notice of appeal to a successful motion for an extension of time.\n[9] On January 23, 2024, the applicant submitted a new motion for a waiver of fees. That motion was granted by Order of this Court dated March 1, 2024 (the March Order) based on new evidence submitted by the applicant concerning his financial and health situations. However, the March Order provided that if the applicant wished to pursue an appeal of the Final Order, he would have to seek an extension of time by March 24, 2024. This is what the applicant did by filing the present motion within that timeline.\n[10] There is certainly no evidence on record \u2013 and I want this to be clear \u2013 of any impropriety on the part of the Court\u2019s Registry in handling both proposed appeals. The applicant\u2019s allegations in that regard are simply unfounded. According to Rules 71, 71.1 and 72 of the Rules, documents that are sent to the Registry for the purpose of filing are first submitted for filing. One of the conditions for filing is the payment of the associated fee (Rule 71.1(1)(b)). A document submitted for filing is either accepted for filing or referred to a judge or an associate-judge for directions when the Court\u2019s Administrator is of the opinion that the document is not in the form required by the Rules or that other conditions precedent to its filing have not been fulfilled. The non-payment of the associated fee would be one of these conditions. In other words, submitting a document for filing and the actual filing of the document are two different things under the Rules. Here, the Registry only did what the Rules required them to do.\n[11] That said, I am of the view that an extension of time is warranted in light of the particular circumstances that led to the filing of the present motion insofar as it relates to the proposed appeal of the Final Order. The applicant has certainly shown a continuing intention to pursue this appeal and there is no evidence that the proposed respondent has suffered prejudice from the delay. As for the justification for the delay, one could say that it only became clear on March 1, 2024, that an extension of time would be required to enable the applicant to pursue this appeal. There is, therefore, in my view, a reasonable explanation for the delay, especially when one considers that the applicant submitted a notice of appeal for filing within the prescribed time. This is so as well, when one considers that the December Order made no reference to the requirement to seek an extension of time in order to enable the applicant to pursue his appeal of the Final Order; quite the opposite.\n[12] The proposed respondent insists that the proposed appeal of the Final Order is devoid of any merit. As the Court stated in Larkman, quoting from Grewal v. Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration), [1985] 2 F.C. 263 (C.A.), \u201ca compelling explanation for the delay may lead to a positive response even if the case against the judgment appears weak\u201d (Larkman at para. 62).\n[13] This is the case here. In view of the particular circumstances outlined above, I believe that the interests of justice would be better served by permitting the applicant to pursue his appeal of the Final Order.\nB. Court File 24-A-9 [14] I am unable to reach the same conclusion with respect to the proposed appeal of the Interlocutory Order. The proposed respondent claims that the doctrine of issue estoppel precludes the applicant from re-litigating this issue as the March Order rejected a similar request on the ground that the applicant\u2019s record did not address the Hennelly Factors \u201cto the extent necessary to show that the interests of justice will be served by granting the extension\u201d.\n[15] However, I do not need to decide that argument because even considering the more detailed submissions offered by the applicant on this issue in the present motion, I conclude that the interests of justice will not be served by granting the extension with respect to the Interlocutory Order.\n[16] Contrary to what is the case of the notice of appeal respecting the Final Order, the notice of appeal regarding the Interlocutory Order was not submitted for filing within the prescribed time. According to paragraph 27(2)(a) of the Act, the notice of appeal respecting the Interlocutory Order had to be filed within 10 days after the pronouncement of the Order, that is no later than June 12, 2023. The applicant only submitted his notice of appeal for filing on August 30, 2023, which is more than two and a half months past that deadline. Contrary to the applicant\u2019s assertion, the \u201cJuly\/August\u201d rule applicable to the computation of the appeal period for judgments other than interlocutory decisions is irrelevant here for two reasons. First, pursuant to paragraph 27(2) of the Act, it does not apply to interlocutory decisions. Second, even if applicable to such decisions, it would not have assisted the applicant because the delay for appealing the Interlocutory Order expired in June.\n[17] Therefore, in such context, I am not satisfied that the applicant has shown a continuing intention to pursue the appeal of the Interlocutory Order, nor that he has provided a reasonable explanation for the delay between June 12 and August 30, 2023. Neither has he shown that there is any merit to his proposed appeal of the Interlocutory Order which permitted him to pursue the Underlying Application. This proposed appeal has all the looks of an afterthought, prompted by the Final Order denying the applicant\u2019s requests at the time, including changes to the procedural timetable set out in the Interlocutory Order.\n[18] Finally, Rule 352, relied on by the applicant \u201cif necessary\u201d, is irrelevant as it applies to appeals that can only be commenced with leave of the Court, which is not the case here. Rule 352 leave applications are not to be conflated with motions for an extension of time. They are not the same.\n[19] For all these reasons, the motion for an extension of time respecting the proposed appeal of the Interlocutory Order will be dismissed, whereas the one respecting the proposed appeal of the Final Order will be granted.\n[20] I note that the March Order waived the fees payable for the filing of a notice of appeal of the Final Order, provided an extension of time was granted, which is the case now. The March Order also ordered that the notice of appeal that was submitted for filing by the applicant be returned to him. In these circumstances, the applicant will have ten (10) days from the date of the Order to be released simultaneously with these reasons in file number 24-A-8, that is until, but no later than, May 23, 2024, to submit his notice of appeal for filing. This will be reflected in said Order.\n[21] Neither party sought their costs. None will be awarded.\n[22] A copy of these reasons for order will be filed in file number 24-A-9 as reasons therein.\n\"Ren\u00e9 LeBlanc\"\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\n24-A-8\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMIGUEL ANGEL MONTANO GUTIERREZ v.

In one, the Federal Court dismissed the appellant\u2019s motion for waiver of court fees. In the other, the Federal Court struck the appellant\u2019s statement of claim without leave to amend.\n[2] In our view, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\n[3] The Federal Court made no reviewable errors. In the case of the denial of the extension of time, the Federal Court set out the correct legal test and exercised its discretion without committing palpable and overriding error: Canada (Attorney General) v. Larkman, 2012 FCA 204, 433 N.R. 184; Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. The same can be said for the Federal Court\u2019s denial of a waiver of filing fees. In particular, palpable and overriding error is a difficult test to meet: Benhaim v. St\u2011Germain, 2016 SCC 48, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 352, citing Canada v. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 FCA 165, 4 B.L.R. (5th) 31.\n[4] As well, we see no procedural unfairness. To the contrary, procedural errors by the appellant were frequently overlooked in order to move this case to adjudication on the merits.\n[5] In this Court, the appellant brought a motion seeking two forms of relief: the right to raise new constitutional issues and leave to file fresh evidence. We will dismiss the motion. The appellant seeks to raise constitutional issues under sections 7, 15 and 24(1) of the Charter for the first time on appeal. In doing so, she seeks to argue in this Court the merits of the matter before the Federal Court. But that is not before us. The only issues in this appeal are whether the Federal Court committed reviewable errors in denying the appellant an extension of time. In these circumstances, the new issues are not admissible in this appeal: Quan v. Cusson, 2009 SCC 62, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 712; Performance Industries Ltd. v. Sylvan Lake Golf & Tennis Club Ltd., 2002 SCC 19, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 678.\n[6] As for the fresh evidence, this Court has previously rejected the appellant\u2019s similar efforts to introduce fresh evidence into this appeal, those previous rulings cannot be appealed to this panel (Ignace v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 239), and, in any event, the appellant has not satisfied any of the branches of the test for the admission of fresh evidence on appeal set out in Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759.\n[7] Therefore, we will dismiss the motion and the appeal with costs fixed in the amount of $1,500, all-inclusive.\n\u201cDavid Stratas\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDocket:\nA-239-22\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nWENDY SIN MING HO v.

These benefits are governed by the Public Service Dental Care Plan (the Dental Plan), the terms of which are negotiated by the parties from time to time.\n[2] The most recent iteration of the Dental Plan expired in December of 2021. Shortly thereafter, PSAC gave notice to the Treasury Board (the employer) that it wished to negotiate amendments to the Dental Plan. An exchange of correspondence between the parties then followed. Dissatisfied with the position taken by the employer, PSAC filed a complaint with the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board (the Board) under section 190 of the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 2. It alleged in its complaint that the employer had committed an unfair labour practice contrary to section 106 of the Act by failing to bargain in good faith. The full text of the statutory provisions at issue in this case is attached as an appendix to these reasons.\n[3] The employer disputed the Board\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain PSAC\u2019s complaint, asserting that the duty to bargain in good faith relates only to the negotiation of collective agreements and that the Dental Plan was not a \u201ccollective agreement\u201d as defined in the Act. It further submitted that the negotiation of the Dental Plan did not take place under section 105 of the Act, as this allows a bargaining agent or an employer to give written notice to the other side requiring them to commence bargaining collectively with a view to entering into, renewing or revising a collective agreement. According to the employer, section 106 of the Act (which creates the duty to bargain in good faith) also has no application here, as that duty is only engaged once notice to bargain collectively has been given pursuant to section 105. Consequently, the employer argued that the Board lacked jurisdiction to deal with PSAC\u2019s complaint and that it should be dismissed.\n[4] In the alternative, the employer argued that, in any event, it had not breached its duty to bargain in good faith in this case. The employer has not pursued this issue before us.\n[5] In a lengthy and detailed decision, the Board carefully considered the employer\u2019s jurisdictional arguments. It accepted that the Dental Plan was not a \u201ccollective agreement\u201d, as defined in the Act, and that PSAC could not serve a \u201cnotice to bargain\u201d under section 105 of the Act with respect to the Plan. The Board further found that the section 106 duty to bargain in good faith was only triggered once a \u201cnotice to bargain\u201d had been served in accordance with section 105 of the Act. It also found that, on its face, paragraph 190(1)(b) of the Act only gave the Board jurisdiction to inquire into complaints alleging that a party had failed to comply with the duty to bargain in good faith imposed by section 106 of the Act. The Board acknowledged that there is no provision in section 190 that expressly allowed it to decide complaints with respect to an alleged failure to bargain in good faith where section 106 had not been engaged.\n[6] That said, the Board did not accept the employer\u2019s contention that the parties negotiate the terms of the Dental Plan outside of the collective bargaining process. Considering the relationship between the Dental Plan and collective bargaining, the Board found as a fact that the Plan exists because the parties negotiated for it through the collective bargaining process. The Board further found that the Dental Plan had been incorporated by reference into the parties\u2019 collective agreements (which state that the Plan is \u201cdeemed to form part of\u201d these agreements) and that it was \u201centirely rooted in the collective bargaining process between the parties\u201d. The Board also noted that PSAC had served notices to bargain collectively under section 105 of the Act with respect to five of its collective agreements, and that these notices had triggered the section 106 duty to bargain collective agreements in good faith. Given that the Dental Plan is deemed to form part of these agreements, negotiating its terms during the collective bargaining process meant that these negotiations must also engage the duty to bargain in good faith. These findings led the Board to conclude that having regard to the specific facts of this case, the employer\u2019s obligation to bargain in good faith had been engaged, and that the employer had breached that duty.\n[7] The Board then went on to consider whether the duty to bargain in good faith would be engaged even if the negotiation of the terms of the Dental Plan took place at a time when the collective agreements between the parties remained in force. In concluding that the duty would be triggered in such circumstances, the Board had regard to numerous factors including the principles of statutory interpretation, the wording of the Act\u2019s Preamble, the purpose of the legislation, the constitutional nature of the right to bargain collectively and the relevant jurisprudence.\n[8] We agree with the parties that the Board\u2019s jurisdictional finding is subject to review on the reasonableness standard: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at paras. 16, 65. As the Supreme Court has stated, a reasonable decision is one \u201cbased on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis [\u2026] that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker\u201d: Vavilov, above at para. 85.\n[9] The employer has not demonstrated that the Board\u2019s findings that the Dental Plan existed because the parties had negotiated for it through the collective bargaining process, that it had been incorporated by reference into the parties\u2019 collective agreements and that it was \u201centirely rooted in the collective bargaining process between the parties\u201d were unreasonable. Given these findings, it was reasonably open to the Board to conclude that there was a duty on the part of the employer to negotiate the terms of the Dental Plan in good faith, thus engaging the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. This is further supported by the fact that, in this case, the complaint arose in the context of ongoing negotiations with respect new collective agreements between the parties. The Board\u2019s decision on the jurisdictional question was thus justified, transparent, and intelligible, and no basis has been established for this Court\u2019s intervention.\n[10] After concluding that a duty on the part of the employer to bargain in good faith had been established on the facts of this particular case, the Board went on to find that there would be a similar duty on the part of the employer where negotiations with respect to the terms of the Dental Plan take place while collective agreements between the parties are in force. It is not necessary for us to address the reasonableness of the Board\u2019s finding on this point as it was obiter on these facts, and nothing in these reasons should be taken as agreeing or disagreeing with the Board\u2019s finding in this regard.\n[11] Consequently, the application will be dismissed. In accordance with the agreement of the parties, PSAC shall have its costs fixed in the amount of $2,500.00.\n\u201cAnne L.

The Employment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996, c. 23, at section 31, provides that benefits are not payable during a period of suspension where the suspension is due to the claimant\u2019s misconduct. At the time of the applicant\u2019s suspension, he was employed by GardaWorld as a screening officer at Pearson International Airport in Toronto.\n[3] The applicant appealed the matter to the General Division of the Social Security Tribunal. In a decision dated March 8, 2023, the General Division concluded that the applicant was properly denied employment insurance benefits because he was suspended as a result of misconduct. The conclusion was based on three findings: (1) the actions of the applicant led to his suspension; (2) he acted deliberately; and (3) the applicant knew that refusing to say whether he was vaccinated was likely to result in the suspension.\n[4] The applicant further appealed to the Appeal Division which upheld the decision of the General Division. The Appeal Division determined that the General Division applied the right test of misconduct. It also determined that the General Division did not err by not considering the applicant\u2019s collective bargaining agreement or whether the employer could impose new conditions of employment.\n[5] The applicant filed an application for judicial review in this Court where he raised several arguments.\n[6] The applicant submits that his actions did not amount to misconduct, because the conduct was not deliberate and the vaccination policy did not have any bearing on his ability to perform job functions. It appears that these issues were not raised before the Appeal Division because it did not mention them in its reasons which were detailed. In these circumstances, it is not appropriate for this Court to consider them on judicial review (Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. Alberta Teachers\u2019 Association, 2011 SCC 61 at para. 23).\n[7] The applicant also suggests that the Appeal Division erred by failing to consider Charter protections. The Appeal Division found that there were several flaws with this submission. We will simply mention two.\n[8] First, the Appeal Division found that the Social Security Tribunal did not have the authority to consider the constitutionality of the vaccination policy. This conclusion is supported by court authorities and is reasonable. In a recent decision of this Court, Sullivan v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 7, at paragraph 12, the Court commented that \u201cCharter values cannot be used to invalidate legislative provisions that administrative decision-makers must follow, such as, in this case, section 30 of the Employment Insurance Act. \u2026 [T]he Social Security Tribunal was reasonable in holding that the applicant was precluded under that section and related court jurisprudence from questioning the appropriateness of the termination of his employment.\u201d The same principle applies to section 31 of the Employment Insurance Act which is applicable here.\n[9] Second, the Appeal Division found that the applicant had not detailed his constitutional arguments. Such detail is required. As noted in Sullivan, at paragraph 8, \u201c[A]ll Charter arguments, whether based on rights, freedoms or values must be supported by a rich evidentiary record \u2026\u201d\n[10] In light of these principles, the Appeal Division\u2019s decision concerning constitutional arguments was reasonable.\n[11] Further, the applicant submits that there was no misconduct because the employer\u2019s vaccination policy was invalid for failure to comply with employment-related law. We are of the view that the Appeal Division\u2019s rejection of this submission was reasonable. The Appeal Division concluded that issues of wrongful dismissal were not relevant in determining whether there has been misconduct for purposes of the Employment Insurance Act. In making this finding, the Appeal Division properly relied on the decision of this Court in Karelia v. Canada (Human Resources and Skills Development), 2012 FCA 140. The principle is well-established (Karelia at para. 20) and continues to be regularly applied by this Court in cases similar to this (Kuk v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 74, at para.9).\n[12] The applicant also submits that the common law test of misconduct must evolve. However, this issue is not available on this judicial review which is subject to reasonableness review (Francis v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 217 at para. 14).\n[13] Finally, at this hearing the applicant raised for the first time some additional issues that are not relevant to the judicial review application because the issues were not discussed in the decision under review and it appears that they were not raised in that forum. We decline to comment on these issues.\n[14] In conclusion, we are all of the view that there is no reason to interfere with the decision of the Appeal Division. The application will be dismissed, without costs.\n\u201cJudith Woods\u201d\nJ.A.\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\nDOCKET:\nA-269-23\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nALEXEY KHODYKIN v.

BENNETT\nAppellant\nand\nMINISTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS\nRespondent\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nROUSSEL J.A.\n[1] Mr. Bennett appeals a judgment of the Federal Court (2023 FC 761), dated May 31, 2023, dismissing his appeal from an order of an associate judge acting as a case management judge. In her order dated February 21, 2023, the case management judge dismissed Mr. Bennett\u2019s action for failing to show cause following the issuance of a status review order. The underlying action, which was introduced in February 2021, relates to the importation of a motorhome purchased by Mr. Bennett in the United States, seized by the Canada Border Services Agency for failure to comply with the reporting requirements under section 12 of the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (2nd Supp.).\n[2] After stating the law on status review and outlining the history of the proceeding as well as the positions of the parties, the case management judge found that Mr. Bennett\u2019s justification for failing to move his action forward was wholly unsatisfactory, lacking in substance and unsupported by the evidentiary record. In addition, she did not accept his argument that the delays and failure to adhere to the Court\u2019s orders and direction resulted from his lack of legal counsel, finding that for much of the proceeding, he was consulting with counsel and, in any event, he had the obligation to acquaint himself with the Court\u2019s rules of procedure. Finally, she found that the measures proposed by Mr. Bennett to move the case forward were inadequate and was not persuaded that he recognized his responsibility to diligently proceed with the remaining steps in the proceeding. Concluding that it was not in the interests of justice to permit the action to proceed, she dismissed the action for delay and for failure to comply with the orders and direction of the Court.\n[3] On appeal, the Federal Court considered Mr. Bennett\u2019s submissions and the case management judge\u2019s findings. The Federal Court disagreed with Mr. Bennett that there had been a breach of procedural fairness regarding the acceptance of an affidavit filed by the Minister, noting that Mr. Bennett could have filed a reply objecting to its acceptance or tendered his own affidavit. The Federal Court also found that the case management judge had not made any palpable or overriding error justifying the Court\u2019s intervention. The Federal Court was not persuaded that the delays and non-compliance resulted from Mr. Bennett\u2019s status as a self-represented litigant and his diminished cognitive abilities. Observing that case management judges enjoy ample discretion in managing cases and that they are in the best position to decide whether it is in the interests of justice to allow a matter to proceed on status review, the Federal Court dismissed Mr. Bennett\u2019s appeal.\n[4] Before this Court, Mr. Bennett challenges the Federal Court\u2019s decision on several grounds. He raises a number of errors allegedly committed by the Federal Court and the case management judge relating to his status as a self-represented litigant, the characterization of the history of the proceedings, the application of the test for dismissing a claim on status review and the refusal to admit medical evidence. He also makes allegations of bias and breaches of procedural fairness on the part of both the Federal Court and the case management judge.\n[5] The first issue I must decide is whether the Federal Court erred in law or made a palpable and overriding error in reviewing the discretionary order of the case management judge. The same standard applies when the Federal Court is reviewing the discretionary decision of an associate judge (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33; Hospira Healthcare Corporation v. Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, 2016 FCA 215 at paras. 64-65, 79; Nova-Biorubber Green Technologies Inc. v. Sustainable Development Technology Canada, 2022 FCA 121 at para. 5). Second, I must determine, in relation to the procedural fairness issues raised, whether the process leading to the decisions was fair in all of the circumstances (Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 at paras. 54-55).\n[6] After carefully considering Mr. Bennett\u2019s submissions and the record before this Court, I am of the view that his appeal must fail. While Mr. Bennett may not agree with the outcome of the status review hearing and of his appeal before the Federal Court, he has not identified any reviewable error in the case management judge\u2019s decision to dismiss his action, or in the Federal Court\u2019s decision not to intervene, that would justify this Court\u2019s intervention.\n[7] Considering the delay since the commencement of the action, Mr. Bennett\u2019s repeated failure to comply with the case management judge\u2019s orders and direction, his justifications for non-compliance, and his failure to put forward a concrete plan demonstrating that he would move the matter forward with diligence, it was open to the case management judge, in the exercise of her discretion on status review, to dismiss Mr. Bennett\u2019s action. While courts generally show flexibility with self-represented litigants, lack of counsel or familiarity with the rules of procedure and the law does not exempt claimants from moving their action forward. I am satisfied that the Federal Court properly declined to interfere with the case management judge\u2019s decision as it did not amount to an improper exercise of discretion.\n[8] Moreover, Mr. Bennett has failed to convince me that his allegations of bias and breaches of procedural fairness are well founded. In this regard, one of Mr. Bennett\u2019s arguments relates to a statement in the show-cause order where the case management judge noted that the \u201cCourt Registry has attempted to communicate with [Mr. Bennett] via telephone and email, with no response from [Mr. Bennett] having been received.\u201d Mr. Bennett disputes this information and claims that the case management judge based her decision on non-existing email and phone communications from the Registry between December 19, 2022, and January 5, 2023. Mr. Bennett has attempted to obtain access to these communications by bringing several motions before this Court. In my view, Mr. Bennett\u2019s claim is without consequence as there is no indication that the case management judge based her decision to dismiss his action on these email and telephone communications.\n[9] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal without costs. Although the Minister requested costs on this appeal and on Mr. Bennett\u2019s various motions, I would exercise my discretion not to award costs pursuant to Rules 400(1) and 400(3) of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR\/98-106, given Mr. Bennett\u2019s circumstances.\n\"Sylvie E.

L-2 (le Code) contre le Syndicat des employ\u00e9es et employ\u00e9s nationaux\/Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (le Syndicat) au motif que la demanderesse n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve suffisante \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue d\u2019un manquement au devoir juste de repr\u00e9sentation de la part du Syndicat.\n[3] Dans sa plainte, la demanderesse all\u00e8gue que le Syndicat a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son devoir de repr\u00e9sentation juste, en vertu de l\u2019article 37 du Code, puisque le Syndicat n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief individuel, libell\u00e9 comme la demanderesse le voulait, contestant la politique sur la vaccination contre la COVID-19 que son employeur a adopt\u00e9e. Son employeur, le Conseil des Arts du Canada (le CAC), a suivi la politique sur la vaccination contre la COVID-19 du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, qui s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 la plupart des fonctionnaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux.\n[4] La demanderesse voulait que le Syndicat conteste le bien-fond\u00e9 de ladite politique, croyant que les vaccins contre la COVID-19 \u00e9taient exp\u00e9rimentaux et possiblement dangereux et qu\u2019un employeur ne pouvait pas mettre ses employ\u00e9s \u00e0 pied sans solde s\u2019ils refusaient d\u2019\u00eatre vaccin\u00e9s contre la COVID-19. La demanderesse soutenait \u00e9galement que la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s interdisait l\u2019adoption d\u2019une telle politique par le CAC et voulait que le Syndicat fasse valoir cet argument. Elle recherchait en plus d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9dommag\u00e9e pour la p\u00e9riode de sa mise \u00e0 pied en raison de son choix de ne pas \u00eatre vaccin\u00e9e.\n[5] La demanderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 pied le 15 novembre 2021 en raison de son refus d\u2019\u00eatre vaccin\u00e9e contre la COVID-19, mais a seulement demand\u00e9 au Syndicat le 11 avril 2022 de d\u00e9poser un grief contestant la politique sur la vaccination contre la COVID-19 du CAC.\n[6] Lors des discussions par courriel entre la demanderesse et les repr\u00e9sentants du Syndicat, ces derniers ont avis\u00e9 la demanderesse que le Syndicat accepterait de d\u00e9poser un grief contestant sa mise au pied et ses pertes reli\u00e9es, mais n\u2019accepterait pas les amendements que la demanderesse voulait faire au projet de grief r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par le procureur du Syndicat. Le Syndicat a fourni \u00e0 la demanderesse des raisons pour ce refus. Un des repr\u00e9sentants du Syndicat a \u00e9galement avis\u00e9 la demanderesse que le Syndicat avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief de principe contre la politique de vaccination du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor le 22 mars 2022. De plus, un autre repr\u00e9sentant du Syndicat a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la demanderesse qu\u2019elle ne pouvait obtenir de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour la p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9lai pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un grief individuel sauf si elle pouvait \u00e9tablir qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait incapable de d\u00e9poser un grief plus t\u00f4t. Bien que la demanderesse ait pr\u00e9tendu souffrir d\u2019une telle incapacit\u00e9, elle n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve m\u00e9dicale au Syndicat, et le dossier devant le Conseil ne contentait que deux billets m\u00e9dicaux, autorisant l\u2019absence du travail de la demanderesse seulement jusqu\u2019en d\u00e9cembre 2021.\n[7] Dans son m\u00e9moire et devant la Cour, la demanderesse reproche au Conseil d\u2019avoir commis des erreurs de fait et de droit et de ne pas avoir respect\u00e9 les principes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle soutient que :\nle Conseil a affirm\u00e9 sans preuve que le Syndicat lui a expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi le Syndicat acceptait la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 des vaccins;\nle Conseil n\u2019a pas suivi les crit\u00e8res applicables pour d\u00e9terminer si le Syndicat a agi de mani\u00e8re arbitraire, discriminatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi dans la repr\u00e9sentation d\u2019un employ\u00e9;\nle Conseil n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 les crit\u00e8res indiqu\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c.

Ce dernier argument met en cause le fait que le Conseil a choisi de ne pas tenir une audience pour examiner les arguments contenus dans la pi\u00e8ce P-4.\n[8] La d\u00e9cision du Conseil de rejeter la plainte de la demanderesse doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable : Vavilov au para. 83; Watson c.

Comme le Conseil a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la page 13 de sa d\u00e9cision en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00ab le Conseil doit \u2026 se concentrer sur la conduite du syndicat, \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il a fait une enqu\u00eate et s\u2019il a s\u00e9rieusement r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi aux faits et arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le plaignant \u00bb.\n[10] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le Conseil a d\u00e9taill\u00e9 la preuve pertinente et a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la demanderesse n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de preuve suffisante \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue pour soutenir sa plainte. En arrivant \u00e0 sa conclusion, le Conseil a suivi ses d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures semblables, soit Watson c. Canadian Union of Public Employees, 2022 CCRI 1002 et Stevenson c. Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, 2022 CCRI 1020. Le Conseil a ajout\u00e9 que notre Cour a maintenu la d\u00e9cision du Conseil dans l\u2019affaire Watson.\n[11] Le Conseil pouvait raisonnablement rejeter la plainte de la demanderesse puisque la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e d\u00e9montrait que le Syndicat avait examin\u00e9 les arguments de la demanderesse et lui avait expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi le Syndicat ne d\u00e9poserait pas le grief que la demanderesse voulait poursuivre. En outre, il \u00e9tait loisible au Conseil de conclure que le Syndicat avait fourni des explications suffisantes \u00e0 la demanderesse. Contrairement \u00e0 ce que la demanderesse soutient, le Conseil a suivi la jurisprudence, a appliqu\u00e9 les crit\u00e8res pertinents pour d\u00e9terminer si le Syndicat avait agi de mani\u00e8re arbitraire, discriminatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi dans la repr\u00e9sentation d\u2019un employ\u00e9, et est arriv\u00e9 aux conclusions factuelles soutenues par la preuve. De plus, le Conseil a fourni des motifs d\u00e9taill\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa d\u00e9cision. Ainsi, la d\u00e9cision du Conseil est raisonnable.\n[12] Les arguments de la demanderesse par rapport aux manquements \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale sont \u00e9galement sans fondement.\n[13] Le Conseil n\u2019est pas tenu de tenir une audience chaque fois qu\u2019on lui en fait la demande. L\u2019article 16.1 du Code pr\u00e9voit que le Conseil peut trancher toute affaire ou question dont il est saisi sans tenir d\u2019audience. La Cour a souvent reconnu le pouvoir du Conseil de trancher des dossiers sans tenir d\u2019audience : Paris c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de Transports R.M.T. (Unifor-Qu\u00e9bec), 2022 CAF 173 au para. 6; Watson aux paras. 50-52 (et les d\u00e9cisions qui sont cit\u00e9es dans lesdits paragraphes).\n[14] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la version amend\u00e9e de la pi\u00e8ce P-4, le Conseil a refus\u00e9 de verser ce document au dossier parce que le document a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on tardive, apr\u00e8s que le dossier soit en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 devant un banc du Conseil. Il \u00e9tait loisible au Conseil de refuser le d\u00e9p\u00f4t vu l\u2019article 10 du R\u00e8glement 2012 sur le conseil canadien des relations industrielles, DORS\/2001-520, qui pr\u00e9voit que toute demande au Conseil doit comporter, entre autres, un expos\u00e9 d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des faits et moyens invoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui d\u2019une demande.\n[15] De plus, la pi\u00e8ce P-4 amend\u00e9e ajoutait que des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 la jurisprudence. Seulement une des d\u00e9cisions ajout\u00e9es dans la version amend\u00e9e de la pi\u00e8ce P-4 \u00e9tait pertinente \u00e0 la plainte de la demanderesse, soit la d\u00e9cision du Conseil dans McRaeJackson, 2004 CCRI 290. Cependant, cette d\u00e9cision ne fait que r\u00e9sumer la jurisprudence du Conseil en mati\u00e8re de l\u2019article 37 du Code, qui est bien connue et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fid\u00e8lement suivie par le Conseil dans la d\u00e9cision en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Donc, la pi\u00e8ce P-4 n\u2019aurait rien apport\u00e9 au dossier de toute fa\u00e7on.\n[16] Durant l\u2019audience devant notre Cour, la demanderesse soul\u00e8ve un nouvel argument qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 dans son m\u00e9moire, soit que la d\u00e9cision du CAC aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre contest\u00e9e par le Syndicat puisque la politique sur la vaccination contre la COVID-19 du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor ne s\u2019appliquait pas au CAC. Mais, la demanderesse n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 cet argument devant le Conseil ni au Syndicat. Elle ne peut pas le faire valoir en contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour, car notre r\u00f4le n\u2019est que de statuer sur le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la d\u00e9cision du Conseil et de d\u00e9terminer si la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tait \u00e9quitable eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des circonstances: McMaster c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CAF 37 au para. 4; Andrews c. Alliance de la fonction publique, 2022 CAF 159 aux paras. 17-24; Kalonji c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CAF 8 au para. 7.\n[17] Je rejetterais donc la pr\u00e9sente demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Vu que le Syndicat ne recherche pas des d\u00e9pens, je n\u2019en accorderais pas.\n\u00ab Mary J.L. Gleason \u00bb\nj.c.a.\n\u00ab Je suis d\u2019accord.\nGeorge R.

Ce jugement (le Jugement), r\u00e9pertori\u00e9 \u00e0 2021 CF 164, accueillait la demande de r\u00e9vision log\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant\/intim\u00e9 incident (l\u2019Appelant) aux termes du paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, L.R.C. 1985, c. A -1 (la Loi) \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du refus de l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l\u2019Agence) de lui communiquer l\u2019enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 des renseignements faisant l\u2019objet de la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information qu\u2019il avait formul\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s d\u2019elle.\n[2] Ce refus \u00e9tait essentiellement fond\u00e9 sur le paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi, lequel oblige le responsable de l\u2019institution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale vis\u00e9 par une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information de \u00ab refuser la communication de documents contenant des renseignements personnels \u00bb. Les renseignements ainsi pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s en vertu du paragraphe 19(1) en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont les images de voyageurs et d\u2019agents de l\u2019Agence capt\u00e9es par des cam\u00e9ras de surveillance install\u00e9es par l\u2019Agence \u00e0 un des points d\u2019entr\u00e9e de la fronti\u00e8re canado-am\u00e9ricaine o\u00f9 travaillait l\u2019Appelant. Seules les images des agents sont en cause ici.\n[3] L\u2019Appelant, qui se repr\u00e9sente seul devant cette Cour, se pourvoit \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du Jugement, m\u00eame si celui-ci lui parait favorable. Il soutient, en effet, que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne s\u2019est pas prononc\u00e9e sur tous les moyens qu\u2019il a soulev\u00e9s devant elle et qu\u2019elle a fait d\u00e9faut, par cons\u00e9quent, d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019Agence de divulguer l\u2019ensemble des renseignements vis\u00e9s par sa demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, et non juste une partie de ceux-ci, comme elle a fait. Pour sa part, l\u2019intim\u00e9\/appelant incident (l\u2019Intim\u00e9) reproche \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019avoir incorrectement limit\u00e9 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019exemption pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 19 de la Loi. Il lui reproche \u00e9galement la d\u00e9marche qu\u2019elle a suivie pour r\u00e9soudre cette question.\n[4] Pour les motifs qui suivent, j\u2019estime que l\u2019appel principal doit \u00e9chouer. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019appel incident, je propose qu\u2019il soit accueilli.\nI. Le contexte [5] Le 3 juillet 2017, l\u2019Appelant est impliqu\u00e9 dans un incident avec l\u2019un de ses sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la fin de son quart de travail. Il \u0153uvre \u00e0 ce moment au poste-fronti\u00e8re du pont Queenston, dans le sud de l\u2019Ontario. Suite \u00e0 cet incident, l\u2019Agence lance une enqu\u00eate interne; l\u2019Appelant, lui, d\u00e9pose un grief.\n[6] Le 31 juillet 2017, l\u2019Appelant, en marge de cette enqu\u00eate et de ce grief, produit aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019Agence une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information. Cette demande (no. A-2017-12202) est libell\u00e9e comme suit :\nLieu : Zone des comptoirs de bus de la section voyageurs du pont Queenston au 14154 Niagara Parkway, Niagara-on-the-lake, ON, L0S 1J0. Je demande que me soient remis l\u2019ensemble des documents suivants : L\u2019ensemble des rapports r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par les employ\u00e9s et les gestionnaires pr\u00e9sents aux comptoirs primaires des bus en avec les all\u00e9gations faites par [\u2026] le 2017-07-03 entre 23:00 et 00:00. Je r\u00e9clame que me soient remis TOUS les rapports de tous les agents ayant eu \u00e0 r\u00e9diger quoi que ce soit par rapport \u00e0 cela. Je r\u00e9clame que me soient [sic] communiqu\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble des copies conformes des enregistrements des vid\u00e9os de surveillance dans la zone de comptoirs de bus entre 23:30 et 0:06 au cours de cette journ\u00e9e. Notamment celles me montrant interagir avec la surintendante [\u2026], le surintendant [\u2026] et l\u2019ensemble des interactions nous impliquant les uns les autres entre 23 :45 et 00 :06. Je r\u00e9clame \u00e9galement que me soient communiqu\u00e9s des enregistrements de toutes les vid\u00e9os de surveillance situ\u00e9es au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e, entre 23 :30 et 00 :06. Je tiens \u00e0 voir les vas et viens des employ\u00e9s quittant et arrivant sur les lieux de travail au cours de cette p\u00e9riode.\n[7] L\u2019Agence r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la demande le 21 f\u00e9vrier 2018 en communiquant \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant les rapports \u00e9crits vis\u00e9s par ladite demande de m\u00eame qu\u2019un total de sept (7) bandes vid\u00e9os, certaines caviard\u00e9es, d\u2019autres non. Insatisfait de la r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019Appelant porte plainte aupr\u00e8s du Commissaire \u00e0 l\u2019information du Canada. Il se plaint principalement du fait que la totalit\u00e9 des bandes vid\u00e9os demand\u00e9es ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e et que celles qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 volontairement alt\u00e9r\u00e9es au montage en plus d\u2019\u00eatre presque impossibles \u00e0 visionner, \u00e9tant en mode acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[8] Le 14 d\u00e9cembre 2018, le Commissaire rejette la plainte, mais indique avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Agence de refaire les bandes vid\u00e9os transmises le 21 f\u00e9vrier 2018 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 corriger le probl\u00e8me technique not\u00e9 par l\u2019Appelant. L\u2019Agence s\u2019ex\u00e9cute le 19 octobre 2018 lorsqu\u2019elle transmet \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant une version corrig\u00e9e des bandes vid\u00e9os en question. Le Commissaire note par ailleurs que si toutes les bandes vid\u00e9os qui ont pu exister au jour et aux heures vis\u00e9s par la demande n\u2019ont pas toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant, c\u2019est parce que certaines ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9es en vertu de la politique de conservation des enregistrements de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l\u2019Agence, laquelle pr\u00e9voit une p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9tention de 30 jours. Seules les bandes vid\u00e9os jug\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires aux fins de l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne entreprise suite \u00e0 l\u2019incident du 3 juillet 2017 sont conserv\u00e9es. Ce sont les sept (7) bandes vid\u00e9os transmises \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant. Le Commissaire note aussi, \u00e0 ce dernier \u00e9gard, que les pr\u00e9l\u00e8vements effectu\u00e9s par l\u2019Agence sur certaines de ces bandes vid\u00e9os sont conformes au \u00ab cadre clair \u00bb r\u00e9gissant le droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e dans le contexte de l\u2019utilisation de cam\u00e9ras de surveillance en milieu de travail.\n[9] Suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception du rapport du Commissaire \u00e0 l\u2019information, l\u2019Appelant exerce le recours en r\u00e9vision pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi. Aux termes de ce recours, l\u2019Appelant, qui est alors repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par avocat, demande \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale :\na) de d\u00e9clarer que l\u2019Agence ne peut pas s\u2019appuyer sur le paragraphe 19(1) de la [Loi] pour refuser de communiquer certains enregistrements des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019Agence, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ces enregistrements contiennent des renseignements vis\u00e9s par le paragraphe 3(j) de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, RSC 1985, c P-21; et ainsi\nb) d\u2019infirmer les d\u00e9cisions dat\u00e9es du 21 f\u00e9vrier 2018 et du 19 octobre 2018; et\nc) d\u2019ordonner au ministre de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et de la Protection civile [\u2026] de r\u00e9pondre int\u00e9gralement \u00e0 la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information no A-2017-12202;\nd) le tout avec d\u00e9pens.\n(Avis de demande, Dossier d\u2019appel amend\u00e9 \u00e0 la p. 817)\nII.

(4th) 1 (Canada (GRC)), juge que les images pr\u00e9lev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce en vertu du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi tombent sous l\u2019exception \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3(j) de la LPRP, en tant que renseignements portant sur le poste et les fonctions des agents concern\u00e9s.\n[12] Selon elle, si, comme la Cour supr\u00eame l\u2019a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Dagg, les feuilles de pr\u00e9sence d\u2019employ\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9raux \u2014 dans cette affaire, des employ\u00e9s du minist\u00e8re des Finances \u2014 tombent sous l\u2019exception de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP en tant que renseignements concernant la nature d\u2019un poste donn\u00e9, il est difficile \u00ab d\u2019imaginer comment l\u2019image d\u2019un agent des services frontaliers, capt\u00e9e alors qu\u2019il est en uniforme et en fonction pour son employeur, pourrait \u00eatre exclue de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP \u00bb (Jugement au para. 34). Lire cette exception comme le fait l\u2019Agence serait, poursuit-elle, limiter ind\u00fbment la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de sa disposition liminaire.\n[13] Ayant conclu que les images pr\u00e9lev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale se dit d\u2019avis qu\u2019il ne lui est pas n\u00e9cessaire, dans ce contexte, de trancher le d\u00e9bat entourant l\u2019application faite par l\u2019Agence de l\u2019article 25 de la Loi. Cette disposition l\u00e9gislative impose aux institutions f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, lorsqu\u2019elles sont d\u2019avis, vu la nature des renseignements contenus dans un document vis\u00e9 par une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, que la communication de celui-ci peut \u00eatre refus\u00e9e, l\u2019obligation de n\u00e9anmoins communiquer les parties du document d\u00e9pourvues des renseignements en cause lorsque cela \u00ab ne pose pas de probl\u00e8mes s\u00e9rieux \u00bb.\nIII. Questions en litige et norme de contr\u00f4le [14] \u00c0 mon sens, la pr\u00e9sente affaire soul\u00e8ve les questions suivantes :\na) La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a-t-elle omis de se prononcer sur l\u2019ensemble des questions soulev\u00e9es dans le recours que l\u2019Appelant a entrepris devant elle et d\u2019ainsi accorder \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant la r\u00e9paration qu\u2019il recherchait, soit une ordonnance obligeant l\u2019Agence \u00e0 lui divulguer tous les renseignements vis\u00e9s par sa demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information ?\nb) Dans la n\u00e9gative, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a-t-elle commis une erreur justifiant l\u2019intervention de cette Cour en concluant que le recours \u00e0 l\u2019exemption \u00e9tablie au paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ?\nc) Si c\u2019est le cas, y a-t-il lieu de se prononcer sur l\u2019application qu\u2019a faite l\u2019Agence de l\u2019article 25 de la Loi et, s\u2019il y a lieu de le faire, l\u2019application qu\u2019elle en a faite \u00e9tait-elle conforme aux exigences de cette disposition ?\n[15] S\u2019il y a eu, \u00e0 un certain moment, un d\u00e9bat au sein de cette Cour sur la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable \u00e0 l\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aux termes de l\u2019article 41 de la Loi, ce d\u00e9bat a pris fin en juin 2019, par l\u2019ajout, \u00e0 la Loi, de l\u2019article 44.1, lequel \u00e9nonce que les recours entrepris en vertu de l\u2019article 41, notamment, doivent \u00eatre \u00ab entendus et jug\u00e9s comme une nouvelle affaire \u00bb.\n[16] L\u2019ajout de cette disposition fait donc maintenant en sorte que la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable aux appels des d\u00e9cisions rendues aux termes de l\u2019article 41 de la Loi est celle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235 (Housen), et non celle, pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Agraira c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et protection civile), 2013 CSC 36, [2013] 2 R.C.S. 559, applicable aux appels des d\u00e9cisions rendues par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le judiciaire (Canada (Sant\u00e9) c. Elanco Canada Limited, 2021 CAF 191, 337 A.C.W.S. (3d) 153 au para. 32 (Elanco)).\n[17] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que la norme de contr\u00f4le \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Housen requiert que la Cour r\u00e9vise les questions de droit se posant devant elle suivant la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte et qu\u2019elle n\u2019intervienne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions de fait ou mixtes de fait et de droit que si elle constate la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une erreur manifeste et dominante (Housen aux para. 26\u201128; Elanco au para. 33).\nIV. Analyse A. L\u2019appel principal [18] L\u2019Appelant, je le rappelle, soutient que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aurait omis de traiter de l\u2019ensemble des questions soulev\u00e9es dans le recours qu\u2019il a entrepris devant elle, un recours qu\u2019elle devait pourtant juger, pr\u00e9cise-t-il, comme une affaire nouvelle, ce qui, selon lui, l\u2019obligeait \u00e0 se prononcer sur l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de sa demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et \u00e0 ordonner, en cas de succ\u00e8s, la divulgation compl\u00e8te des renseignements qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019Agence.\n[19] Outre le fait que d\u2019aucuns pourraient pr\u00e9tendre que ce type de r\u00e9crimination constitue davantage un motif ouvrant droit \u00e0 une demande de reconsid\u00e9ration aux termes de la r\u00e8gle 397(1)(b) des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, DORS\/98-106, que d\u2019un motif d\u2019appel, cet argument, quoi qu\u2019il en soit, ne r\u00e9siste pas \u00e0 l\u2019analyse, et ce, pour deux raisons. Premi\u00e8rement, une lecture de l\u2019Avis de demande et du m\u00e9moire des faits et du droit produits par l\u2019Appelant devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u00e9montre clairement que l\u2019Appelant a ultimement cibl\u00e9 son recours sur l\u2019utilisation faite de l\u2019article 19 de la Loi en lien avec quatre (4) des sept (7) bandes vid\u00e9os qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, soit celles identifi\u00e9es au paragraphe 28 dudit m\u00e9moire et au paragraphe 16 du Jugement :\na) Traffic_Bus_Passenger_Pil_2017-07-14-1714;\nb) Traffic_Bus_Passenger_Secondary_1_2017-07-14_1700;\nc) Traffic_Bus_Passenger_Secondary_2_2017-07-14_1707;\nd) Traffic_Corr_Outside_1131_2017-07-18_1426.\n[20] C\u2019est donc de cette fa\u00e7on que l\u2019Appelant a formul\u00e9 et circonscrit son recours devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et on ne peut reprocher \u00e0 celle-ci une quelconque omission en rapport avec ce qu\u2019elle avait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider. L\u2019Appelant met l\u2019emphase sur la conclusion de son Avis de demande aux termes de laquelle il requiert qu\u2019il soit ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Intim\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00ab int\u00e9gralement \u00bb \u00e0 sa demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information (Avis de demande, Dossier d\u2019appel amend\u00e9 \u00e0 la p. 46). Or, cette conclusion g\u00e9n\u00e9rique ne peut \u00eatre dissoci\u00e9e du reste de l\u2019Avis de demande et de la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019Appelant a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 sa position dans son m\u00e9moire. En d\u2019autres termes, elle ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un fourre-tout autorisant la prise en compte, devant cette Cour, de moyens n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Je note, du reste, qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune preuve au dossier d\u00e9montrant que l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment par l\u2019avocate qui repr\u00e9sentait l\u2019Appelant lors de l\u2019audience devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[21] Comme l\u2019Intim\u00e9 le souligne \u00e0 juste titre, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, cette Cour ne se penchera pas sur une question qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e en premi\u00e8re instance (Oleynik c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2020 CAF 5, 441 D.L.R. (4th) 744 au para. 72). Or, rien ne justifie, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, une quelconque d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle.\n[22] Cela m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 mon deuxi\u00e8me point. Devant cette Cour, l\u2019Appelant, qui, je le rappelle, se repr\u00e9sente dor\u00e9navant seul, a tent\u00e9 \u00e0 plus d\u2019une reprise d\u2019\u00e9largir le d\u00e9bat en demandant, en outre, la permission de pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en appel de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 cette Cour de r\u00e9pondre \u00ab \u00e0 toutes les questions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es et auxquelles la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas pu r\u00e9pondre du fait des subterfuges [de l\u2019Intim\u00e9] \u00bb. Pour faire sanctionner ces \u00ab subterfuges \u00bb, l\u2019Appelant a m\u00eame pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en outrage au tribunal contre l\u2019affiant principal de l\u2019Intim\u00e9.\n[23] Toutes ces demandes ont \u00e9chou\u00e9. Cette Cour doit donc d\u00e9cider du pr\u00e9sent appel \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du dossier tel que constitu\u00e9 devant elle. Or, ce dossier n\u2019autorise pas l\u2019Appelant \u00e0 \u00e9largir la port\u00e9e du d\u00e9bat comme il souhaiterait le faire ou encore \u00e0 traiter de questions qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[24] L\u2019appel principal m\u2019apparait donc d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de tout fondement. Par cons\u00e9quent, je le rejetterais.\nB. L\u2019appel incident [25] L\u2019appel incident fait intervenir la seconde question en litige, qui est celle de savoir si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a err\u00e9 en concluant que les renseignements dont l\u2019Agence refuse la divulgation ne tombent pas sous l\u2019exemption du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi au motif qu\u2019ils seraient eux-m\u00eames vis\u00e9s par une des exceptions au concept de \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb, tel que d\u00e9fini par la LPRP.\n[26] Cette question met en cause la port\u00e9e du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi et, par ricochet, celle de la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb que l\u2019on retrouve \u00e0 la LPRP et \u00e0 laquelle la Loi renvoie.\n[27] S\u2019agissant d\u2019abord d\u2019une question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation statutaire, le traitement qu\u2019en a fait la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale doit \u00eatre r\u00e9vis\u00e9 selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte (Housen au para. 8) et la question elle-m\u00eame, analys\u00e9e suivant la m\u00e9thode moderne d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois, laquelle requiert que le texte des dispositions en cause soit examin\u00e9 \u00ab dans leur contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s\u2019harmonise avec l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la loi, l\u2019objet de la loi et l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 R.C.S. 27, 154 D.L.R. (4th) 193 au para. 21, citant Elmer A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes, 2e \u00e9d., Toronto, Butterworths, 1983 \u00e0 la p. 87; Bayer Cropscience LP c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CAF 77, 155 C.P.R. (4th) 99 au para. 67, citant Tran c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2017 CSC 50, [2017] 2 R.C.S. 289, au para. 23).\n[28] Du m\u00eame souffle, il nous faudra voir o\u00f9 se situe, par rapport \u00e0 cet exercice, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation retenue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Cette interpr\u00e9tation, qui, je le rappelle, prend essentiellement appui sur la lecture que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a faite des arr\u00eats Dagg et Canada (GRC), peut se r\u00e9sumer comme suit :\na) La Loi, qui vise \u00e0 promouvoir la transparence des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00c9tat, et la LPRP sont des lois compl\u00e9mentaires; elles doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es harmonieusement et aucune n\u2019a pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur l\u2019autre;\nb) Bien que la disposition liminaire de la d\u00e9finition que donne la LPRP du concept de \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb soit tr\u00e8s large, elle est assujettie \u00e0 des exceptions qui, bien qu\u2019elles ne devraient pas limiter la port\u00e9e de ladite d\u00e9finition, s\u2019appliquent, notamment, au contexte du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi;\nc) Il ne fait aucun doute qu\u2019en l\u2019absence de ces exceptions, et en particulier de celle qui concerne l\u2019information portant sur le poste ou les fonctions d\u2019un cadre ou employ\u00e9, actuel ou ancien, d\u2019une institution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, les renseignements en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u2014 les images de coll\u00e8gues de l\u2019appelant apparaissant sur les bandes vid\u00e9os litigieuses \u2014 sont des renseignements personnels prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi;\nd) Or, cette exception, pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP, est applicable aux renseignements en cause puisqu\u2019il est difficile d\u2019imaginer que l\u2019image d\u2019un agent des services frontaliers, capt\u00e9e alors qu\u2019il est en uniforme et en fonction, ne constitue pas, au m\u00eame titre que ses feuilles de pr\u00e9sence au travail, un renseignement portant sur la nature des attributions de son poste; on peut dire, \u00e0 ce titre, qu\u2019il y a presque une ad\u00e9quation entre la pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019agent sur les lieux du travail et l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions;\ne) L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par l\u2019Agence, qui repose sur des analogies faites avec certains des exemples de renseignements personnels que l\u2019on retrouve \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de ce concept \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la LPRP, a pour effet de limiter la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019exception en cause, une approche \u2014 \u00ab circulaire \u00bb \u2014 pourtant rejet\u00e9e dans Canada (GRC).\n[29] Il est utile, \u00e0 ce stade, de reproduire les portions pertinentes du texte des dispositions en cause, l\u2019enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 du texte \u00e9tant reproduite en annexe aux pr\u00e9sents motifs :\nLoi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, L.R.C. 1985, c.

supr\u00eame nous renseigne d\u00e9j\u00e0 sur le contexte global, l\u2019esprit et l\u2019objet des deux lois en cause, de m\u00eame que sur le sens et la port\u00e9e du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi en particulier. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en r\u00e9sume correctement les grands traits, particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu\u2019elle souligne la port\u00e9e ind\u00e9niablement large de la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb et le fait que les exceptions \u00e0 cette d\u00e9finition ne devraient pas en limiter la port\u00e9e, du moins, j\u2019ajouterais, au-del\u00e0 de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire.\n[31] Une lecture attentive de cette jurisprudence fait toutefois apparaitre une autre dimension importante du rapport entre la Loi et la LPRP, dimension qui ne transparait pas du Jugement, ce qui explique peut-\u00eatre la port\u00e9e qu\u2019a donn\u00e9e la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP et, de ce fait, \u00e0 l\u2019exemption imp\u00e9rative du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi.\n[32] En effet, bien qu\u2019elles soient compl\u00e9mentaires, comme l\u2019a correctement not\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et qu\u2019elles doivent \u00eatre \u00ab interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es conjointement \u00bb, comme l\u2019a rappel\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019affaire Cie H.J. Heinz du Canada Lt\u00e9e c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2006 CSC 13, [2006] 1 R.C.S. 441 (Heinz), qui mettait aussi en cause la port\u00e9e du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi (Heinz aux para. 2, 12; voir \u00e9galement Dagg au para. 1), il est acquis que la Loi et la LPRP, lues ensemble, \u00ab accordent une plus grande protection aux renseignements personnels \u00bb (Heinz aux para. 29\u201331; voir \u00e9galement : Dagg au para. 48, juge La Forest, dissident quant au r\u00e9sultat). Cela fait en sorte qu\u2019il faut se garder de \u00ab donner une \"interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9troite\" \u00e0 l\u2019exception des renseignements personnels en conf\u00e9rant \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information primaut\u00e9 sur la protection des renseignements personnels \u00bb (Heinz au para. 61, citant Dagg au para. 51, juge La Forest, dissident quant au r\u00e9sultat).\n[33] Il est important de rappeler que le r\u00e9gime mis en place par la Loi et la LPRP vise \u00e0 concilier deux principes oppos\u00e9s que sont l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, d\u2019une part, et la protection des renseignements personnels, d\u2019autre part (Dagg au para. 45, juge La Forest, dissident quant au r\u00e9sultat; voir \u00e9galement Dagg au para. 1 et Canada (GRC) au para. 21, souscrivant dans les deux cas aux motifs du juge La Forest, dissident quant au r\u00e9sultat, sur la fa\u00e7on d\u2019aborder l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Loi et de la LPRP). Ce r\u00e9gime, qui tente d\u2019\u00e9tablir et maintenir un \u00ab fragile \u00e9quilibre \u00bb entre ces deux principes, favorise toutefois, \u00ab syst\u00e9matiquement \u00bb, dans la mesure qui y est pr\u00e9vue, la protection des renseignements personnels (Heinz aux para. 1, 24). Les droits pr\u00e9vus aux deux lois n\u2019ont donc pas, en tout temps, valeur \u00e9gale et lorsqu\u2019il est question des renseignements personnels d\u2019un individu, le droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e l\u2019emporte sur le droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, sauf dans la mesure pr\u00e9vue par la loi (Heinz au para. 26).\n[34] Cette nuance, je le rappelle, ne semble pas faire partie des jalons sur lesquels le raisonnement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est construit. \u00c0 tout le moins, il n\u2019en est pas fait mention. Comme on vient de le constater, ce r\u00e9gime fait clairement primer la protection des renseignements personnels sur le droit \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information. Il requiert, \u00e0 cette fin, de la part des tribunaux, une approche calibr\u00e9e tendant \u00e0 favoriser une \u00ab protection efficace \u00bb de ces renseignements, ce qui doit notamment inciter ceux-ci \u00e0 \u00ab ne pas cr\u00e9er d\u2019obstacles artificiels \u00bb \u00e0 cette protection (Heinz au para. 31).\n[35] Il ne suffit donc pas, pour souligner l\u2019importance de la protection des renseignements personnels dans le cadre de ce r\u00e9gime, de faire \u00e9tat du caract\u00e8re ind\u00e9niablement tr\u00e8s large de la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb; il faut \u00e9galement articuler l\u2019analyse en fonction de la primaut\u00e9 de cette protection sur le droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information. Cela va aussi pour l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 suivant lequel aucune des deux lois en cause n\u2019a pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur l\u2019autre puisqu\u2019en raison de cette primaut\u00e9, le droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information n\u2019a pas, en tout temps, valeur \u00e9gale \u00e0 la protection des renseignements personnels.\n[36] Ayant trac\u00e9 les principes r\u00e9gissant l\u2019interaction entre la Loi et la LPRP, il y a lieu de s\u2019attaquer maintenant au rapport entre le paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi et l\u2019exception \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP.\n[37] S\u2019il est vrai que les fonctionnaires de l\u2019administration f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, en raison de la pr\u00e9sence de cette exception, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019un niveau de protection moindre de leur vie priv\u00e9e, lorsqu\u2019il est question de renseignements portant sur les poste et fonctions qu\u2019ils occupent (Canada (GRC) au para. 34), ils ne sont pas pour autant d\u00e9pourvus de toute protection.\n[38] Pour d\u00e9terminer ce niveau de protection, il faut se demander si les renseignements auxquels l\u2019acc\u00e8s est sollicit\u00e9, \u00ab portent directement sur les caract\u00e9ristiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales rattach\u00e9es au poste ou aux fonctions d\u2019un employ\u00e9 \u00bb et garder en t\u00eate qu\u2019ils \u00ab sont du genre de ceux qu\u2019on trouve dans la description de travail \u00bb, ce qui comprend \u00ab les conditions li\u00e9es au poste, dont les qualit\u00e9s requises, les attributions, les responsabilit\u00e9s, les heures de travail et l\u2019\u00e9chelle de traitement \u00bb (Canada (GRC) au para. 38, citant Dagg au para. 95, juge La Forest, dissident quant au r\u00e9sultat).\n[39] M\u00eame si sa port\u00e9e est \u00ab g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00bb et que la liste d\u2019exemples qu\u2019il comprend n\u2019est pas exhaustive, il reste que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP \u00ab a n\u00e9anmoins une port\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, car les renseignements doivent porter sur le poste ou les fonctions \u00bb et \u00ab ne doit s\u2019appliquer que lorsque les renseignements demand\u00e9s ont un lien suffisant avec les caract\u00e9ristiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales rattach\u00e9es au poste ou aux fonctions [\u2026] \u00bb (Canada (GRC) au para. 38).\n[40] L\u2019exception de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP demeure donc circonscrite par des balises relativement pr\u00e9cises. Par exemple, les renseignements qui touchent \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence et aux caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019un employ\u00e9, tout comme les \u00ab opinions exprim\u00e9es au sujet de la formation, de la personnalit\u00e9 [et] de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience \u00bb de cet employ\u00e9, ne sont pas vis\u00e9s par cette exception (Canada (GRC) au para. 38) . Dans l\u2019affaire Dagg, si les juges majoritaires ont jug\u00e9 que les renseignements contenus \u00e0 une feuille de pr\u00e9sence tombaient sous cette exception, ils n\u2019ont pas manqu\u00e9 de souligner qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait-l\u00e0 de \u00ab renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9riques sur le poste lui-m\u00eame \u00bb (Dagg au para. 12).\n[41] Il en va de m\u00eame de l\u2019\u00e9chelle salariale associ\u00e9e au poste occup\u00e9 par un employ\u00e9, qui tombe sous l\u2019exception de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP, mais non le salaire de l\u2019employ\u00e9, un renseignement qui lui est propre (Dagg au para. 13), bien qu\u2019il soit intimement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019emploi qu\u2019il occupe.\n[42] Ici, la tension est vive entre les \u00ab deux principes oppos\u00e9s \u00bb puisque, comme l\u2019a correctement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait de l\u2019exception de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP, les renseignements en cause se qualifieraient sans \u00e9quivoque au titre de \u00ab renseignements personnels \u00bb, au sens de la LPRP. On n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 lire la d\u00e9finition de ce concept, reproduite au paragraphe 29 des pr\u00e9sents motifs, pour s\u2019en convaincre.\n[43] L\u00e0 o\u00f9 le b\u00e2t blesse en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, c\u2019est que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a tent\u00e9 de concilier ces deux principes en assimilant \u00ab les renseignements contenus dans une bande vid\u00e9o capt\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e et au d\u00e9part d\u2019un employ\u00e9 \u00bb, qu\u2019elle a par ailleurs reconnus, comme je viens de le mentionner, comme \u00e9tant autrement des renseignements personnels au sens de la LPRP, \u00e0 ceux \u00ab contenus dans [l]es feuilles de pr\u00e9sence \u00bb de l\u2019employ\u00e9. Selon elle, citant l\u2019arr\u00eat Dagg, dans les deux cas, ces renseignements bien qu\u2019ils \u00ab ne r\u00e9v\u00e8lent rien au sujet de la nature des attributions du poste \u00bb en donnent n\u00e9anmoins \u00ab une indication g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de leur \u00e9tendue \u00bb (Jugement au para. 35, citant Dagg au para. 9). L\u2019Appelant fait \u00e9cho au Jugement, sans plus.\n[44] En tout respect, cette ad\u00e9quation est probl\u00e9matique puisqu\u2019elle fait fi de l\u2019ensemble des renseignements propres \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 que peuvent r\u00e9v\u00e9ler les images capt\u00e9es sur les lieux du travail. En d\u2019autres termes, contrairement aux feuilles de pr\u00e9sence, qui n\u2019ont qu\u2019un caract\u00e8re informationnel g\u00e9n\u00e9rique sur le poste occup\u00e9 par l\u2019employ\u00e9 et les fonctions associ\u00e9es \u00e0 ce poste, les images capt\u00e9es sur les lieux du travail en r\u00e9v\u00e8lent, en principe, bien davantage sur l\u2019employ\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame et les \u00ab caract\u00e9ristiques \u00bb qui lui sont propres, et ce, m\u00eame s\u2019il porte un uniforme.\n[45] Il est en effet \u00e0 se demander, comme le requiert la grille d\u2019analyse applicable \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP, dont, du reste, il n\u2019ait pas fait mention dans le Jugement, en quoi les traits physiques ou personnels de l\u2019employ\u00e9 que peuvent r\u00e9v\u00e9ler les images capt\u00e9es par des cam\u00e9ras de surveillance install\u00e9es sur les lieux de travail, comme la couleur de la peau, les traits du visage, la stature, le handicap, l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 un groupe religieux ou autre groupe, le langage corporel et m\u00eame les mani\u00e9rismes observables, portent directement sur les caract\u00e9ristiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales rattach\u00e9es au poste ou fonctions de cet employ\u00e9 et r\u00e9v\u00e8lent des renseignements qui sont du m\u00eame type que ceux que l\u2019on trouve dans une description de travail.\n[46] Je ne vois, bien humblement, aucun rapport entre les deux, et ce, m\u00eame si les images sont capt\u00e9es sur les lieux du travail puisque, au-del\u00e0 de pouvoir visionner l\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00ab en action \u00bb, ces images sont susceptibles de d\u00e9voiler des renseignements qui sont propres \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 et qui sont li\u00e9s davantage \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont il exerce ses fonctions et, ultimement, \u00e0 sa comp\u00e9tence, et \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont il affiche sa personnalit\u00e9, son identit\u00e9 ou ses croyances sur son lieu du travail, ce qui n\u2019est pas couvert par cette exception.\n[47] Sur ce plan, comme nous l\u2019avons vu, la protection de la LPRP continue d\u2019\u00eatre assur\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9raux (Canada (GRC) au para. 38) et le fait de devoir porter un uniforme n\u2019y change rien. Pouss\u00e9e \u00e0 sa limite, cette caract\u00e9ristique \u2014 le fait de porter un uniforme \u2014 cr\u00e9erait deux cat\u00e9gories de fonctionnaires au sein du r\u00e9gime \u00e9tabli par la Loi et la LPRP : ceux qui portent l\u2019uniforme, et qui sont priv\u00e9s de la protection du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi, et ceux qui n\u2019en portent pas et qui, par cons\u00e9quent, continuent de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de cette protection. Cela ne peut avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0 l\u2019intention du Parlement.\n[48] En somme, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, au nom de la transparence des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00c9tat, a fait primer le droit \u00e0 l\u2019information sur celui \u00e0 la protection des renseignements personnels. Elle a, ce faisant, donn\u00e9 une port\u00e9e beaucoup trop large \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP, r\u00e9duisant du m\u00eame coup celle du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi. Ce r\u00e9sultat, \u00e0 mon sens, est, comme on l\u2019a vu, non conforme au droit applicable et d\u00e9coule ainsi d\u2019une erreur justifiant l\u2019intervention de la Cour. En d\u2019autres termes, il lui fallait faire primer le droit \u00e0 la protection des renseignements personnels puisqu\u2019il n\u2019existait pas de lien suffisant entre l\u2019ensemble des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par les images des agents et les caract\u00e9ristiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales rattach\u00e9es \u00e0 leurs postes ou fonctions.\n[49] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, la procureure de l\u2019Intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que l\u2019Agence avait commis une erreur en divulguant l\u2019image des agents qui apparaissent sur les bandes vid\u00e9os sur lesquelles on peut voir aussi l\u2019Appelant. Selon elle, l\u2019image de tous les agents apparaissant sur les bandes vid\u00e9os en cause aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e sans \u00e9gard au fait qu\u2019on y voit l\u2019Appelant ou pas.\n[50] Je suis d\u2019accord puisque rien dans la Loi ou la LPRP ne justifie une telle distinction. En d\u2019autres termes, tous les agents apparaissant sur les bandes vid\u00e9os avaient droit \u00e0 la m\u00eame protection aux termes du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi. En ce sens, il fallait leur appliquer l\u2019exception de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019objet ou \u00e0 la nature de la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information de l\u2019Appelant (Canada (GRC) au para. 32).\n[51] Finalement, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 reproche \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019avoir abord\u00e9 incorrectement l\u2019analyse qu\u2019un recours en vertu de l\u2019article 41 de la Loi lui imposait. L\u2019Intim\u00e9 plaide essentiellement que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale devait proc\u00e9der \u00e0 sa propre analyse, et non, axer celle-ci sur la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019Agence et sur ce qui la motivait.\n[52] Compte tenu de la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j\u2019en suis arriv\u00e9 sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019exception de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3j) de la LPRP et, par-del\u00e0, de l\u2019exemption pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, selon moi, d\u2019aborder en d\u00e9tail le second volet de l\u2019appel incident. Il suffit de dire que si certains de ses passages, comme la formulation de la question en litige portant sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi (Jugement au para. 17A), peuvent porter \u00e0 confusion \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, le Jugement, lu dans son ensemble, laisse voir que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait sa propre analyse de la question qu\u2019elle avait \u00e0 trancher, et ce, ind\u00e9pendamment de la position de l\u2019Agence, m\u00eame si elle a critiqu\u00e9 celle-ci \u00e0 certains moments.\n[53] Ayant conclu que l\u2019Agence pouvait, \u00e0 bon droit, recourir au paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi pour refuser la divulgation des images des agents apparaissant sur les bandes vid\u00e9os communiqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant, les questions touchant l\u2019article 25 de la Loi doivent \u00eatre abord\u00e9es.\nC. L\u2019article 25 de la Loi [54] L\u2019article 25 de la Loi oblige le responsable d\u2019une institution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 communiquer les parties du document faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information qui sont d\u00e9pourvues des renseignements dont ce responsable est en droit de refuser la divulgation, \u00e0 condition que le pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement de ces parties ne pose pas de probl\u00e8mes s\u00e9rieux (Merck Frosst Canada Lt\u00e9e. c. Canada (Sant\u00e9), [2012] 1 R.C.S. 23, 342 D.L.R. (4th) 257 au para. 229 (Merck)).\n[55] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la preuve au dossier, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019en dit l\u2019Appelant, r\u00e9v\u00e8le que cet exercice \u2014 obligatoire \u2014 a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait (Merck au para. 236). En effet, les documents en cause \u2014 soit les bandes vid\u00e9os litigieuses \u2014 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant apr\u00e8s qu\u2019aient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s les renseignements que l\u2019Agence estimait \u00eatre des renseignements personnels prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le paragraphe 19(1) de la Loi, m\u00eame si, elle a erron\u00e9ment fait exception. Il ne fait donc aucun doute que l\u2019Agence a trait\u00e9 la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information de l\u2019Appelant en ayant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit le devoir que lui imposait l\u2019article 25 de la Loi.\n[56] La question \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre est donc celle de savoir si l\u2019Agence s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9e de ce devoir selon les exigences de l\u2019article 25. Tel que mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de trancher cette question puisqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que les bandes vid\u00e9os en litige devaient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019Appelant dans leur enti\u00e8ret\u00e9, \u00e0 la seule exception des images du public voyageur.\n[57] Dans ces circonstances, je dois en premier lieu d\u00e9cider si cette d\u00e9termination doit \u00eatre laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, auquel cas il faudrait que le dossier lui soit retourn\u00e9, ou s\u2019il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que cette Cour d\u00e9cide de la question au lieu et place de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, comme lui permet de le faire le sous alin\u00e9a 52b)(i) de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. 1985, c. F-7, lequel autorise la Cour, lorsqu\u2019elle est saisie de l\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00e0 \u00ab rendre le jugement que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb rendre et prendre toutes mesures d\u2019ex\u00e9cution ou autres que celle-ci aurait d\u00fb prendre \u00bb.\n[58] D\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, il est important de mentionner que jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant ce pouvoir a \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9 avec parcimonie, car il ne revient normalement pas \u00e0 cette Cour d\u2019agir comme tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance. Cette r\u00e9ticence vient \u00ab non seulement de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience et de l\u2019expertise accrues de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re de recherche des faits, mais aussi des complications pratiques et autres li\u00e9es \u00e0 la recherche des faits par une formation de trois juges \u00bb (Sandhu Singh Hamdard Trust c. Navsun Holdings Ltd, 2019 CAF 295, 169 C.P.R. (4th) 325 au para. 59; voir aussi : Canada (Revenu national) c. Hydro Qu\u00e9bec, 2023 CAF 171 aux para. 27\u201329).\n[59] L\u2019Intim\u00e9 nous exhorte cependant \u00e0 exercer ce pouvoir. Il estime qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice de le faire puisque (i) la preuve n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de la conformit\u00e9 des pr\u00e9l\u00e8vements effectu\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce aux exigences de l\u2019article 25 est d\u00e9j\u00e0 au dossier, (ii) celui-ci, dans sa forme judiciaris\u00e9e, perdure depuis 2019 et engendre de l\u2019incertitude au sein de l\u2019appareil f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sur la fa\u00e7on de traiter les demandes d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information portant sur l\u2019image des employ\u00e9s, et (iii) la r\u00e9solution compl\u00e8te du pr\u00e9sent appel r\u00e9pondrait aux objectifs de r\u00e9solution rapide, efficace et \u00e9conomique devant guider l\u2019exercice des recours entrepris devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[60] Il y aura bient\u00f4t sept (7) ans que l\u2019Appelant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et, comme le souligne l\u2019Intim\u00e9, toute la preuve n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 ce qu\u2019aurait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider cette Cour au lieu et place de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est au dossier. Au surplus, cette preuve n\u2019a rien de controvers\u00e9e si bien que cette Cour est dans une aussi bonne position que le serait la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour d\u00e9cider de cette question. \u00c9galement, le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi incident soul\u00e8ve une question importante et il est, \u00e0 mon avis, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice que la Cour utilise le pouvoir qui lui est d\u00e9volu aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(b)i) de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales afin que cette question soit r\u00e9solue sans plus de d\u00e9lai.\n[61] La Cour doit donc d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019Agence a appliqu\u00e9 correctement l\u2019article 25 (Merck au para. 232) et doit le faire, tel que le pr\u00e9voit le nouvel article 44.1 de la Loi, comme si elle \u00e9tait saisie d\u2019une \u00ab nouvelle affaire \u00bb. \u00c0 cette fin, elle ne doit \u00e0 l\u2019Agence aucune d\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\n[62] Il s\u2019agit ici de se demander si, parmi les images vid\u00e9os soustraites \u00e0 la divulgation, se trouvent des renseignements qui auraient n\u00e9anmoins d\u00fb \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s par l\u2019Agence. Suivant l\u2019article 25 de la Loi, une telle communication s\u2019impose si cela ne pose pas \u00ab de probl\u00e8mes s\u00e9rieux \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019institution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale concern\u00e9e. Ce sera le cas (i) si les renseignements en cause, une fois communiqu\u00e9s, ont un sens sur le plan s\u00e9mantique, rendant ainsi la communication \u00ab utile \u00bb, et (ii) si les avantages li\u00e9s \u00e0 leur pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement et \u00e0 leur divulgation \u00ab justifient les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par l\u2019institution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en vue d\u2019expurger le document en cause \u00bb (Merck au para. 237). En d\u2019autres termes, l\u2019analyse des co\u00fbts et avantages justifiera la divulgation de ces renseignements si le travail de pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement n\u00e9cessaire est raisonnablement proportionn\u00e9 \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019acc\u00e8s qui s\u2019ensuivrait (Merck au para. 237, citant Bande indienne de Montana c. Canada (Ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), [1989] 1 C.F. 143, 51 D.L.R. (4th) 306).\n[63] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il faut appliquer ce test \u00e0 des images vid\u00e9os, et non \u00e0 des documents, comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas dans l\u2019affaire Merck, et il faut le faire en gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit \u00ab l\u2019objet de l\u2019art. 25, qui vise \u00e0 faciliter l\u2019acc\u00e8s au plus de renseignements possible tout en donnant effet aux exceptions pr\u00e9cises et limit\u00e9es pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 la Loi \u00bb (Merck au para. 238, citant Ontario (S\u00fbret\u00e9 et S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique), 2010 CSC 23, [2010] 1 R.C.S. 815 au para. 67).\n[64] Sur trois (3) des quatre (4) bandes vid\u00e9os en cause, les pr\u00e9l\u00e8vements sont significatifs et visent les membres du public voyageur pr\u00e9sents sur les lieux capt\u00e9s par les cam\u00e9ras de surveillance, de m\u00eame que les agents pr\u00e9sents lorsque l\u2019Appelant n\u2019apparait pas sur les images. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019utilit\u00e9 de ce qui pourrait \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9, il est \u00e0 se demander ce qu\u2019il en serait d\u2019un ensemble disparate d\u2019images vid\u00e9os de lieux physiques (parties de murs, plafonds, corridors, bureaux, etc.) ou encore, pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 la limite, d\u2019images purg\u00e9es des traits physiques ou personnels des agents concern\u00e9s, tels la couleur de la peau, les traits du visage, la stature, le handicap, l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 un groupe religieux ou autre groupe, le langage corporel et les mani\u00e9rismes observables.\n[65] Au niveau des co\u00fbts et des avantages \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une telle extraction de renseignements par ailleurs divulgables, la preuve indique que contrairement \u00e0 des documents, ce type d\u2019exercice, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019images vid\u00e9os, pr\u00e9sente des d\u00e9fis particuliers dans la mesure o\u00f9 chaque seconde d\u2019enregistrement vid\u00e9o contient une soixantaine d\u2019images. L\u2019Intim\u00e9 soutient donc qu\u2019isoler, par exemple, le contenu personnel identifiable de chaque image repr\u00e9sente un d\u00e9fi colossal.\n[66] Je fais miens ici les propos de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Attaran c. Canada (D\u00e9fense nationale), 2011 CF 664, 391 F.T.R. 70 (Attaran), selon lesquels \u00ab l\u2019application de l\u2019article 25 de la [Loi] dans le contexte de la suppression de renseignements personnels sur une photographie [\u2026] devrait favoriser la protection du droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e de la personne vis\u00e9e \u00bb (Attaran au para. 29) (soulignement dans l\u2019original). Cet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 a tout autant son importance, selon moi, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019appliquer l\u2019article 25 de la Loi \u00e0 des identificateurs personnels apparaissant sur des images vid\u00e9os.\n[67] Sans dire qu\u2019en toutes circonstances, ce type d\u2019extraction, quand il s\u2019agit d\u2019images vid\u00e9os, est inutile et n\u2019est pas raisonnablement proportionn\u00e9 \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019acc\u00e8s qui s\u2019ensuit, je suis d\u2019avis, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du dossier qui est devant la Cour, que tel est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019article 25 a \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information produite par l\u2019Appelant et l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 en conformit\u00e9 avec son objet. Cet objet, je le rappelle, est de faciliter l\u2019acc\u00e8s dans la meilleure mesure possible tout en donnant effet aux exemptions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 la Loi, dont celle portant sur la protection des renseignements personnels, laquelle est imp\u00e9rative et prime sur le droit \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information.\n[68] Si les pr\u00e9l\u00e8vements effectu\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce peuvent para\u00eetre importants, quantitativement, je rappelle qu\u2019aux termes du paragraphe 19(2) de la Loi, la communication de renseignements personnels s\u2019impose lorsque (i) l\u2019individu qu\u2019ils concernent y consent; (ii) le public y a acc\u00e8s ou (iii) la communication est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019article 8 de la LPRP, lequel \u00e9num\u00e8re un certain nombre de situations o\u00f9 la communication de tels renseignements est permise. Toutefois, l\u2019application du paragraphe 19(2) de la Loi aux circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire d\u00e9borde du cadre de cet appel.\nV. Conclusion [69] Pour toutes ces raisons, je rejetterais l\u2019appel principal, avec d\u00e9pens, et j\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel incident. J\u2019infirmerais ainsi le Jugement et rendant la d\u00e9cision que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb rendre, je rejetterais le recours entrepris par l\u2019Appelant aux termes de l\u2019article 41 de la Loi et je le ferais avec d\u00e9pens en faveur de l\u2019Intim\u00e9 tant devant cette Cour que devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n\u00ab Ren\u00e9 LeBlanc \u00bb\nj.c.a.\n\u00ab Je suis d\u2019accord.\nRichard Boivin j.c.a. \u00bb\n\u00ab Je suis d\u2019accord.\nNathalie Goyette j.c.a. \u00bb\nANNEXE\nLoi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, L.R.C. 1985, c.

Consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019elles constituent de la publicit\u00e9, le ministre du Patrimoine canadien a refus\u00e9 de d\u00e9livrer le certificat ouvrant droit au cr\u00e9dit pour chacune des productions. Les productrices ont chacune pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de ce refus \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Cette derni\u00e8re a accueilli les demandes des productrices, annul\u00e9 les avis de refus et retourn\u00e9 les dossiers au ministre pour nouvelle d\u00e9termination : 9616934 Canada Inc. c. Canada (Patrimoine), 2023 CF 432.\n[2] En appel, le ministre demande \u00e0 cette Cour d\u2019infirmer la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et de rejeter les demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Par voie d\u2019appel incident, les productrices demandent \u00e0 cette Cour de d\u00e9clarer ultra vires des pouvoirs du ministre et, par cons\u00e9quent, nulles et sans effet les d\u00e9finitions de \u00ab publicit\u00e9 \u00bb pr\u00e9vues aux lignes directrices sur la base desquelles la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise.\n[3] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s, j\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel du ministre et rejetterais l\u2019appel incident. M\u00eame si un aspect des lignes directrices pose probl\u00e8me, la d\u00e9cision du ministre est n\u00e9anmoins raisonnable, et il n\u2019y a pas lieu de d\u00e9clarer ultra vires les d\u00e9finitions de \u00ab publicit\u00e9 \u00bb pr\u00e9vues aux lignes directrices.\nI. Contexte A. Contexte l\u00e9gislatif et r\u00e8glementaire [4] Sauf indication contraire, les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives cit\u00e9es r\u00e9f\u00e8rent \u00e0 la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C. 1985, c. 1 (5e suppl) [Loi].\n[5] Le cr\u00e9dit dont il est ici question procure aux productions admissibles un cr\u00e9dit d'imp\u00f4t pleinement remboursable, correspondant \u00e0 25% de la d\u00e9pense de main-d'\u0153uvre admissible : paragraphe 125.4(3). Pour \u00eatre admissible, une production doit \u00eatre accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019un \u00ab certificat de production cin\u00e9matographique ou magn\u00e9toscopique canadienne \u00bb d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par le ministre : paragraphes 125.4(1), (3); paragraphe 1106(4) du R\u00e8glement de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, C.R.C., c. 945 [R\u00e8glement]. Pour qu\u2019il d\u00e9livre le certificat, le ministre doit consid\u00e9rer que la production satisfait aux exigences pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 1106(4) du R\u00e8glement, notamment l\u2019exigence de ne pas constituer une \u00ab production exclue \u00bb au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1106(1)b) du R\u00e8glement, soit une production qui est, selon le cas :\n(i) une \u00e9mission d\u2019information, d\u2019actualit\u00e9s ou d\u2019affaires publiques ou une \u00e9mission qui comprend des bulletins sur la m\u00e9t\u00e9o ou les march\u00e9s boursiers,\n(ii) [Abrog\u00e9, DORS\/2016-262, art. 1]\n(iii) une production comportant un jeu, un questionnaire ou un concours, sauf celle qui s\u2019adresse principalement aux personnes mineures,\n(iv) la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une activit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un \u00e9v\u00e9nement sportif,\n(v) la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019un gala ou d\u2019une remise de prix,\n(vi) une production visant \u00e0 lever des fonds,\n(vii) de la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision v\u00e9rit\u00e9,\n(viii) de la pornographie,\n(ix) de la publicit\u00e9,\n(x) une production produite principalement \u00e0 des fins industrielles ou institutionnelles,\n(xi) une production, sauf un documentaire, qui consiste en totalit\u00e9 ou en presque totalit\u00e9 en m\u00e9trage d\u2019archives. (excluded production) [Je souligne]\n[6] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le ministre consid\u00e8re que les productions en cause constituent de la publicit\u00e9 au sens du sous-alin\u00e9a 1106(1)b)(ix) du R\u00e8glement. Ni la Loi, ni le R\u00e8glement ne d\u00e9finissent le mot \u00ab publicit\u00e9 \u00bb. Pour conclure \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence de publicit\u00e9, le ministre s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9finition de ce mot qui se retrouve dans des lignes directrices qu\u2019il a publi\u00e9es en vertu du paragraphe 125.4(7). Ce paragraphe se lit ainsi :\n(7) Le ministre du Patrimoine canadien publie des lignes directrices sur les circonstances dans lesquelles les conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9finition de certificat de production cin\u00e9matographique ou magn\u00e9toscopique canadienne au paragraphe (1) sont remplies. Il est entendu que ces lignes directrices ne sont pas des textes r\u00e9glementaires au sens de la Loi sur les textes r\u00e9glementaires.\n[7] Deux versions de ces lignes directrices sont pertinentes pour les fins du pr\u00e9sent appel. Premi\u00e8rement, les lignes directrices du 2 avril 2012 pr\u00e9voient que la publicit\u00e9 est, entre autres, une production qui comprend \u00ab [l]es infopublicit\u00e9s, vid\u00e9os promotionnelles et d\u2019entreprise dont la dur\u00e9e exc\u00e8de 12 minutes et qui offrent du divertissement ou de l\u2019information combin\u00e9s \u00e0 la vente ou \u00e0 la promotion de biens ou de services dans un ensemble presque indiscernable \u00bb. Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019Avis public du 6 mars 2017 (lignes directrices de 2017) pr\u00e9voit une d\u00e9finition \u00ab r\u00e9vis\u00e9e \u00bb ou \u00ab nouvelle \u00bb selon laquelle la publicit\u00e9 est, entre autres, une production \u00ab dont plus de 15% de la dur\u00e9e consiste \u00e0 [\u2026] vanter les m\u00e9rites d\u2019un ou de plusieurs produits, services, \u00e9v\u00e9nements, organisations ou entreprises, et\/ou [\u2026] afficher des logos ou d\u2019autres images de marque \u00bb.\n[8] Avant d\u2019examiner le contexte factuel, il importe de souligner que, bien qu\u2019il incombe au ministre d\u2019\u00e9mettre le certificat et, par le fait m\u00eame, de d\u00e9terminer si une production est admissible au cr\u00e9dit, cette d\u00e9termination s\u2019effectue sur la base de renseignements que lui fournit le producteur. Cette d\u00e9termination s\u2019effectue aussi sur la base de la recommandation du Bureau de certification des produits audiovisuels canadiens, une unit\u00e9 du minist\u00e8re du Patrimoine canadien sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans la mise en \u0153uvre de cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t comme celui en cause : Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Zone 3-XXXVI Inc., 2016 CAF 242 au para. 6 [Zone 3].\nB. Contexte factuel [9] En juin 2016, donc avant la publication des lignes directrices de 2017, les productrices pr\u00e9sentent une demande de certification \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de deux productions : Croisi\u00e8res de r\u00eave 4 et Soleil tout inclus 8. Apr\u00e8s la publication des lignes directrices de 2017, en avril 2017, elles pr\u00e9sentent une demande de certification de la troisi\u00e8me production : Soleil tout inclus 9.\n[10] En d\u00e9cembre 2017, le Bureau de certification des produits audiovisuels canadiens transmet aux productrices des pr\u00e9avis de refus de certification \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des productions Soleil tout inclus 8 et Soleil tout inclus 9. Dans les pr\u00e9avis, le Bureau fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux dispositions l\u00e9gislatives et r\u00e8glementaires pertinentes et aux lignes directrices de 2017. Le Bureau fait aussi r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux lignes directrices de 2012 parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de celles \u00ab qui \u00e9taient disponibles \u00bb au moment o\u00f9 les productrices ont entrepris la production de Soleil tout inclus 8 et 9. De l\u2019avis du Bureau, les productions sont de la publicit\u00e9 au sens des lignes directrices de 2017, car plus que 15% de leur dur\u00e9e consiste \u00e0 vanter les complexes h\u00f4teliers et destinations touristiques qui sont les sujets des productions. Les productions sont aussi de la publicit\u00e9 au sens des lignes directrices de 2012 parce que ces productions \u00ab offre[nt] du divertissement ou de l\u2019information combin\u00e9s \u00e0 la vente ou \u00e0 la promotion de biens ou de services dans un ensemble presque indiscernable \u00bb. Le Bureau souligne que le ministre ne peut \u00e9mettre de certificat aux productions qui ne r\u00e9pondent pas aux exigences de la Loi et du R\u00e8glement. Enfin, le Bureau invite les productrices \u00e0 soumettre tout nouveau renseignement qui pourrait influer sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation de leurs dossiers.\n[11] En juin 2018, le Bureau transmet un pr\u00e9avis de refus de certification \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la production Croisi\u00e8res de r\u00eave 4. Le pr\u00e9avis reprend les \u00e9l\u00e9ments sur lesquels se fondent les pr\u00e9avis des productions Soleil tout inclus 8 et 9. Le Bureau ajoute un \u00e9l\u00e9ment non discut\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment : la d\u00e9cision alors r\u00e9cente de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale Serdy Vid\u00e9o II Inc. c. Canada (Patrimoine), 2018 CF 413 [Serdy]. Selon le Bureau, Serdy valide l\u2019approche du Bureau qui consiste \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer comme de la publicit\u00e9 les \u00ab images vid\u00e9o combin\u00e9es \u00e0 de la narration descriptive tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9e et \u00e9logieuse, accompagn\u00e9e de d\u00e9tails quant aux services inclus \u00bb.\n[12] En r\u00e9ponse aux pr\u00e9avis, les productrices soumettent des repr\u00e9sentations faisant valoir que, dans le pass\u00e9, le ministre a accord\u00e9 le cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 des productions dont le contenu publicitaire d\u00e9passait le seuil de 15%. Les productrices font aussi valoir que la situation dans Serdy diff\u00e8re de la leur en ce que les productions examin\u00e9es dans Serdy avaient un contenu publicitaire d\u00e9passant 50% de leur dur\u00e9e. Enfin, les productrices plaident que l\u2019objectif des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives et r\u00e8glementaires pertinentes est d\u2019\u00e9viter que le cr\u00e9dit soit accord\u00e9 \u00e0 une production dont les co\u00fbts sont enti\u00e8rement pay\u00e9s par un commanditaire ou par le fournisseur des produits ou services dont traite la production. Ce n\u2019est pas le cas des productions en cause puisque les productrices sont des producteurs ind\u00e9pendants.\n[13] Consid\u00e9rant que les repr\u00e9sentations des productrices n\u2019\u00e9tayent pas la conclusion selon laquelle leurs productions ne constituent pas de la publicit\u00e9, le Bureau recommande au ministre de refuser de certifier les productions en cause. C\u2019est ce que le ministre fait par lettres dat\u00e9es du 21 d\u00e9cembre 2018. Le ministre explique que sa d\u00e9cision repose sur les repr\u00e9sentations des productrices ainsi que sur l\u2019analyse et la recommandation du Bureau. Le ministre indique qu\u2019\u00e0 son avis, les productions en cause offrent \u00ab du divertissement ou de l\u2019information combin\u00e9s \u00e0 la vente ou \u00e0 la promotion de biens et de services dans un ensemble presque indiscernable \u00bb. Il ajoute que bien au-del\u00e0 de 15% de la dur\u00e9e des productions est constitu\u00e9e de logos et de segments vantant les services produits et services dont traitent les productions.\nII. Jugement de premi\u00e8re instance [14] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale conclut que la d\u00e9cision du ministre est d\u00e9raisonnable pour deux raisons.\n[15] Premi\u00e8rement, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale consid\u00e8re que le seuil de 15% n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des faits et du droit qui contraignent la discr\u00e9tion du ministre. Il faut donner un sens aux mots qualifiant les productions exclues au paragraphe 1106(1) du R\u00e8glement. Par exemple, le sous-alin\u00e9a 1106(1)b)(iii) parle d\u2019une \u00ab production comportant un jeu \u00bb; le sous-alin\u00e9a (x) r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 une \u00ab production produite principalement \u00e0 des fins industrielles \u00bb; et le sous-alin\u00e9a (xi) parle d\u2019une production \u00ab qui consiste en totalit\u00e9 ou en presque totalit\u00e9 en m\u00e9trage d\u2019archives \u00bb. Ces qualificatifs sont d\u00e9terminants. Ainsi, dans la d\u00e9cision Zone 3, la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une \u00ab production comportant un jeu \u00bb a men\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019une production est exclue d\u00e8s qu\u2019elle comporte un aspect de jeu, m\u00eame si cet aspect n\u2019est pas important. \u00c0 l\u2019oppos\u00e9, en faisant simplement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 \u00ab de la publicit\u00e9 \u00bb, le sous-alin\u00e9a 1106(1)b)(ix) n\u2019utilise pas un adjectif ou un terme qui permettrait de consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019une seule partie d\u2019une production fasse de celle-ci de la publicit\u00e9. Dans ce contexte, le seuil de 15% n\u2019appartient pas aux issues possibles pouvant se justifier au regard du texte du R\u00e8glement.\n[16] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision du ministre manque de justification en ce sens que les motifs du ministre ne tiennent pas compte d\u2019une pr\u00e9occupation centrale soulev\u00e9e par les productrices : Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65 au para. 127 [Vavilov]. Tel que mentionn\u00e9, les productrices ont argument\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Bureau que l\u2019objectif l\u00e9gislatif et r\u00e8glementaire sous-tendant les genres de productions exclues au paragraphe 1106(1) du R\u00e8glement est d\u2019\u00e9viter que le cr\u00e9dit soit accord\u00e9 \u00e0 des productions dont les co\u00fbts sont enti\u00e8rement pay\u00e9s par le commanditaire ou fournisseur de services ou produits. Or, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale constate que ni les pr\u00e9avis de refus ni les lettres du ministre ne r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 cet argument. Selon la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, cette lacune rend la d\u00e9cision du ministre insuffisamment justifi\u00e9e et, par cons\u00e9quent, d\u00e9raisonnable.\nIII. Questions en litige [17] L\u2019appel soul\u00e8ve la question de la raisonnabilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision du ministre de refuser de certifier les productions des productrices. Comme il s\u2019agit d\u2019un appel d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire, notre Cour doit \u00ab se met[tre] \u00e0 la place \u00bb de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour r\u00e9viser la d\u00e9cision du ministre et d\u00e9cider si celle-ci est raisonnable : Agraira c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2013 CSC 36 au para. 46.\n[18] L\u2019appel incident, pour sa part, soul\u00e8ve la question de savoir si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb \u00e9mettre une d\u00e9claration selon laquelle les d\u00e9finitions de \u00ab publicit\u00e9 \u00bb, pr\u00e9vues aux lignes directrices de 2012 et 2017, sont ultra vires des pouvoirs du ministre.\nIV. Analyse A. L\u2019appel [19] Le ministre plaide que sa d\u00e9cision est raisonnable : elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux dispositions l\u00e9gislatives et r\u00e8glementaires pertinentes; le seuil de 15% sur lequel elle s\u2019appuie est conforme au sens commun du mot \u00ab publicit\u00e9 \u00bb; et elle s\u2019appuie sur d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments que le seuil de 15%. De plus, le ministre soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 tous les arguments soulev\u00e9s par les productrices.\n[20] Pour les raisons exprim\u00e9es ci-dessous, je suis d\u2019opinion que la d\u00e9cision du ministre est raisonnable.\n(1) Le ministre a aussi fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur les lignes directrices de 2012 [21] Une lecture globale et contextuelle des motifs du ministre r\u00e9v\u00e8le que celui-ci a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur les lignes directrices de 2012, pas seulement sur celles de 2017. En effet, tel que mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe [13] ci-dessus, les motifs du ministre indiquent que les productions en litige constituent de la publicit\u00e9 parce qu\u2019elles \u00ab offre[nt] du divertissement ou de l\u2019information combin\u00e9s \u00e0 la vente ou \u00e0 la promotion de biens ou de services dans un ensemble presque indiscernable \u00bb.\n[22] Les repr\u00e9sentations des productrices ne contiennent aucun argument qui me m\u00e8nerait \u00e0 conclure que cette d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9vue aux lignes directrices de 2012 n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des faits et du droit qui contraignent la discr\u00e9tion du ministre. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019avis que le recours \u00e0 cette d\u00e9finition de \u00ab publicit\u00e9 \u00bb par le ministre ne rend pas sa d\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable.\n(2) La justification de la d\u00e9cision [23] Selon les productrices, la d\u00e9cision du ministre est aussi d\u00e9raisonnable parce qu\u2019elle ne r\u00e9pond pas \u00e0 leur argument quant \u00e0 l\u2019objet sous-tendant le paragraphe 1106(1) du R\u00e8glement. Le ministre pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cet argument dans les lignes directrices de 2017. En effet, les paragraphes 8 \u00e0 11 des lignes directrices de 2017 portent sur la question de savoir si la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un niveau \u00e9lev\u00e9 de financement de la part d\u2019un annonceur ou commanditaire devrait mener \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019une production constitue de la publicit\u00e9. Les lignes directrices \u00e9noncent que, parce qu\u2019un financement ne se traduit pas n\u00e9cessairement par un contenu promotionnel explicite dans une production, ce crit\u00e8re du financement ne peut constituer un facteur d\u00e9terminant lorsqu\u2019on d\u00e9cide si une production est de la publicit\u00e9 ou non.\n[24] En tenant compte des paragraphes 8 \u00e0 11 des lignes directrices de 2017, je suis d\u2019avis que le ministre n\u2019a pas failli \u00e0 son obligation de justifier sa d\u00e9cision. Une cour de r\u00e9vision doit lire les motifs d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif de fa\u00e7on globale et contextuelle, eu \u00e9gard au dossier et en tenant d\u00fbment compte du r\u00e9gime administratif, ce qui inclut \u00ab les politiques ou lignes directrices accessibles au public \u00bb : Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2021 CAF 157 au para. 15 [Alexion] citant Vavilov aux para. 94, 97, 103, 122. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, une telle lecture m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la conclusion que le ministre s\u2019est attard\u00e9 \u00e0 cet argument principal.\nB. L\u2019appel incident [25] \u00c0 mon avis, bien qu\u2019il y ait un probl\u00e8me avec la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab publicit\u00e9 \u00bb pr\u00e9vue aux lignes directrices de 2017, il n\u2019y a pas lieu de d\u00e9clarer cette d\u00e9finition et celle des lignes directrices de 2012 comme \u00e9tant ultra vires des pouvoirs du ministre. Je m\u2019explique.\n(1) Le seuil de 15% n\u2019est pas raisonnable [26] Je consid\u00e8re que le seuil de 15% contenu dans la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab publicit\u00e9 \u00bb des lignes directrices de 2017 n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des faits et du droit qui contraignent la discr\u00e9tion du ministre. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je suis d\u2019accord avec les motifs exprim\u00e9s par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et j\u2019ajouterais les motifs suivants.\n[27] Je comprends que l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un seuil ou pourcentage puisse faciliter la t\u00e2che du ministre ainsi que celle des producteurs lorsqu\u2019il est question de d\u00e9terminer si une production est exclue ou non. Je suis aussi consciente qu\u2019en r\u00e9digeant les lignes directrices sur les circonstances qui satisfont aux conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9finition de certificat de production cin\u00e9matographique ou magn\u00e9toscopique canadienne au paragraphe 125.4(1), le ministre jouit d\u2019une discr\u00e9tion \u00e9tendue en vertu du paragraphe 125.4(7).\n[28] Cela dit, cette discr\u00e9tion n\u2019est pas infinie : Safe Food Matters Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2022 CAF 19 au para. 47. Comme notre Cour l\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, \u00ab un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire est toujours soumis aux limites impos\u00e9es par le sens v\u00e9ritable du texte l\u00e9gislatif qui le pr\u00e9voit et il doit toujours demeurer strictement dans ces limites \u00bb : Alexion au para. 40; voir aussi Jozipovic v. British Columbia (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board), 2012 BCCA 174 aux para. 91\u2013105. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le seuil de 15% outrepasse les limites de la discr\u00e9tion conf\u00e9r\u00e9e au ministre puisqu\u2019en faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une \u00ab production qui est [\u2026] de la publicit\u00e9 \u00bb (mon soulignement), le sous-alin\u00e9a 1106(1)b)(ix) du R\u00e8glement indique que la question de savoir si une production constitue \u00ab de la publicit\u00e9 \u00bb n\u2019en est pas une de pourcentage. Le contexte du sous-alin\u00e9a 1106(1)b)(ix) appuie cette conclusion. En effet, lorsque l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1106(1)b) du R\u00e8glement exclut une production sur la base d\u2019un pourcentage de son contenu, il utilise un langage qui fait appel \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019un pourcentage. C\u2019est le cas du qualificatif \u00ab en totalit\u00e9 ou presque \u00bb, qu\u2019on retrouve au sous-alin\u00e9a (xi), et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme signifiant plus de 90% : Weaver c. Canada, 2008 CAF 238 au para. 18 [Weaver]; Canada c. Adams (C.A.), 1998 CanLII 9058 (CAF), [1998] 3 CF 365 \u00e0 la p. 377. C\u2019est aussi le cas du qualificatif \u00ab principalement \u00bb, qu\u2019on retrouve aux sous-alin\u00e9as (iii) et (x), et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme signifiant plus de 50% : Burger King Restaurants of Canada Inc. c. Canada, 2000 CanLII 14854 (CAF), 2000 CarswellNat 4726 aux para. 9\u201321; Weaver au para. 18; Ville de Magog c. Canada, 2001 CAF 210 au para. 30. Par ailleurs, en faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 \u00ab de la publicit\u00e9 \u00bb sans aucun qualificatif, le sous-alin\u00e9a 1106(1)b)(ix) du R\u00e8glement indique qu\u2019il ne peut s\u2019agir d\u2019une production ayant un simple lien avec de la publicit\u00e9. Il en serait autrement si le qualificatif \u00ab comportant \u00bb (in respect of) avait \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 comme il l\u2019est au sous-alin\u00e9a (iii) : Zone 3 au para. 32; Nowegijick c. La Reine, [1983] 1 R.C.S. 29 \u00e0 la p. 39; Blanchard (E.J.) v. Canada, 1995 CanLII 18940 (FCA), [1995] 2 CTC 262 \u00e0 la p. 264. Dans ce contexte, le seuil de 15% m\u2019appara\u00eet trop faible pour faire partie des issues possibles pouvant se justifier au regard du texte du R\u00e8glement.\n[29] Bien que le ministre dispose, en vertu du paragraphe 125.4(7), d\u2019une certaine marge de man\u0153uvre pour ajuster son application du r\u00e9gime r\u00e8glementaire en cause \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9volution, par exemple, des pratiques de l\u2019industrie en mati\u00e8re de publicit\u00e9, cette marge de man\u0153uvre ne peut servir \u00e0 d\u00e9naturer les \u00ab productions exclues \u00bb pr\u00e9vues au R\u00e8glement.\n(2) Il n\u2019y a pas lieu de d\u00e9clarer les d\u00e9finitions ultra vires [30] Malgr\u00e9 le constat qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de concernant le seuil de 15%, je suis d\u2019avis que notre Cour ne devrait pas exercer sa discr\u00e9tion de d\u00e9clarer que la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab publicit\u00e9 \u00bb pr\u00e9vue aux lignes directrices de 2017 est ultra vires des pouvoirs du ministre : Shot Both Sides c. Canada, 2024 CSC 12 au para. 67. La Cour supr\u00eame enseigne qu\u2019un \u00ab jugement d\u00e9claratoire ne peut \u00eatre rendu que s\u2019il a une utilit\u00e9 pratique, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire s\u2019il r\u00e8gle un \u201clitige actuel\u201d entre les parties \u00bb : Daniels c. Canada (Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2016 CSC 12 au para. 11, citant Solosky c. La Reine, [1980] 1 R.C.S. 821; Borowski c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1989] 1 R.C.S. 342. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, une d\u00e9claration selon laquelle le seuil de 15% est ultra vires ne r\u00e8glera pas le litige actuel. En effet, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 ma conclusion ci-dessus selon laquelle la d\u00e9cision du ministre est raisonnable, le litige devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9solu en faveur du ministre, que notre Cour \u00e9mette une d\u00e9claration ou non.\n[31] Certes, une d\u00e9claration peut \u00eatre \u00e9mise lorsqu\u2019elle guiderait de futures d\u00e9cisions gouvernementales et qu\u2019aucun autre moyen appropri\u00e9 ne prot\u00e9gerait les droits en question : Ewert c. Canada, 2018 CSC 30 aux para. 83\u201384 ; Canada (Prime Minister) c. Khadr, 2010 CSC 3. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, m\u00eame en l\u2019absence d\u2019une d\u00e9claration, les d\u00e9cisions subs\u00e9quentes du ministre quant au cr\u00e9dit devront consid\u00e9rer la pr\u00e9sente affaire, notamment, la conclusion que le seuil de 15% est d\u00e9raisonnable. Si le ministre fonde une d\u00e9cision sur ce seuil de 15%, une cour de r\u00e9vision annulera simplement cette d\u00e9cision. Cons\u00e9quemment, une d\u00e9claration concernant le seuil de 15% n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour guider de futures d\u00e9cisions gouvernementales et, ainsi, n\u2019aurait aucune utilit\u00e9 pratique.\n[32] Enfin, en l\u2019absence d\u2019arguments menant \u00e0 la conclusion que la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab publicit\u00e9 \u00bb pr\u00e9vue aux lignes directrices de 2012 est d\u00e9raisonnable, il n\u2019y a pas lieu de d\u00e9clarer cette d\u00e9finition ultra vires des pouvoirs du ministre.\nV. Conclusion [33] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel du ministre, rejetterais l\u2019appel incident, infirmerais le jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rendu le 3 avril 2023 dans les dossiers T-148-19, T-149-19 et T-150-19, et rejetterais les demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire dans ces m\u00eames dossiers T-148-19, T-149-19 et T-150-19. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat somme toute partag\u00e9 concernant le bien-fond\u00e9 des arguments avanc\u00e9s par les parties, je n\u2019accorderais pas de d\u00e9pens devant cette Cour et mettrais de c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u2019adjudication des d\u00e9pens de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n\u00ab Nathalie Goyette \u00bb\nj.c.a.\n\u201cJe suis d\u2019accord.\nRen\u00e9 LeBlanc j.c.a.\u201d\n\u201cJe suis d\u2019accord.\nSylvie E.

Aux termes de son jugement, la Juge a confirm\u00e9 les avis de nouvelles cotisations \u00e9mis \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des appelants par l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019Agence) aux termes de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C., 1985 (5e suppl.), c.1 (la Loi), pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition se terminant au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2015 dans le cas de l\u2019appelante 1048547 Ontario Inc. (la Corporation) et pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2014 et 2015 pour les autres appelants, lesquels sont fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs et tous \u00e9troitement li\u00e9s aux op\u00e9rations de la Corporation, soit au titre d\u2019actionnaire, de haut-dirigeant et\/ou d\u2019employ\u00e9.\n[2] Les avis de nouvelles cotisations en cause ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis en lien avec certaines d\u00e9penses d\u2019entreprise refus\u00e9es \u00e0 la Corporation. Ces d\u00e9penses sont tr\u00e8s majoritairement des d\u00e9penses de voyage jug\u00e9es par l\u2019Agence, suite \u00e0 une v\u00e9rification des affaires de la Corporation entreprise aux termes de la Loi, \u00eatre des d\u00e9penses personnelles dont ont profit\u00e9 les autres appelants, et non des d\u00e9penses d\u2019entreprise dont la Corporation r\u00e9clamait la d\u00e9duction. Le montant de ces d\u00e9penses, une fois sa d\u00e9duction refus\u00e9e aux fins du calcul du revenu d\u2019entreprise net de la Corporation pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition se terminant le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2015, a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 au revenu des autres appelants, pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2014 et 2015, \u00e0 la hauteur du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice personnel qui, selon l\u2019Agence, en a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 pour chacun, \u00e0 titre d\u2019avantage imposable tant\u00f4t comme actionnaire de la Corporation, tant\u00f4t comme employ\u00e9 de celle-ci, tel que le permettent, respectivement, le paragraphe 15(1) et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1) a) de la Loi.\n[3] La Juge a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel log\u00e9 par les appelants \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ces avis de nouvelles cotisations principalement sur la base que les appelants n\u2019avaient pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 contrecarrer, m\u00eame sur une base prima facie, les hypoth\u00e8ses de faits sur lesquelles reposent lesdits avis. Elle a not\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard que les appelants n\u2019avaient offert aucune preuve documentaire \u00e0 cette fin et jug\u00e9 plus cr\u00e9dible et fiable le t\u00e9moignage de la v\u00e9rificatrice de l\u2019Agence ayant men\u00e9 la v\u00e9rification en cause. La Juge a notamment pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 ce t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 celui de la contr\u00f4leure de la Corporation, \u00e0 qui on avait confi\u00e9 le mandat de r\u00e9pondre aux questions que pouvait avoir la v\u00e9rificatrice et de lui fournir la documentation demand\u00e9e. Elle a jug\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de la contr\u00f4leure vague, non-convainquant et non cr\u00e9dible. Finalement, la Juge a tir\u00e9 une inf\u00e9rence n\u00e9gative du fait que, sans explications valables, trois des quatre autres appelants n\u2019ont pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s, que celui qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 a aussi offert un t\u00e9moignage vague, non-convainquant et non cr\u00e9dible et qu\u2019aucune preuve documentaire n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les appelants pour contrer, m\u00eame minimalement, les avis de nouvelles cotisations.\n[4] Devant nous, les appelants plaident que la Juge a manqu\u00e9 aux r\u00e8gles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale en refusant d\u2019ajourner le proc\u00e8s, compte tenu des d\u00e9lais serr\u00e9s avec lesquels leur nouveau procureur, venu en rel\u00e8ve \u00e0 leur ancien procureur \u00e0 la toute derni\u00e8re minute, a d\u00fb composer pour pr\u00e9parer l\u2019audience. Cette question requiert que nous nous demandions si \u00ab la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tait \u00e9quitable eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des circonstances \u00bb (Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique Limit\u00e9e c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CAF 69 au para. 54).\n[5] Les appelants soutiennent de plus que la Juge aurait err\u00e9 en validant la position de l\u2019Agence quant au caract\u00e8re personnel des d\u00e9penses en cause et, \u00e0 supposer qu\u2019elle ait eu raison, en validant l\u2019ajout d\u2019une partie de ces d\u00e9penses aux revenus des autres appelants sur la base, dans le cas de deux de ces quatre appelants, qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019avantages conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 un actionnaire et, dans le cas des deux autres, d\u2019avantages conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 un employ\u00e9. Ces questions doivent, pour leur part, \u00eatre examin\u00e9es suivant la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable aux appels d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019affaire Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33. Ainsi, les questions de droit \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre, s\u2019il en est, doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte alors les conclusions de fait ou mixtes de fait et de droit, doivent l\u2019\u00eatre suivant la norme d\u00e9f\u00e9rente de l\u2019erreur manifeste et dominante.\n[6] Or, nous sommes tous d\u2019avis que les arguments soulev\u00e9s par les appelants devant nous n\u2019ont aucun m\u00e9rite. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019argument d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, il suffit de dire que le procureur des appelants, qui s\u2019est par ailleurs dit pr\u00eat \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019ouverture du proc\u00e8s (Dossier d\u2019appel, vol. 3, p. 684-685), n\u2019a fait que proposer un ajournement sur la base qu\u2019il jugeait souhaitable que le proc\u00e8s, fix\u00e9 pour une journ\u00e9e 18 mois auparavant, se d\u00e9roule sur deux jours cons\u00e9cutifs (Dossier d\u2019appel, vol. 3, p. 693-697). Il \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait loisible \u00e0 la Juge de rejeter cette proposition, elle qui, du reste, a accept\u00e9 de prolonger le proc\u00e8s d\u2019une journ\u00e9e et de fixer la deuxi\u00e8me journ\u00e9e d\u2019audience une semaine apr\u00e8s la tenue de la premi\u00e8re, et ce de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 donner au procureur des appelants le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour examiner le cahier de pi\u00e8ces produit par l\u2019intim\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s et pour pr\u00e9parer le contre-interrogatoire de la v\u00e9rificatrice de l\u2019Agence, seule t\u00e9moin appel\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s. Il n\u2019y a eu, ici, aucune atteinte aux r\u00e8gles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, bien au contraire.\n[7] Quant aux trois autres reproches adress\u00e9s au jugement de la Juge, ils soul\u00e8vent des questions domin\u00e9es par les faits. Comme cette Cour a eu l\u2019occasion de l\u2019illustrer, la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et dominante, pour y satisfaire, requiert davantage que de simplement faire tomber les feuilles et les branches d\u2019un arbre; il faut \u00ab faire tomber l\u2019arbre tout entier \u00bb (Canada c. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 CAF 165 au para. 46). Cela traduit le caract\u00e8re exigeant de cette norme, laquelle, en retour, requiert un degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de retenue de notre part. Ce fardeau n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rencontr\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[8] D\u2019une part, il \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait loisible \u00e0 la Juge de maintenir les hypoth\u00e8ses de faits de l\u2019Agence quant au caract\u00e8re personnel des d\u00e9penses de voyage en cause. Les appelants semblent oublier qu\u2019aux termes du paragraphe 152(8) de la Loi, une cotisation (ou une nouvelle cotisation) est r\u00e9put\u00e9e valide et qu\u2019il appartient d\u00e8s lors au contribuable de \u00ab d\u00e9molir \u00bb ces hypoth\u00e8ses. Pour ce faire, il doit administrer une preuve rencontrant la norme civile de la balance des probabilit\u00e9s (Eisbrenner c. Canada, 2020 CAF 93, aux paras. 24-25; voir aussi Amiante Spec Inc. c Canada, 2009 CAF 139 au para. 23). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Juge a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que ce fardeau n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rencontr\u00e9, compte tenu du peu de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les appelants, laquelle, selon elle, \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 toutes fins utiles \u00e0 une absence de preuve. Cette conclusion, selon nous, est inattaquable. Il ne suffit pas de s\u2019en prendre \u00e0 la d\u00e9marche suivie par la v\u00e9rificatrice, comme le font les appelants, pour attaquer avec succ\u00e8s lesdites hypoth\u00e8ses. Comme l\u2019a correctement not\u00e9 la Juge, il est bien \u00e9tabli que la conduite du fonctionnaire du fisc, qui autorise l\u2019\u00e9tablissement, ici, d\u2019une nouvelle cotisation, n\u2019est pas pertinente pour d\u00e9cider de la validit\u00e9 ou du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de celle-ci (Ereiser c. Canada, 2013 CAF 20 au para. 31).\n[9] Bref, la Juge a soupes\u00e9 la preuve faite devant elle, not\u00e9 le peu de preuve administr\u00e9e par les appelants et, surtout, l\u2019absence totale de preuve documentaire qui viendrait \u00e9tayer les \u00e9nonc\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9raux des t\u00e9moins des appelants \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les d\u00e9penses en cause sont des d\u00e9penses encourues dans le but de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer un revenu d\u2019entreprise, et jug\u00e9 la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9 plus cr\u00e9dible, fiable et convaincante. Il n\u2019y a pas, ici, nous le r\u00e9p\u00e9tons, mati\u00e8re \u00e0 intervenir.\n[10] D\u2019autre part, le m\u00eame constat s\u2019impose quant aux deux derniers reproches. La preuve au dossier d\u00e9montre que les deux appelants que l\u2019Agence a jug\u00e9 avoir re\u00e7u un avantage imposable \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9s de la Corporation sont des employ\u00e9s de celle-ci (Dossier d\u2019appel, vol. 3, p. 933). Ces appelants plaident devant nous que l\u2019intim\u00e9 devait aussi faire la preuve qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient employ\u00e9s en 2014 et 2015 pour valider les avis de nouvelles cotisations \u00e9mis \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard. Or, les appelants se trompent puisque ce fardeau leur appartenait et qu\u2019ils ne s\u2019en sont pas d\u00e9charg\u00e9. Quant aux deux autres appelants, ils estiment qu\u2019en tant que d\u00e9tenteurs d\u2019actions privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es, ils ne pouvaient \u00eatre cotis\u00e9s comme actionnaires pour l\u2019avantage li\u00e9 aux d\u00e9penses personnelles qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 imput\u00e9es. Or, comme le note l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans son m\u00e9moire, le paragraphe 15(1) de la Loi ne fait pas de distinction entre actionnaires ordinaires et actionnaires privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s et ces appelants ne nous ont soumis aucune autorit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cet argument, tout comme ils n\u2019ont pas fait la preuve que les actions qu\u2019ils d\u00e9tenaient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque pertinente ne leur donnait pas droit au versement d\u2019un dividende au m\u00eame titre qu\u2019un actionnaire ordinaire.\n[11] Pour toutes les raisons qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le pr\u00e9sent appel sera rejet\u00e9. Quant aux d\u00e9pens ils feront l\u2019objet d\u2019une ordonnance s\u00e9par\u00e9e, suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception des pr\u00e9tentions \u00e9crites des parties sur cette question.\n\u00ab Ren\u00e9 LeBlanc \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\nA-93-23\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\n1048547 ONTARIO INC., KOSTANTINOS SKOTIDAKIS, JOHN SKOTIDAKIS, ANTIGONI SKOTIDAKIS, KOSTANTINA SKOTIDAKIS c.

La juge de la CCI a conclu que c\u2019est \u00e0 bon droit que le ministre du Revenu national a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les appelants cumulaient des heures d\u2019emploi assurable durant leurs p\u00e9riodes de cong\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 10.1(2) du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-emploi, DORS\/96-332 (R\u00e8glement).\n[2] La seule question qui doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e est celle de savoir si la juge de la CCI a commis une erreur en d\u00e9terminant que les conditions d\u2019application du paragraphe 10.1(2) du R\u00e8glement \u00e9taient remplies.\n[3] La norme de contr\u00f4le qui s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte pour les questions de droit. Pour ce qui est des questions mixtes de fait et de droit, notre Cour interviendra uniquement si l\u2019erreur est manifeste et dominante (Housen c. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235, 2002 CSC 33).\n[4] \u00c0 notre avis, cet appel ne peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[5] Lors de l\u2019audience, les appelants ont fait grand cas du fait que les sommes vers\u00e9es par le fiduciaire constituaient de l\u2019\u00e9pargne et non de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration assurable. Or, l\u00e0 n\u2019est pas la question et cet argument n\u2019est pas pertinent aux fins du pr\u00e9sent litige. En effet, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Lapointe rendue par notre cour (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Lapointe, 2013 CAF 52), l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de cong\u00e9 rev\u00eat le caract\u00e8re de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration assurable au moment o\u00f9 elle est pay\u00e9e, et ce, avant qu\u2019elle ne soit vers\u00e9e en fiducie. En fait, les appelants nous demandent d\u2019ignorer la d\u00e9cision Lapointe en vertu de laquelle nous sommes li\u00e9s. Aucun argument convaincant nous permettant de nous en \u00e9carter nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9.\n[6] Ainsi, en s\u2019appuyant sur la preuve au dossier et la jurisprudence pertinente comme elle l\u2019a fait, la juge de la CCI n\u2019a pas err\u00e9 dans les circonstances de cette affaire, en d\u00e9terminant que pour la p\u00e9riode en cause (18 ao\u00fbt 2016 au 5 ao\u00fbt 2017), les appelants cumulaient des heures d\u2019emploi assurable au cours de leurs p\u00e9riodes de cong\u00e9s pay\u00e9s, car les trois conditions au R\u00e8glement sont remplies: (i) les appelants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9tribu\u00e9s par leur employeur (ii) pour une p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9, et (iii) par un paiement forfaitaire d\u00e9termin\u00e9 sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode.\n[7] Nous ne d\u00e9celons aucune erreur qui justifierait notre intervention.\n[8] L\u2019appel sera donc rejet\u00e9 sans d\u00e9pens.\n\u00ab Richard Boivin \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIERS :\nA-181-22 ET A-182-22\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nYVAN BOUCHARD et YVES PROULX c.

Contexte [1] Le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada sollicite le contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u2019une d\u00e9cision (2022 CCRI 1051) rendue le 30 novembre 2022 par le Conseil canadien des relations industrielles conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 251.12 du Code canadien du travail, L.R.C. 1985, c. L-2 (Code). Aux termes de cette d\u00e9cision, le Conseil accueille en partie, pour cause de prescription, la demande de r\u00e9vision pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par monsieur Monette \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un ordre de paiement \u00e9mis le 16 mars 2021 par une inspectrice du Programme du travail d\u2019Emploi et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada.\n[2] Monsieur Monette est l\u2019un des deux anciens administrateurs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 D\u00e9m\u00e9nagement Montr\u00e9al Express Inc. Le 23 septembre 2015, l\u2019entreprise, qui est constitu\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s par actions, R.L.R.Q., c. S-31.1 (LSA) du Qu\u00e9bec, fait cession de ses biens sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur la faillite et l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9, L.R.C. 1985, c. B-3.\n[3] Le 2 octobre 2015, un ancien employ\u00e9 de l\u2019entreprise d\u00e9pose une plainte contre celle-ci pour cause de salaire impay\u00e9 et de non-versement de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de cong\u00e9 annuel. L\u2019inspectrice du Programme du travail entame par la suite une inspection afin de v\u00e9rifier si tous les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019entreprise ont re\u00e7u les salaires et indemnit\u00e9s auxquels ils ont droit.\n[4] Le 13 septembre 2018, \u00e0 l\u2019issue de son enqu\u00eate et se fondant sur l\u2019article 251.18 du Code, l\u2019inspectrice transmet \u00e0 l\u2019autre administrateur une lettre de d\u00e9termination pr\u00e9liminaire lui indiquant qu\u2019il est responsable de verser la somme de 100 036,93 $ pour des salaires et indemnit\u00e9s impay\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de 38 employ\u00e9s.\n[5] L\u2019autre administrateur ayant fait une proposition de faillite \u00e0 ses cr\u00e9anciers, l\u2019inspectrice transmet la lettre de d\u00e9termination pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 monsieur Monette. Le dossier ne d\u00e9montre pas \u00e0 quelle date celle-ci lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 achemin\u00e9e.\n[6] Le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2018, l\u2019inspectrice transmet \u00e0 monsieur Monette une lettre de d\u00e9termination r\u00e9vis\u00e9e. Elle le tient maintenant responsable de verser la somme de 334 259,01 $ \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de 132 employ\u00e9s. L\u2019inspectrice modifie par la suite le montant des sommes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es, le 22 septembre 2020 (137 212,10 $ \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de 139 employ\u00e9s), le 3 f\u00e9vrier 2021 (92 354,71 $ \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de 130 employ\u00e9s) et le 17 f\u00e9vrier 2021 (87 415,95 $ \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de 128 employ\u00e9s). Le 16 mars 2021, elle remet \u00e0 monsieur Monette un ordre de paiement formel en vertu du paragraphe 251.1(1) et de l\u2019article 251.18 du Code, lui ordonnant de verser la somme de 87 415,95 $ pour des salaires et indemnit\u00e9s impay\u00e9s.\n[7] Insatisfait, monsieur Monette conteste l\u2019ordre de paiement. Dans sa demande de r\u00e9vision, il soul\u00e8ve plusieurs motifs, dont le d\u00e9lai de plus de trois ans \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre le moment o\u00f9 l\u2019entreprise fait cession de ses biens le 16 septembre 2015 et le premier avis lui r\u00e9clamant des sommes en vertu du Code le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2018. Il soutient qu\u2019en vertu du paragraphe 251.01(2) du Code, un employ\u00e9 dispose d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de 6 mois \u00e0 compter du jour o\u00f9 le salaire aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre vers\u00e9 pour formuler une plainte contre son employeur. Les plaintes auraient donc d\u00fb \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9es au plus tard le 16 mars 2016 vu la faillite de l\u2019entreprise. Il ajoute qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais re\u00e7u, malgr\u00e9 une demande \u00e0 cet effet, copie des plaintes \u00e0 l\u2019origine de l\u2019enqu\u00eate et du mandat confi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019inspectrice. Il reproche \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019inspectrice de ne pas avoir tent\u00e9 un rapprochement entre les parties selon l\u2019article 251.03 du Code. Sa demande de r\u00e9vision est transmise au Conseil afin qu\u2019elle soit trait\u00e9e comme un appel, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 251.101(7) du Code.\n[8] Le 30 novembre 2022, le Conseil accueille en partie la demande de r\u00e9vision. Il modifie l\u2019ordre de paiement et retire, de la liste des anciens employ\u00e9s, tous les employ\u00e9s n\u2019ayant pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve de r\u00e9clamation aupr\u00e8s du syndic \u00e0 la faillite de l\u2019entreprise.\n[9] Dans une section de son analyse intitul\u00e9e \u00ab La prescription \u00bb, le Conseil souligne d\u2019abord que le d\u00e9lai entre la faillite de l\u2019entreprise et la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9clamation de l\u2019inspectrice peut para\u00eetre long, mais qu\u2019il \u00ab [r]este \u00e0 savoir cependant si ce d\u00e9lai fait en sorte que l\u2019ordre de paiement doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9 pour cause de prescription \u00bb (para. 50). Ensuite, il constate que les deux conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 251.18 du Code sont satisfaites, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que monsieur Monette \u00e9tait administrateur de l\u2019entreprise au moment o\u00f9 la cr\u00e9ance a pris naissance et que le recouvrement de la cr\u00e9ance aupr\u00e8s de celle-ci \u00e9tait impossible ou peu probable.\n[10] Le Conseil poursuit en soulignant que l\u2019article 251.18 du Code ne pr\u00e9voit aucun d\u00e9lai pour pr\u00e9senter une r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 un administrateur pour salaire impay\u00e9, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 154 de la LSA. Ce dernier pr\u00e9voit que la responsabilit\u00e9 des administrateurs n\u2019est engag\u00e9e que si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e du jour o\u00f9 la dette est devenue exigible, devient faillie au sens de la Loi sur la faillite et l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 et qu\u2019une r\u00e9clamation de cette dette est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du syndic. S\u2019appuyant sur une d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique dans In the Matter of Western Express Air Lines Inc., 2006 BCSC 1267 (Western Express), le Conseil conclut que les r\u00e9clamations des anciens employ\u00e9s qui n\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve de r\u00e9clamation au syndic sont prescrites aux termes de l\u2019article 154 de la LSA, et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, monsieur Monette ne leur doit aucune somme.\n[11] Devant cette Cour, le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada fait valoir que l\u2019article 154 de la LSA n\u2019impose pas un d\u00e9lai de prescription, mais plut\u00f4t une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019imputation de la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019administrateur en vertu de l\u2019article 154 de la LSA. Le Conseil ne pouvait, sous pr\u00e9texte de l\u2019absence d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de prescription pr\u00e9vu au Code, faire appel au droit suppl\u00e9tif du Qu\u00e9bec et ajouter aux conditions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019article 251.18 du Code en imposant l\u2019obligation pr\u00e9alable de d\u00e9poser une preuve de r\u00e9clamation aupr\u00e8s du syndic.\n[12] Le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral soutient \u00e9galement que l\u2019exercice d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation auquel s\u2019est livr\u00e9 le Conseil n\u2019est pas conforme au principe moderne d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative, ax\u00e9 sur le texte, le contexte et l\u2019objet de la disposition l\u00e9gislative. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il reproche au Conseil d\u2019avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Western Express comme un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent contraignant sans avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une analyse des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives en jeu. Il ajoute que le Conseil a omis de tenir compte de l\u2019objet du Code, qui se veut un r\u00e9gime complet, et des restrictions impos\u00e9es par son article 168. Enfin, il plaide qu\u2019en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une jurisprudence partag\u00e9e sur la question de la prescription, le Conseil devait justifier ses conclusions. Cela est d\u2019autant plus vrai puisque l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 154 de la LSA n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par aucune des parties.\n[13] Monsieur Monette n\u2019a pas produit de m\u00e9moire en l\u2019instance, ni comparu \u00e0 l\u2019audience de la pr\u00e9sente demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. La demande sera donc d\u00e9termin\u00e9e sur la base des observations \u00e9crites et orales du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et du dossier de demande, lequel comprend la r\u00e9ponse de monsieur Monette \u00e0 l\u2019inspectrice et sa demande de r\u00e9vision soumise au Conseil.\nII. Analyse [14] Comme la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire soul\u00e8ve l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019application par le Conseil de l\u2019article 251.18 du Code, la norme de contr\u00f4le est celle, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable (Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65 au para. 115).\n[15] Je suis d\u2019avis que la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire doit \u00eatre accueillie.\n[16] Par souci de commodit\u00e9, il est utile de reproduire les principales dispositions l\u00e9gislatives en cause.\n[17] L\u2019article 251.18 du Code se lit ainsi :\n251.18 Les administrateurs d\u2019une personne morale sont, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence d\u2019une somme \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 six mois de salaire, solidairement responsables du salaire et des autres indemnit\u00e9s auxquels l\u2019employ\u00e9 a droit sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente partie, dans la mesure o\u00f9 la cr\u00e9ance de l\u2019employ\u00e9 a pris naissance au cours de leur mandat et \u00e0 la condition que le recouvrement de la cr\u00e9ance aupr\u00e8s de la personne morale soit impossible ou peu probable.\n251.18 Directors of a corporation are jointly and severally liable for wages and other amounts to which an employee is entitled under this Part, to a maximum amount equivalent to six months\u2019 wages, to the extent that\n(a) the entitlement arose during the particular director\u2019s incumbency; and\n(b) recovery of the amount from the corporation is impossible or unlikely.\n[18] L\u2019article 154 de la LSA pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n154. Les administrateurs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sont solidairement responsables envers ses employ\u00e9s, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de six mois de salaire, pour les services rendus \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pendant leur administration respective.\n154. Directors of a corporation are solidarily liable to the employees of a corporation for all debts not exceeding six months\u2019 wages payable to each such employee for services performed for the corporation while they are directors of the corporation respectively.\nToutefois, leur responsabilit\u00e9 n\u2019est engag\u00e9e que si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est poursuivie dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e du jour o\u00f9 la dette est devenue exigible et que l\u2019avis d\u2019ex\u00e9cution du jugement obtenu contre elle est rapport\u00e9 insatisfait en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie ou si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, pendant cette p\u00e9riode, fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une ordonnance de mise en liquidation ou devient faillie au sens de la Loi sur la faillite et l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 (L.R.C. 1985, c. B-3) et qu\u2019une r\u00e9clamation de cette dette est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du liquidateur ou du syndic.\nHowever, a director is not liable unless the corporation is sued for the debt within one year after it becomes due and the notice of execution is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part or unless, during that period, a liquidation order is made against the corporation or it becomes bankrupt within the meaning of that expression in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3) and a claim for the debt is filed with the liquidator or the syndic.\n[19] Comme mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, le Conseil s\u2019appuie sur la d\u00e9cision Western Express pour justifier l\u2019application de l\u2019article 154 de la LSA en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Cette affaire met en cause la restructuration d\u2019une entreprise sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les arrangements avec les cr\u00e9anciers des compagnies, L.R.C. 1985, c. C-36, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie d\u2019une faillite quelques mois plus tard. La Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 se prononcer sur les sommes qui peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9es des administrateurs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 insolvable en vertu de l\u2019article 251.18 du Code. Constatant que le Code ne pr\u00e9voit pas de d\u00e9lai sp\u00e9cifique pour l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019un ordre de paiement, la Cour examine la relation entre l\u2019article 251.18 du Code et l\u2019article 119 de la Loi canadienne sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s par actions, L.R.C. 1985, c. C-44 (LCSA) qui traite de la responsabilit\u00e9 des administrateurs envers les employ\u00e9s. La Cour juge que la question devant elle est de d\u00e9terminer si les dispositions du Code et de la LCSA sont conflictuelles, contradictoires ou incompatibles entre elles.\n[20] La Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique d\u00e9termine que la pr\u00e9somption de chevauchement s\u2019applique. Cette pr\u00e9somption \u00e9tablit que, lorsque les dispositions de diff\u00e9rentes lois se chevauchent, leur interpr\u00e9tation doit faire en sorte d\u2019\u00e9viter les contradictions dans la mesure du possible. La Cour juge que chacune des dispositions pr\u00e9voit l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une responsabilit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour les administrateurs : pour le Code, sans limitation quant au moment pour pr\u00e9senter une r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 un administrateur, et pour la LCSA, exigeant qu\u2019une r\u00e9clamation soit prouv\u00e9e dans les six mois d\u2019une cession de biens ou d\u2019une ordonnance de faillite. La Cour conclut que l\u2019article 119 de la LCSA n\u2019entre pas en conflit avec l\u2019article 251.18 du Code et, qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, un ordre de paiement formel \u00e9mis \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un administrateur d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e en vertu de la LCSA n\u2019est valide, lorsque la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a fait faillite, que dans la mesure o\u00f9 une preuve de r\u00e9clamation est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du syndic dans les six mois de l\u2019ordonnance de faillite, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 119(2)c) de la LCSA (Western Express aux para. 18-20, 22-23).\n[21] Dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, estimant que \u00ab la situation engendr\u00e9e par la combinaison des dispositions du Code et de la [LSA] est, dans une certaine mesure, comparable \u00e0 la situation examin\u00e9e \u00bb dans Western Express, le Conseil juge \u00ab prescrites depuis l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu par l\u2019article 154 de la [LSA] \u00bb les r\u00e9clamations des anciens employ\u00e9s qui n\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve de r\u00e9clamation aupr\u00e8s du syndic (aux para. 58, 61-62).\n[22] Or, l\u2019analyse du Conseil ne tient pas compte du fait que, dans l\u2019affaire Western Express, il est question de l\u2019application de deux lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il s\u2019agit de l\u2019application d\u2019une loi provinciale \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime \u00e9tabli par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L\u2019analyse diff\u00e8re selon qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si deux lois adopt\u00e9es par le m\u00eame l\u00e9gislateur peuvent coexister sans conflit ou qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de savoir si une loi provinciale peut suppl\u00e9er \u00e0 une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en cas de silence de cette derni\u00e8re (voir notamment Ruth Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes, 7e \u00e9d., Markham (ON), LexisNexis, 2022, \u00a7 11.03[4]; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. St-Hilaire, 2001 CAF 63, autorisation de pourvoi \u00e0 la CSC refus\u00e9e, 28643 (29 novembre 2001)). Les motifs du Conseil ne font pas cette distinction.\n[23] Au surplus, le Conseil ne fait aucune analyse comparative des dispositions en cause et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, il n\u2019examine pas s\u2019il existe des diff\u00e9rences entre l\u2019article 119 de la LCSA et l\u2019article 154 de la LSA. Il est donc difficile de comprendre comment il a pu assimiler les deux dispositions et leur donner le m\u00eame effet puisque, bien qu\u2019elles soient similaires \u00e0 plusieurs \u00e9gards, il existe des diff\u00e9rences entre les deux.\n[24] \u00c0 ce propos, il importe de reproduire les extraits suivants de l\u2019article 119 de la LCSA :\n119 (1) Les administrateurs sont solidairement responsables, envers les employ\u00e9s de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, des dettes li\u00e9es aux services que ceux-ci ex\u00e9cutent pour le compte de cette derni\u00e8re pendant qu\u2019ils exercent leur mandat, et ce jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de six mois de salaire.\n119 (1) Directors of a corporation are jointly and severally, or solidarily, liable to employees of the corporation for all debts not exceeding six months wages payable to each such employee for services performed for the corporation while they are such directors respectively.\n(2) La responsabilit\u00e9 des administrateurs n\u2019est engag\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe (1) que dans l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des cas suivants :\n(2) A director is not liable under subsection (1) unless\nc) l\u2019existence de la cr\u00e9ance est \u00e9tablie dans les six mois d\u2019une cession de biens ou d\u2019une ordonnance de faillite frappant la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi sur la faillite et l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9.\n(c) the corporation has made an assignment or a bankruptcy order has been made against it under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and a claim for the debt has been proved within six months after the date of the assignment or bankruptcy order.\n(3) La responsabilit\u00e9 des administrateurs n\u2019est engag\u00e9e en vertu du pr\u00e9sent article que si l\u2019action est intent\u00e9e durant leur mandat ou dans les deux ans suivant la cessation de celui-ci.\n(3) A director, unless sued for a debt referred to in subsection (1) while a director or within two years after ceasing to be a director, is not liable under this section.\n[25] Comme on peut le constater, selon l\u2019alin\u00e9a 119(2)c) de la LCSA, la responsabilit\u00e9 des administrateurs n\u2019est engag\u00e9e que si l\u2019existence de la cr\u00e9ance salariale est \u00e9tablie dans les six mois d\u2019une cession de biens ou d\u2019une ordonnance de faillite frappant la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi sur la faillite et l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019article 154 de la LSA, la responsabilit\u00e9 des administrateurs n\u2019est engag\u00e9e que si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e du jour o\u00f9 la dette est devenue exigible, fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une ordonnance de mise en liquidation ou devient faillie et qu\u2019une r\u00e9clamation de cette dette est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du liquidateur ou du syndic. Il n\u2019est pas \u00e9vident, \u00e0 la lecture de l\u2019article 154 de la LSA, si le d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an s\u2019applique \u00e9galement au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une preuve de r\u00e9clamation aupr\u00e8s du liquidateur ou du syndic. De plus, aux termes du paragraphe 119(3) de la LCSA, la responsabilit\u00e9 des administrateurs n\u2019est engag\u00e9e que si l\u2019action est intent\u00e9e durant le mandat des administrateurs ou dans les deux ans suivant la cessation de celui-ci. La LSA ne pr\u00e9voit aucun d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9cis pour l\u2019exercice du recours contre les administrateurs.\n[26] \u00c0 la lecture de ces dispositions, l\u2019obligation pr\u00e9vue au deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de l\u2019article 154 de la LSA de d\u00e9poser une preuve de r\u00e9clamation aupr\u00e8s du syndic s\u2019apparente plus \u00e0 une condition pr\u00e9alable donnant ouverture \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 des administrateurs qu\u2019\u00e0 un d\u00e9lai de prescription.\n[27] Le Conseil ne consid\u00e8re pas non plus la pertinence d\u2019appliquer Western Express compte tenu des modifications apport\u00e9es au Code depuis cette d\u00e9cision. En 2006, le Code ne pr\u00e9voyait aucun d\u00e9lai pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t par un employ\u00e9 d\u2019une plainte pour salaire ou autre indemnit\u00e9 impay\u00e9s par l\u2019employeur. Selon le paragraphe 251.01(2) du Code, l\u2019employ\u00e9 dispose maintenant d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de six mois pour ce faire, de la derni\u00e8re date \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019employeur aurait d\u00fb verser le salaire ou indemnit\u00e9 en vertu de la partie III du Code. Ce d\u00e9lai a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 au Code en 2012 (Loi de 2012 sur l\u2019emploi et la croissance, L.C. 2012, c. 31, art. 223) et est entr\u00e9 en vigueur en 2014 (d\u00e9cret C.P. 2014-0162).\n[28] En recourant au droit provincial, le Conseil aurait d\u00fb en outre examiner s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas plut\u00f4t lieu d\u2019importer la prescription triennale g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9dict\u00e9e par l\u2019article 2925 du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec (Duverger c. 2553-4330 Qu\u00e9bec Inc. (A\u00e9ropro), 2016 CAF 243 au para. 24; Abel c. Asselin, 2014 CF 66 au para. 38) et d\u00e9terminer si cette prescription avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interrompue, par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte le 2 octobre 2015 ou par l\u2019envoi des lettres de d\u00e9termination pr\u00e9liminaire aux anciens administrateurs en 2018 (Abel aux para. 41-42; Bernlohr c. Anciens employ\u00e9s d\u2019Aveos Performance A\u00e9ronautique Inc., 2018 CanLII 146966 aux para. 89, 102-123).\n[29] Par ailleurs, les motifs du Conseil ne traitent pas non plus du contexte et de l\u2019objet du Code. L\u2019article 251.18 se trouve dans la partie III du Code, qui porte de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sur les normes du travail. Le Conseil n\u2019examine pas si l\u2019application de l\u2019article 154 de la LSA est compatible avec l\u2019objet de la partie III du Code ou s\u2019il a pour effet d\u2019\u00e9carter l\u2019intention qu\u2019avait le l\u00e9gislateur lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9dict\u00e9 l\u2019article 251.18 du Code (Banque de Montr\u00e9al c. Hall, [1990] 1 R.C.S. 121 aux pp. 151-152). Ses motifs ne tiennent pas compte du paragraphe 168(1) du Code, lequel pr\u00e9voit que la partie III du Code s\u2019applique nonobstant les r\u00e8gles de droit, usages, contrats ou arrangements incompatibles, sauf s\u2019ils sont plus favorables aux employ\u00e9s, ni des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ayant statu\u00e9 que le Code forme un tout complet (Ridke c. Coulson Aircrane Ltd., 2013 CF 1183 au para. 101; 942260 Ontario Ltd. c. Misty Press, 2004 CF 1384 au para. 18) ou ayant interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de la partie III du Code (Dynamex Canada Inc. c. Mamona, 2003 CAF 248).\n[30] Bien que le Conseil n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation formaliste de l\u2019article 251.18 du Code, ses motifs ne d\u00e9montrent pas qu\u2019il \u00e9tait conscient que la d\u00e9cision devait \u00eatre conforme au principe moderne d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative suivant lequel l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation doit tenir compte du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet de la loi (Vavilov aux para. 117-123).\n[31] Enfin, je note une certaine confusion dans le raisonnement du Conseil. Lorsqu\u2019il aborde son analyse sur la prescription, le Conseil se r\u00e9f\u00e8re au d\u00e9lai entre le moment de la faillite de l\u2019entreprise et la lettre de l\u2019inspectrice de d\u00e9termination pr\u00e9liminaire transmise \u00e0 l\u2019autre administrateur de l\u2019entreprise, le 13 septembre 2018. Il indique que, bien que ce d\u00e9lai puisse para\u00eetre long, il \u00ab [r]este \u00e0 savoir si ce d\u00e9lai fait en sorte que l\u2019ordre de paiement doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9 pour cause de prescription \u00bb (au para. 50). Alors que ces commentaires semblent r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la fois au d\u00e9lai dont dispose l\u2019inspectrice pour aviser les administrateurs de leur responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle et \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de son enqu\u00eate, l\u2019analyse du Conseil et sa conclusion portent plut\u00f4t sur ce qui s\u2019apparente \u00e0 une condition d\u2019ouverture pour exercer un recours contre les administrateurs (aux para. 56-62).\n[32] Certaines d\u00e9cisions se sont int\u00e9ress\u00e9es au d\u00e9lai dont dispose l\u2019inspectrice pour faire enqu\u00eate, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire pour aviser les administrateurs qu\u2019ils pourraient \u00eatre tenus responsables sous l\u2019article 251.18 du Code ou pour \u00e9mettre un ordre de paiement (Abel aux para. 46, 49; Bernlohr aux para. 89, 102-123; Re Rutherford and Doyle, 2013 CarswellNat 1199 aux para. 61-65). Les motifs du Conseil ne permettent pas de conclure qu\u2019il s\u2019agit du d\u00e9lai dont se pr\u00e9occupe le Conseil.\n[33] L\u2019absence d\u2019analyse, de justification et de coh\u00e9rence dans les motifs du Conseil fait en sorte qu\u2019il est difficile de comprendre le fondement de la d\u00e9cision. Il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019intervention de la Cour est justifi\u00e9e (Vavilov aux para. 85-86, 105).\n[34] En terminant, je me permets quelques commentaires additionnels.\n[35] L\u2019absence d\u2019information et de documentation au dossier du demandeur n\u2019a pas facilit\u00e9 le travail de cette Cour. Lors de l\u2019audience, la Cour a soulign\u00e9 au Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ses interrogations ainsi que ses pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments du dossier.\n[36] \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, la Cour s\u2019est interrog\u00e9e sur l\u2019interaction entre les dispositions du Code, de la Loi sur le Programme de protection des salari\u00e9s, L.C. 2005, c. 47, art. 1, qui pr\u00e9voit le versement de prestations aux personnes physiques titulaires de cr\u00e9ances salariales sur un employeur insolvable, et de la Loi sur la faillite et l\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9.\n[37] Cette interrogation d\u00e9coule entre autres du fait qu\u2019au paragraphe 10 de ses motifs, le Conseil mentionne que la \u00ab plainte \u00bb du 2 octobre 2015 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du Programme de protection des salari\u00e9s. Toutefois, au paragraphe 7 de son m\u00e9moire, le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral affirme que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 251.01 du Code. L\u2019affidavit de l\u2019inspectrice n\u2019est d\u2019aucun secours puisqu\u2019elle ne pr\u00e9cise pas explicitement le fondement de la plainte.\n[38] Puisqu\u2019\u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, une demande de prestations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi sur le Programme de protection des salari\u00e9s diff\u00e8re d\u2019une plainte pour salaire ou autre indemnit\u00e9 impay\u00e9s en vertu de l\u2019article 251.01 du Code, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 utile que la Cour puisse confirmer sous quel r\u00e9gime la \u00ab plainte \u00bb du 2 octobre 2015 a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite. Ceci est d\u2019autant plus vrai consid\u00e9rant que l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 au Programme de protection des salari\u00e9s repose notamment sur la faillite de l\u2019entreprise, ce qui explique l\u2019importance de d\u00e9poser une preuve de r\u00e9clamation au syndic, mentionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)d) du R\u00e8glement sur le Programme de protection des salari\u00e9s, D.O.R.S.\/2008-222. Le d\u00e9lai pour d\u00e9poser une plainte en vertu du Code (alin\u00e9a 251.01(2)a)) diff\u00e8re \u00e9galement de celui pour pr\u00e9senter une demande en vertu du Programme de protection des salari\u00e9s (R\u00e8glement, article 9). Malheureusement, une copie de la \u00ab plainte \u00bb n\u2019est pas au dossier du demandeur.\n[39] \u00c9galement, dans son rapport pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de la demande de r\u00e9vision d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par monsieur Monette, l\u2019inspectrice indique que 35 employ\u00e9s se sont inscrits au Programme de protection des salari\u00e9s au moment de la faillite r\u00e9clamant le paiement de salaire et diverses indemnit\u00e9s en vertu du Code. Elle pr\u00e9cise avoir aussi \u00ab r\u00e9clam\u00e9 pour les employ\u00e9s qui ne se sont pas inscrits au programme de protection des salari\u00e9s selon les directives re\u00e7ues bas\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9cision Western Express Air Lines (annexe 2) \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019entreprise est enregistr\u00e9e au \u2018Registraire des entreprises du Qu\u00e9bec\u2019 \u00bb (dossier du demandeur \u00e0 la p. 91).\n[40] D\u2019une part, les directives sur lesquelles l\u2019inspectrice s\u2019appuie ne sont pas au dossier. Consid\u00e9rant que le Conseil affirme express\u00e9ment ne pas \u00eatre d\u2019accord avec l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que fait l\u2019inspectrice de la d\u00e9cision Western Express, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 utile de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019une explication du contenu de ces directives, et ce m\u00eame si elles ne lient pas la Cour.\n[41] D\u2019autre part, le dossier ne permet pas de d\u00e9terminer la source du pouvoir autorisant l\u2019inspectrice \u00e0 \u00e9largir son enqu\u00eate \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des salari\u00e9s et de r\u00e9clamer aux administrateurs les montants impay\u00e9s pour tous les employ\u00e9s. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a expliqu\u00e9 que le pouvoir d\u2019enqu\u00eate de l\u2019inspectrice d\u00e9coulait des articles 248 et 249 du Code et qu\u2019une seule plainte valait pour l\u2019ensemble des employ\u00e9s m\u00eame s\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de plainte dans le d\u00e9lai prescrit par le Code.\n[42] Le dossier ne d\u00e9montre pas si l\u2019inspectrice a \u00e9mis un avis aux anciens administrateurs les informant qu\u2019elle ferait enqu\u00eate au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019ensemble des anciens employ\u00e9s de l\u2019entreprise faillie ou si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en communication avec monsieur Monette avant de lui transmettre la lettre de d\u00e9termination r\u00e9vis\u00e9e plus de trois ans apr\u00e8s la faillite de l\u2019entreprise. Monsieur Monette affirme dans sa demande de r\u00e9vision n\u2019avoir re\u00e7u aucune copie des plaintes ayant initi\u00e9 l\u2019enqu\u00eate de l\u2019inspectrice ou du mandat qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re. Or, la date de ces communications pourrait s\u2019av\u00e9rer d\u00e9terminante si l\u2019inspectrice avait trois ans pour informer monsieur Monette de sa responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle concernant les salaires et autres montants impay\u00e9s dans le cas d\u2019une enqu\u00eate effectu\u00e9e en vertu du Code.\n[43] Je n\u2019en dirai pas plus \u00e0 ce sujet. Je laisse le soin au Conseil de se pencher sur ces questions.\n[44] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je suis d\u2019avis que la pr\u00e9sente demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire devrait \u00eatre accueillie, j\u2019annulerais la d\u00e9cision du Conseil et je retournerais le dossier au Conseil, diff\u00e9remment constitu\u00e9, afin qu\u2019il rende une nouvelle d\u00e9cision en tenant compte des pr\u00e9sents motifs. Comme le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ne les r\u00e9clame plus dans son m\u00e9moire, je propose qu\u2019aucuns d\u00e9pens ne soient accord\u00e9s.\n\u00ab Sylvie E.

Introduction\n[1] L\u2019appelant, M. Zoghbi, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre Air Canada en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6, et souhaitait obtenir une indemnisation financi\u00e8re, entre autres r\u00e9parations.\n[2] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a rejet\u00e9 la plainte de l\u2019appelant au motif que l\u2019indemnisation financi\u00e8re n\u2019est pas possible en raison d\u2019une convention internationale int\u00e9gr\u00e9e dans le droit interne du Canada. Elle a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident et manifeste que la plainte \u00e9tait \u00ab frivole \u00bb, pour reprendre le qualificatif employ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)d) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[3] L\u2019appelant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019annuler la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (le juge Fothergill) a accueilli la demande en partie, ayant jug\u00e9 que, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible d\u2019ordonner d\u2019indemnisation financi\u00e8re, l\u2019appelant aurait pu avoir droit \u00e0 d\u2019autres mesures de r\u00e9paration : 2021 CF 1154.\n[4] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la Commission en lui demandant d\u2019examiner si d\u2019autres r\u00e9parations \u00e9taient possibles et s\u2019il existait d\u2019autres motifs de rejeter la plainte. Il existait deux autres motifs possibles : l\u2019appelant avait sign\u00e9 une d\u00e9charge dans le cadre d\u2019un r\u00e8glement et la plainte de l\u2019appelant pouvait \u00eatre plut\u00f4t instruite par l\u2019Office des transports du Canada.\n[5] D\u00e9\u00e7u par le fait que la majeure partie de sa plainte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue, l\u2019appelant interjette appel devant notre Cour. Son appel porte essentiellement sur la convention internationale et sur la question de savoir si cette derni\u00e8re fait obstacle \u00e0 sa demande d\u2019indemnisation financi\u00e8re. Sur ce point, je juge que les arguments de l\u2019appelant ne sont pas fond\u00e9s : il \u00e9tait raisonnable de la part de la Commission de conclure que la convention internationale s\u2019applique en vertu de la loi qui l\u2019int\u00e8gre dans le droit interne du Canada et qu\u2019elle exclut les dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[6] Toutefois, l\u2019appelant all\u00e9guait que la loi int\u00e9grant la convention internationale dans le droit interne du Canada portait atteinte \u00e0 ses droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 garantis par l\u2019article 15 de la Charte. La Commission n\u2019a jamais examin\u00e9 cette question. Ainsi, elle doit \u00e9galement examiner cette question lors du r\u00e9examen ordonn\u00e9 par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, tout comme les deux autres motifs. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel en partie.\nB. Les faits essentiels\n1) L\u2019incident ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte\n[7] L\u2019appelant est un citoyen canadien d\u2019origine libanaise. Il affirme que des inconnus pouvaient identifier sa race, son origine ethnique et sa couleur en raison de son nom, de son apparence, de son accent et du fait qu\u2019il parle l\u2019arabe. Il avait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 un vol d\u2019Air Canada pour se rendre de Halifax \u00e0 Londres.\n[8] Apr\u00e8s \u00eatre mont\u00e9 \u00e0 bord de l\u2019avion, alors qu\u2019il parlait au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone en arabe, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son veston sur le si\u00e8ge \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du sien. Une agente de bord lui a dit de d\u00e9placer son veston. Contrari\u00e9 par le ton de l\u2019agente de bord, l\u2019appelant a exprim\u00e9 son m\u00e9contentement \u2014 il reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu brusque \u2014 et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 parler \u00e0 un gestionnaire.\n[9] Peu apr\u00e8s, un agent d\u2019Air Canada a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de sortir sur la passerelle menant \u00e0 l\u2019avion pour discuter. L\u2019agent a ensuite inform\u00e9 l\u2019appelant qu\u2019il ne serait pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre le vol. Selon un rapport pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par Air Canada, l\u2019appelant avait fait [traduction] \u00ab usage de violence verbale envers une agente de bord et le personnel d\u2019embarquement \u00bb. \u00c0 la suite du rapport, Air Canada a pris d\u2019autres mesures : le transporteur a assujetti l\u2019appelant \u00e0 une interdiction de transport g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n2) La plainte\n[10] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission une plainte dans laquelle il all\u00e8gue qu\u2019Air Canada a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit sur le fondement de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, de la couleur et\/ou de la religion, soit des motifs de distinction illicite pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. L\u2019appelant a sollicit\u00e9 notamment une indemnisation financi\u00e8re.\n3) Le cadre juridique g\u00e9n\u00e9ral concernant les voyages internationaux\n[11] La Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien, L.R.C. (1985), ch. C\u201126, int\u00e8gre dans le droit interne du Canada la Convention pour l\u2019unification de certaines r\u00e8gles relatives au transport a\u00e9rien international, 2242 RTNU 309 (la Convention de Montr\u00e9al) : voir le paragraphe 2(2.1).\n[12] La Convention de Montr\u00e9al \u00e9tablit des r\u00e8gles exclusives concernant les circonstances dans lesquelles la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019une compagnie a\u00e9rienne est engag\u00e9e en cas d\u2019incidents qui surviennent au cours d\u2019un transport a\u00e9rien international et la port\u00e9e de cette responsabilit\u00e9. Elle interdit les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats p\u00e9cuniaires en cas d\u2019incidents qui surviennent au cours d\u2019un transport a\u00e9rien international, y compris lors de l\u2019embarquement, comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019article 17 de la Convention de Montr\u00e9al pr\u00e9voit la possibilit\u00e9 de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats p\u00e9cuniaires uniquement en cas \u00ab de mort ou de l\u00e9sion corporelle subie par un passager \u00bb lorsque \u00ab l\u2019accident [...] s\u2019est produit \u00e0 bord de l\u2019a\u00e9ronef ou au cours de toutes op\u00e9rations d\u2019embarquement ou de d\u00e9barquement \u00bb. De plus, l\u2019article 29 indique qu\u2019\u00ab on ne pourra pas obtenir de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats punitifs ou exemplaires ni de dommages \u00e0 un titre autre que la r\u00e9paration \u00bb.\n[13] Tout au long de la pr\u00e9sente instance, Air Canada a soutenu que la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien fait obstacle \u00e0 la demande d\u2019indemnisation financi\u00e8re de l\u2019appelant fond\u00e9e sur une violation des droits de la personne.\n4) L\u2019instance devant la Commission\n[14] Peu apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, la Commission a inform\u00e9 l\u2019appelant qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9parait un rapport d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable fond\u00e9 sur les articles 40 et 41 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. En raison de l\u2019application de la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien, la Commission a mis en doute sa comp\u00e9tence pour accorder une indemnisation financi\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appelant. Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u des observations sur ce point, la Commission a conclu que le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour accorder des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Elle a rejet\u00e9 la plainte dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9.\n[15] Ayant rejet\u00e9 la plainte dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, la Commission n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenue d\u2019examiner la question de la d\u00e9charge ni celle de savoir si l\u2019Office des transports du Canada \u00e9tait mieux plac\u00e9 pour instruire la plainte de l\u2019appelant.\n[16] L\u2019enqu\u00eateuse de la Commission a pris acte de la revendication de l\u2019appelant relative \u00e0 ses droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 garantis par la Charte, mais elle ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9e sur ce point. L\u2019appelant a formul\u00e9 la revendication relative \u00e0 ses droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 en ces termes :\n[traduction]\n\u00c0 titre subsidiaire, si la Convention de Montr\u00e9al s\u2019appliquait et si elle limitait les droits que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne garantit \u00e0 [l\u2019appelant], alors la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien mettant en \u0153uvre la Convention violerait l\u2019article 15 de la Charte et devrait, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00eatre \u00ab interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re restrictive \u00bb.\n[17] Lorsque la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rejeter la plainte, elle ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9e sur la revendication de l\u2019appelant selon laquelle la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien int\u00e9grant la Convention de Montr\u00e9al porte atteinte aux droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que lui garantit l\u2019article 15 de la Charte.\n5) L\u2019instance devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\n[18] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 au contr\u00f4le de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. Ce faisant, elle a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelant selon lequel la d\u00e9cision en cause \u00e9tait susceptible de contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte.\n[19] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9 raisonnables l\u2019analyse et les conclusions de la Commission concernant la Convention de Montr\u00e9al et son int\u00e9gration dans le droit interne du Canada par la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien.\n[20] Toutefois, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu (aux paragraphes 46 et 52 de ses motifs) que l\u2019appelant pouvait se pr\u00e9valoir d\u2019autres recours en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui ne sont pas exclus par la Convention de Montr\u00e9al et la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien. Par exemple, un tribunal pourrait ordonner \u00e0 Air Canada de prendre \u00ab des mesures de redressement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019acte discriminatoire reproch\u00e9 ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables \u00bb (au paragraphe 52), notamment en formant son personnel \u00e0 g\u00e9rer des situations similaires d\u2019une fa\u00e7on plus respectueuse des droits. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la Commission pour qu\u2019elle se prononce sur ces questions.\n[21] Devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, l\u2019appelant a fait valoir sa revendication relative \u00e0 ses droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 garantis par la Charte. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a refus\u00e9 de se prononcer \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard au motif que bien peu d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s quant aux aspects principaux de la revendication.\n[22] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a par ailleurs conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de statuer sur la revendication de l\u2019appelant relative \u00e0 ses droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 pour trancher la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Compte tenu de cette conclusion et du fait que la Commission n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 de la revendication de l\u2019appelant relative \u00e0 ses droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, aucun examen du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la revendication n\u2019a eu lieu. Cette revendication est tout simplement pass\u00e9e entre les mailles du filet.\n6) L\u2019instance devant notre Cour\n[23] Devant notre Cour, l\u2019appelant soul\u00e8ve toutes les questions qu\u2019il a port\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il a divis\u00e9 ses arguments en plusieurs parties. Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re regrouper ses observations en six grandes questions. Par pur souci de simplicit\u00e9 du libell\u00e9 des questions, je les formule ci\u2011apr\u00e8s comme si la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte s\u2019appliquait, mais, comme nous le verrons, c\u2019est la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable qui s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[24] Voici les questions :\n1)Quelle est la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable?\n2)La Commission avait-elle comp\u00e9tence ou a-t-elle conclu de mani\u00e8re raisonnable qu\u2019elle avait comp\u00e9tence pour interpr\u00e9ter la Convention de Montr\u00e9al et la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien?\n3)Sur le plan de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, la Convention de Montr\u00e9al et la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien font-elles obstacle \u00e0 la plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne de l\u2019appelant?\n4)La Commission aurait-elle d\u00fb tenir compte de l\u2019article 6 de la Convention internationale sur l\u2019\u00e9limination de toutes les formes de discrimination raciale, R.T . Can 1970 no 28?\n5)La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne l\u2019emporte-t-elle sur la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien?\n6)La Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien porte-t-elle atteinte aux droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 garantis par l\u2019article 15 de la Charte?\n[25] Les questions 4) et 5) n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es devant la Commission alors qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 raisonnable qu\u2019elles le soient, d\u2019autant plus que le plaignant \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par M. G\u00e1bor Luk\u00e1cs, qui a souvent plaid\u00e9 devant les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et qui est bien au fait des questions juridiques. En fait, M. Luk\u00e1cs est intervenu \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises devant la Commission concernant des questions juridiques, mais il a choisi de ne pas soulever les questions 4) et 5) devant elle.\n[26] L\u2019appelant soul\u00e8ve maintenant les questions 4) et 5) pour la premi\u00e8re fois en contr\u00f4le judiciaire. La cour de r\u00e9vision ne devrait pas examiner les questions qui sont soulev\u00e9es devant elle pour la premi\u00e8re fois : Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) c. Alberta Teachers\u2019 Association, 2011 CSC 61, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 654, par. 22 et 23.\n[27] Ce principe a pour fondement \u2014 qui est judicieux \u2014que la l\u00e9gislation r\u00e9gissant un r\u00e9gime administratif conf\u00e8re au d\u00e9cideur administratif, et non \u00e0 la cour de r\u00e9vision, le pouvoir de trancher toutes les questions relatives au fond de l\u2019affaire. Bien que r\u00e9cemment la Cour supr\u00eame ait parfois tranch\u00e9 de nouvelles questions relatives au fond d\u2019une affaire (voir, p. ex., Mason c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2023 CSC 21), il convient de consid\u00e9rer les arr\u00eats concern\u00e9s comme des cas d\u2019exception, o\u00f9 la Cour supr\u00eame a jug\u00e9, \u00e0 tort ou \u00e0 raison, que la question dont elle \u00e9tait saisie \u00e9tait claire, et non comme exprimant un d\u00e9part par rapport \u00e0 la position de longue date, incontestablement solide, expos\u00e9e dans les arr\u00eats Alberta Teachers : Klos c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2023 CAF 205, par. 8; Terra Reproductions Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2023 CAF 214, par. 6; voir \u00e9galement P. Daly, \u00ab The Signal and the Noise in Administrative Law \u00bb, Revue de droit de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 du Nouveau-Brunswick, vol. 68 (2017), 68 \u00e0 86.\n[28] N\u00e9anmoins, en fin de compte, pour que l\u2019appelant obtienne r\u00e9ponse pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00e0 ses moyens d\u2019appel, j\u2019examinerai les questions 4) et 5) et je d\u00e9montrerai que sa position est de toute fa\u00e7on sans fondement.\n[29] La question 6) a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e devant la Commission, mais, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, elle n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 cette question sur le fond. Suivant l\u2019arr\u00eat Alberta Teachers, elle n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb le faire : voir les paragraphes 26 et 27 des pr\u00e9sents motifs.\n[30] Le fait que la question 6) soit de nature constitutionnelle ne change rien \u00e0 la situation. Lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question de droit constitutionnel qui rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence du d\u00e9cideur administratif, ce dernier, en tant que juge du fond, est le mieux plac\u00e9 pour l\u2019entendre. Dans ces circonstances, la partie qui pr\u00e9sente la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire ne peut pas passer outre la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal pour s\u2019adresser directement \u00e0 la cour de r\u00e9vision : Okwuobi c. Commission scolaire Lester B. Pearson; Casimir c. Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral); Zorrilla c. Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CSC 16, [2005] 1 R.C.S. 257, par. 28 \u00e0 55.\n[31] Lorsque, comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le d\u00e9cideur administratif ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9 sur une question constitutionnelle dont il \u00e9tait saisi et que le demandeur soutient que ce d\u00e9cideur avait comp\u00e9tence pour la trancher, le demandeur devrait attaquer cette omission et demander que la question constitutionnelle soit renvoy\u00e9e pour nouvelle d\u00e9cision. La Commission, qui n\u2019est pas une cour de r\u00e9vision, a le pouvoir d\u2019examiner si elle a comp\u00e9tence pour juger la question constitutionnelle et, dans l\u2019affirmative, si la question constitutionnelle ainsi que toute autre question doivent \u00eatre envoy\u00e9es au Tribunal pour examen. Comme nous le verrons, la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question de savoir si la Commission a comp\u00e9tence pour juger la question constitutionnelle d\u00e9pend du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) c. Martin; Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) c. Laseur, 2003 CSC 54, [2003] 2 R.C.S. 504 [Martin], examin\u00e9 plus loin.\n[32] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de et du fait que la Commission \u2014 l\u2019organisme comp\u00e9tent en la mati\u00e8re \u2014 se penchera sur la question 6 lors du nouvel examen, je refuse de me prononcer davantage \u00e0 ce sujet.\nC. Analyse\n1) Quelle est la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable?\n[33] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a indiqu\u00e9 aux paragraphes 25 \u00e0 29 de ses motifs que la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable \u00e9tait celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. Elle a fait observer que les d\u00e9cisions par lesquelles la Commission rejette des plaintes au titre de l\u2019article 41 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00ab peuvent normalement faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le par la Cour selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable \u00bb (par. 25). Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune des exceptions au contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable ne s\u2019appliquait.\n[34] Je souscris aux motifs de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, que je fais miens.\n[35] L\u2019appelant soutient que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission devrait \u00eatre examin\u00e9e selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte compte tenu de la question fondamentale de savoir si la Commission a comp\u00e9tence pour se prononcer sur des questions de droit. Mais il n\u2019est pas reconnu que la question de savoir si un d\u00e9cideur administratif a comp\u00e9tence constitue un motif d\u2019appliquer la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la comp\u00e9tence \u2014 \u00e0 savoir si un d\u00e9cideur administratif est habilit\u00e9 par une loi \u00e0 faire quelque chose \u2014 est plut\u00f4t une question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la loi, laquelle est assujettie \u00e0 la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable : Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653, par. 115.\n[36] L\u2019appelant fait en outre valoir que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019application de la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien sont des questions de droit g\u00e9n\u00e9rales qui rev\u00eatent une importance capitale pour le syst\u00e8me juridique. De telles questions commandent l\u2019application de la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte. Mais la question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne rel\u00e8ve pas de cette cat\u00e9gorie.\n[37] L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019application d\u2019une loi, en l\u2019occurrence la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien, sont importantes pour les passagers de vols vers l\u2019\u00e9tranger qui souhaitent \u00e9ventuellement demander de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, mais sans ramifications plus vastes. Contrairement aux questions quasi constitutionnelles qui se posent dans des contextes multiples ou qui ont des ramifications constitutionnelles, la question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019exige pas une seule r\u00e9ponse correcte au motif de la primaut\u00e9 du droit : Mouvement la\u00efque qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois c. Saguenay (Ville), 2015 CSC 16, [2015] 2 R.C.S. 3 (l\u2019obligation de neutralit\u00e9 religieuse de l\u2019\u00c9tat); Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) c. University of Calgary, 2016 CSC 53, [2016] 2 R.C.S. 555 (les limites du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat, un droit garanti par l\u2019article 8 de la Charte); Chagnon c. Syndicat de la fonction publique et parapublique du Qu\u00e9bec, 2018 CSC 39 [2018] 2 R.C.S. 687 (la port\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge parlementaire, un principe constitutionnel).\n[38] L\u2019appelant soutient que derri\u00e8re l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien se cache la Convention de Montr\u00e9al, dont l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation est une question de port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il fait valoir que les trait\u00e9s, qui s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 de nombreux contextes diff\u00e9rents, devraient faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation uniforme et unique. Comme nous le verrons, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Convention de Montr\u00e9al dans le contexte qui nous occupe est parfaitement claire. Quelle que soit la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable, la Convention de Montr\u00e9al fait obstacle \u00e0 la demande de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019appelant contre Air Canada en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[39] Il ne fait aucun doute que la violation pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e des droits de la personne par une entit\u00e9 priv\u00e9e dans ces circonstances rev\u00eat une grande importance pour l\u2019appelant. Il ne fait \u00e9galement aucun doute que les droits de la personne sont importants, qu\u2019ils sont parfois controvers\u00e9s et qu\u2019ils sont d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Cependant, l\u2019importance pour les parties devant la Cour et les questions importantes en soi n\u2019entra\u00eenent pas l\u2019application de l\u2019exception donnant lieu \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le reposant sur la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte : voir Vavilov, par. 58 \u00e0 62. Je conviens avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e que la question dont la Cour est saisie ne d\u00e9passe pas le r\u00e9gime administratif de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne quant \u00e0 la protection des droits de la personne et ne concerne que la question des r\u00e9parations disponibles, qui plus est uniquement dans le contexte des passagers voyageant par vols internationaux.\n[40] Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a choisi la norme de contr\u00f4le appropri\u00e9e, soit celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable.\n2) La Commission avait-elle comp\u00e9tence ou a-t-elle conclu de mani\u00e8re raisonnable qu\u2019elle avait comp\u00e9tence pour interpr\u00e9ter la Convention de Montr\u00e9al et la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien?\n[41] L\u2019appelant fait valoir que la Commission ne peut pas trancher de questions de droit au\u2011del\u00e0 de sa loi habilitante et que le r\u00f4le de la Commission consiste plut\u00f4t \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier s\u2019il existe une preuve suffisante. Il invoque l\u2019arr\u00eat Cooper c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1996] 3 R.C.S. 854, par. 53.\n[42] Sur cette question, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu (aux paragraphes 30 \u00e0 39 de ses motifs) que les attributions de la Commission ne sont pas limit\u00e9es de la sorte. Je suis d\u2019accord avec la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, pour les motifs qu\u2019elle a expos\u00e9s. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je souscris \u00e9galement en grande partie aux observations de la Commission, qui est intervenue sur cette question.\n[43] Comme l\u2019a not\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Cour supr\u00eame a r\u00e9examin\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat Cooper dans l\u2019affaire Martin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, et s\u2019en est \u00e9cart\u00e9e en grande partie. L\u2019arr\u00eat Martin \u00e9taye l\u2019argument selon lequel le d\u00e9cideur administratif qui a comp\u00e9tence, expresse ou implicite, pour trancher les questions de droit d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019application d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir le pouvoir d\u2019examiner les questions juridiques qui lui sont soumises. Comme il ressort de l\u2019arr\u00eat Martin, cela comprend les questions de droit constitutionnel.\n[44] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Martin, la Cour supr\u00eame a affirm\u00e9 que la conclusion pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019elle avait tir\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Cooper \u2014 portant que la Commission n\u2019avait aucun pouvoir expr\u00e8s ou implicite de trancher les questions de droit d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u2014 demeurait valable. Mais elle a ensuite ajout\u00e9 que, \u00ab [d]ans la mesure o\u00f9 [Cooper] est incompatible avec [Martin], [...] le raisonnement des juges majoritaires dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Cooper n\u2019est plus valable \u00bb (par. 47).\n[45] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Cooper, la Cour supr\u00eame a accord\u00e9 de l\u2019importance \u00e0 la distinction entre les questions de droit g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et les questions de droit limit\u00e9es, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la question de savoir si le d\u00e9cideur administratif exerce un pouvoir d\u00e9cisionnel, plut\u00f4t que de simples fonctions d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable. \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019arr\u00eat Martin, le droit a chang\u00e9. Au paragraphe 47 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Martin, la Cour supr\u00eame a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment statu\u00e9 que la nature juridictionnelle de l\u2019organisme administratif compte pour tr\u00e8s peu. La cons\u00e9quence claire est que les organismes d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable, tels que la Commission, ont le pouvoir d\u2019examiner des questions de droit dans la mesure n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions.\n[46] La notion de comp\u00e9tence implicite ou de comp\u00e9tence pour l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Martin m\u00e9rite un examen plus attentif. Au paragraphe 41 de ses motifs, la Cour supr\u00eame fait remarquer qu\u2019il faut tenir compte, entre autres facteurs, de \u00ab la mission que la loi confie au tribunal administratif \u00bb et des questions de savoir \u00ab s\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de trancher des questions de droit pour l\u2019accomplir efficacement \u00bb et si le fait de \u00ab priver le tribunal du pouvoir de trancher des questions de droit nuirait \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019accomplir la mission qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9e \u00bb. Ce n\u2019est pas sans rappeler l\u2019exercice consistant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer les pouvoirs implicites des tribunaux dont la Cour supr\u00eame a fait une analyse utile dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Chrysler Canada Ltd. c. Canada (Tribunal de la concurrence), [1992] 2 R.C.S. 394.\n[47] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le r\u00f4le de la Commission sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne consiste \u00e0 exercer des fonctions d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable afin de rejeter les plaintes qui ne sauraient \u00eatre accueillies sur le fondement des faits ou du droit. Une plainte qui ne saurait \u00eatre accueillie sur le fondement des faits ou du droit ne devrait pas \u00eatre adress\u00e9e au Tribunal pour qu\u2019il tienne une audience, laquelle demande beaucoup de temps et de ressources. L\u2019objectif est d\u2019assurer l\u2019utilisation judicieuse des ressources et le traitement efficace des plaintes. Toute conclusion emp\u00eachant la Commission d\u2019examiner si une loi a pour effet de vouer une plainte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chec serait contraire au but de la loi.\n[48] Pour faire bonne mesure, notre Cour a statu\u00e9 \u00e0 trois reprises que la Commission jouit dans ses fonctions d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable d\u2019une grande latitude et qu\u2019elle a notamment la capacit\u00e9 de juger une plainte en fonction du droit applicable pour \u00e9tablir si elle a une chance d\u2019\u00eatre accueillie : Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Ennis, 2021 CAF 95, [2021] 4 R.C.F. 154, par. 61; Gregg c. Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, 2019 CAF 218 (motifs dissidents, mais auxquels la majorit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas oppos\u00e9e sur ce point); Bell Canada c. Syndicat canadien des communications, de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et du papier, [1999] 1 C.F. 113, [1998] A.C.F. no 1609 (C.A.), par. 38; voir aussi Northcott c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2021 CF 289. Dans d\u2019autres cas, la Cour a d\u00fb d\u00e9cider si d\u2019autres organismes administratifs auraient d\u00fb entendre la plainte, ce qui l\u2019a amen\u00e9e \u00e0 examiner et \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter les lois r\u00e9gissant ces d\u00e9cideurs : Canada (Chambre des communes) c. Vaid, 2005 CSC 30, [2005] 1 R.C.S. 667, par. 99; Eadie c. MTS Inc., 2015 CAF 173, [2016] 1 R.C.F. 173, par. 96 \u00e0 105; MacFarlane c. Day & Ross Inc., 2010 CF 556, [2011] 4 R.C.F. 117, par. 73 et 74.\n[49] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Commission a examin\u00e9 si l\u2019appelant disposait d\u2019autres voies de droit pour obtenir r\u00e9paration contre la violation all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de droits de la personne commise \u00e0 son endroit, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la Convention de Montr\u00e9al et de la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien. Elle n\u2019a pas statu\u00e9 sur le fond de la plainte de l\u2019appelant; elle a plut\u00f4t jug\u00e9 si la plainte devait \u00eatre entendue en se fondant sur des points de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence objectifs, dont les lois et la jurisprudence pertinentes. Elle a conclu que cette t\u00e2che relevait des attributions que lui conf\u00e8re l\u2019article 41 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[50] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9 que la conclusion de la Commission \u00e9tait raisonnable. Je suis d\u2019accord pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent et pour les motifs expos\u00e9s par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n3) Sur le plan de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, la Convention de Montr\u00e9al et la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien font-elles obstacle \u00e0 la plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne de l\u2019appelant?\n[51] La Commission a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette question par l\u2019affirmative. Ce faisant, elle a agi raisonnablement.\n[52] Dans ses motifs, la Commission a fait siens les paragraphes 60 \u00e0 68 du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Le rapport commence par un examen de la Convention de Montr\u00e9al et de la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien (au paragraphe 60), et il y est not\u00e9, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, que l\u2019article 17 de la Convention de Montr\u00e9al pr\u00e9voit la possibilit\u00e9 de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats p\u00e9cuniaires uniquement en cas \u00ab de mort ou de l\u00e9sion corporelle subie par un passager \u00bb lorsque \u00ab l\u2019accident [...] s\u2019est produit \u00e0 bord de l\u2019a\u00e9ronef ou au cours de toutes op\u00e9rations d\u2019embarquement ou de d\u00e9barquement \u00bb.\n[53] Toutefois, le rapport n\u2019a pas conclu \u00e0 l\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 de la demande de l\u2019appelant. On y pose, au paragraphe 62, la question de savoir si la Convention de Montr\u00e9al permet les demandes fond\u00e9es sur des [traduction] \u00ab droits fondamentaux quasi constitutionnels \u00bb.\n[54] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, comme on l\u2019indique au paragraphe 62 du rapport, la Cour supr\u00eame avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9 cette question : Thibodeau c. Air Canada, 2014 CSC 67, [2014] 3 R.C.S. 340. La Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que les recours en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour violation des droits linguistiques \u2014 droits fondamentaux quasi constitutionnels \u2014 \u00e0 bord d\u2019un a\u00e9ronef sont exclus en raison de la Convention de Varsovie, l\u2019instrument qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la Convention de Montr\u00e9al.\n[55] Aux paragraphes 64 et 65 du rapport, on approfondit cet aspect en se penchant sur le raisonnement de la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette conclusion. Cette derni\u00e8re avait examin\u00e9 une affaire dans laquelle un couple avait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 s\u2019\u00eatre fait refuser l\u2019embarquement \u00e0 bord d\u2019un vol en raison de sa race : King v. American Airlines, Inc., 284 F.3d 352 (2d Cir. 2002). Dans cette affaire, comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le couple b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait de la protection des lois qui pr\u00e9voient des mesures contre la discrimination raciale. La juge Sotomayor (maintenant juge \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame des \u00c9tats-Unis) a conclu que la demande relevait du champ d\u2019application de la Convention de Varsovie qui, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de la Convention de Montr\u00e9al, s\u2019applique de fa\u00e7on exhaustive aux recours pour pr\u00e9judice subi \u00ab au cours de [l\u2019une des] op\u00e9rations d\u2019embarquement \u00bb : Thibodeau, par. 68. La Cour supr\u00eame a souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019analyse faite dans l\u2019arr\u00eat King : Thibodeau, par. 67 \u00e0 73.\n[56] Compte tenu des arr\u00eats Thibodeau et King (qu\u2019a suivis la Cour supr\u00eame), ainsi que du libell\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis de la Convention de Montr\u00e9al et de la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien, on a conclu dans le rapport que la demande de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour atteinte aux droits de la personne pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait irrecevable.\n[57] La d\u00e9cision de la Commission de souscrire \u00e0 cette partie du rapport et au raisonnement qui y \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 est raisonnable. Le r\u00e9sultat est tout \u00e0 fait conforme \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision faisant autorit\u00e9 de la Cour supr\u00eame, ainsi qu\u2019au sens de la Convention de Montr\u00e9al et de la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien. En outre, il existe un raisonnement clair et suffisamment pr\u00e9cis menant des faits de l\u2019affaire au r\u00e9sultat.\n4) La Commission aurait-elle d\u00fb tenir compte de l\u2019article 6 de la Convention internationale sur l\u2019\u00e9limination de toutes les formes de discrimination raciale?\n[58] L\u2019appelant soutient que la Commission aurait d\u00fb tenir compte de l\u2019article 6 de la Convention internationale sur l\u2019\u00e9limination de toutes les formes de discrimination raciale.\n[59] Cette observation est sans fondement. Il \u00e9tait raisonnable de la part de la Commission de ne pas tenir compte de cette convention.\n[60] L\u2019appelant se m\u00e9prend quant \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation du droit international lorsque des organismes administratifs et des tribunaux tranchent des questions au Canada. Dans l\u2019un de ses arr\u00eats qui lie les d\u00e9cideurs administratifs et les tribunaux, la Cour supr\u00eame a bien \u00e9nonc\u00e9 le droit \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard : Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des auteurs, compositeurs et \u00e9diteurs de musique c. Entertainment Software Association, 2022 CSC 30, par. 43 \u00e0 48.\n[61] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le droit interne du Canada a int\u00e9gr\u00e9 \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation canadienne une convention internationale, soit la Convention de Montr\u00e9al, avec toutes les limites de responsabilit\u00e9 quant aux dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qui y sont pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019article 29. Dans une affaire comme celle en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, nous devons interpr\u00e9ter et mettre en \u0153uvre l\u2019article 29 : Bureau de l\u2019avocat des enfants c. Balev, 2018 CSC 16, [2018] 1 R.C.S. 398.\n[62] La Convention de Montr\u00e9al, qui fait maintenant partie du droit interne du Canada, avec les limites de responsabilit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qui sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 29, est claire et non \u00e9quivoque. Elle ne pr\u00e9voit pas d\u2019exceptions pour une \u00e9ventuelle responsabilit\u00e9, que ce soit au titre de normes et de principes du droit international, de revendications en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne ou d\u2019une autre responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant d\u2019autres instruments internationaux, par exemple la Convention internationale sur l\u2019\u00e9limination de toutes les formes de discrimination raciale. Et la Convention internationale sur l\u2019\u00e9limination de toutes les formes de discrimination raciale, lorsqu\u2019elle est bien lue et interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e, ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas de quelconque ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 dans l\u2019article 29 de la Convention de Montr\u00e9al. La Convention de Montr\u00e9al n\u2019est ni vague ni ambigu\u00eb. Il n\u2019existe en outre aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment extrins\u00e8que qui joue en faveur de l\u2019appelant. La Convention de Montr\u00e9al ferme toutes les issues. Elle ne laisse pas la moindre ouverture.\n[63] L\u2019appelant soutient que l\u2019article 6 de la Convention internationale sur l\u2019\u00e9limination de toutes les formes de discrimination raciale exige que le Canada assure une voie de recours sous forme de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour toute discrimination raciale dans le secteur de l\u2019aviation internationale, malgr\u00e9 la Convention de Montr\u00e9al et son int\u00e9gration dans le droit interne du Canada en vertu de la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien. Cependant, m\u00eame si l\u2019on suppose que l\u2019appelant a raison, notre Cour n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de rendre une ordonnance de mandamus enjoignant au Canada de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer pour se conformer \u00e0 cette exigence. Notre Cour ne peut pas non plus invoquer cette pr\u00e9tendue exigence \u2014 qui ne fait pas partie du droit interne \u2014 pour modifier, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019une autre, le libell\u00e9 clair de la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien et de la Convention de Montr\u00e9al.\n5) La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne l\u2019emporte-t-elle sur la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien?\n[64] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une nouvelle question, qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e devant la Commission. Mais il est possible de la trancher rapidement. Sur le plan de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois, la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien et l\u2019article 29 de la Convention de Montr\u00e9al sont clairs et d\u00e9pourvus d\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9. Ils interdisent tout recours en dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats, quelle qu\u2019en soit la forme. L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment se rapportant au texte, au contexte ou \u00e0 l\u2019objet qui donnerait \u00e0 penser que la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien et l\u2019article 29 de la Convention de Montr\u00e9al permettent, d\u2019une quelconque mani\u00e8re et malgr\u00e9 leur libell\u00e9 clair, des recours en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats fond\u00e9s sur des lois du Canada en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. En outre, l\u2019arr\u00eat Thibodeau de la Cour supr\u00eame tranche la question. Tout comme les droits linguistiques dans cette affaire ne l\u2019ont pas emport\u00e9 sur la Convention de Montr\u00e9al, il en va de m\u00eame en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce : voir les paragraphes 54 \u00e0 57 des pr\u00e9sents motifs.\n6) La Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien porte-t-elle atteinte aux droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 garantis par l\u2019article 15 de la Charte?\n[65] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus haut (au paragraphe 16), cette question faisait partie de la plainte de l\u2019appelant. La Commission n\u2019y a jamais donn\u00e9 suite. Pour achever sa t\u00e2che dans la pr\u00e9sente demande, la Commission doit examiner la question de savoir si, compte tenu des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et des observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, elle a comp\u00e9tence pour examiner cette question et, dans l\u2019affirmative, s\u2019il est \u00e9vident et manifeste que la plainte fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 15 de la Charte est \u00ab frivole \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 41 de la Loi \u2014 autrement dit, si la plainte a une quelconque chance d\u2019\u00eatre accueillie.\n[66] Au paragraphe 64 de ses motifs, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019offrir aux parties une autre possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des arguments concernant la plainte. La Commission devrait aussi offrir cette possibilit\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente question.\nD. La requ\u00eate r\u00e9cente\n[67] R\u00e9cemment, l\u2019appelant a sollicit\u00e9 une ordonnance exigeant la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un subpoena \u00e0 la Commission pour la contraindre \u00e0 produire certains documents dans une autre instance concernant Air Canada et une ordonnance l\u2019autorisant \u00e0 verser ces documents au dossier en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019appelant fait valoir que cette autre instance est essentiellement identique \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, mais que la Commission avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas rejeter la plainte. Toutefois, cette autre affaire a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un r\u00e8glement et ne sera pas entendue par le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne.\n[68] Air Canada note que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission ne fait aucune mention de la Convention de Montr\u00e9al ou de la Convention internationale sur l\u2019\u00e9limination de toutes les formes de discrimination raciale. Il y a lieu de souligner cette observation, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019Air Canada avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission que le plaignant ne serait pas en mesure d\u2019obtenir des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au motif de l\u2019application de la Convention de Montr\u00e9al.\n[69] Il semble plut\u00f4t que la Commission se soit prononc\u00e9e en tenant compte uniquement de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins qui ont comparu devant elle. La Commission avait peut-\u00eatre estim\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, que le Tribunal pouvait accorder des r\u00e9parations autres que des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats p\u00e9cuniaires. La Commission n\u2019offre aucune pr\u00e9cision \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[70] Par cons\u00e9quent, les documents que l\u2019appelant tente d\u2019obtenir ne semblent pr\u00e9senter aucune valeur probante dans l\u2019affaire qui nous occupe.\n[71] De plus, selon l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation la plus g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse qui soit, m\u00eame si la Commission avait dit quelque chose d\u2019utile \u00e0 l\u2019appelant \u2014 et apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance de la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate, je ne suis pas convaincu que ce soit le cas \u2014, il est bien \u00e9tabli que des d\u00e9cideurs saisis d\u2019affaires dont les faits sont tr\u00e8s semblables peuvent parvenir \u00e0 des r\u00e9sultats diff\u00e9rents, tous susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre raisonnables : Wilson c. \u00c9nergie Atomique du Canada Lt\u00e9e, 2016 CSC 29, [2016] 1 R.C.S. 770, par. 17.\n[72] En outre, le fait qu\u2019une deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision fasse \u00e9tat d\u2019un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent de celui de la premi\u00e8re ne prouve rien, m\u00eame si les deux d\u00e9cisions se rapportent \u00e0 des faits tr\u00e8s semblables. Il n\u2019est pas impossible que la deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision soit d\u00e9raisonnable. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, nous devons d\u00e9terminer si la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est raisonnable ou non. Je conclus qu\u2019elle est raisonnable. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne suis pas convaincu que l\u2019appelant a satisfait au crit\u00e8re relatif aux nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et, en particulier, \u00e0 l\u2019exigence selon laquelle les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve doivent \u00eatre susceptibles d\u2019influer sur le r\u00e9sultat : Barendregt c. Grebliunas, 2022 CSC 22; Palmer c. la Reine, [1980] 1 R.C.S. 759.\n[73] L\u2019appelant d\u00e9duit du fait que cette autre affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal que la Commission a certainement conclu qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de trancher des questions de droit au-del\u00e0 de sa loi habilitante, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 de pures conjectures. Mais si c\u2019\u00e9tait effectivement le cas, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission pourrait \u00eatre jug\u00e9e d\u00e9raisonnable selon l\u2019analyse dans les arr\u00eats Cooper et Martin, ainsi que dans les affaires ult\u00e9rieures, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es.\n[74] Enfin, j\u2019examine si l\u2019appelant a satisfait aux exigences relatives \u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un subpoena dans un contr\u00f4le judiciaire, et encore moins dans un appel : Tsleil\u2011Waututh Nation c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2017 CAF 128, par. 103.\n[75] En tout \u00e9tat de cause, peu importe ce que la Commission aurait pu faire dans une autre affaire, l\u2019analyse juridique expos\u00e9e plus haut demeure inchang\u00e9e. La d\u00e9cision de la Commission vis\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est raisonnable.\nE. L\u2019objection pr\u00e9liminaire d\u2019Air Canada\n[76] Air Canada fait valoir que l\u2019appelant a eu gain de cause devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et qu\u2019il porte simplement en appel les motifs de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Elle soutient, \u00e0 juste titre, que l\u2019on peut interjeter appel d\u2019un jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais pas des motifs de ce jugement : Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. (1985), ch. F-7, par. 27(1); Ratiopharm Inc. c. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 CAF 261, [2007] A.C.F. no 1019, par. 6; Fournier c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2019 CAF 265, par. 28.\n[77] Air Canada avait demand\u00e9, \u00e0 titre interlocutoire, l\u2019annulation de l\u2019appel, mais la Cour, sur le fondement du crit\u00e8re tr\u00e8s rigoureux qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019annulation des appels, a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate sans \u00e9teindre le droit d\u2019Air Canada de soulever cette question de nouveau \u00e0 l\u2019audience en appel.\n[78] \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019objection d\u2019Air Canada n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e.\n[79] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accueilli la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de l\u2019appelant, mais non sans apporter des pr\u00e9cisions. Elle a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la Commission \u00ab pour qu\u2019elle rende une nouvelle d\u00e9cision conform\u00e9ment aux pr\u00e9sents motifs de jugement \u00bb. Il ressort de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qu\u2019une seule question pr\u00e9cise de l\u2019appelant sera soumise \u00e0 un nouvel examen, soit celle expos\u00e9e au paragraphe 4 des pr\u00e9sents motifs. Toutes les autres mesures sollicit\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant, qui rev\u00eatent sans doute une bien plus grande importance \u00e0 ses yeux, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9es. L\u2019appelant a tout \u00e0 fait le droit d\u2019interjeter appel devant notre Cour pour demander l\u2019annulation de ce refus.\nF. Dispositif propos\u00e9\n[80] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je rejetterais la requ\u00eate avec d\u00e9pens.\n[81] J\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel en partie. En plus des questions que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a renvoy\u00e9es \u00e0 la Commission pour nouvelle d\u00e9cision, j\u2019ordonnerais \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019examiner la plainte de l\u2019appelant selon laquelle la mise en \u0153uvre de la Convention de Montr\u00e9al en vertu du paragraphe 2(2.1) de la Loi sur le transport a\u00e9rien viole les droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui lui sont garantis par l\u2019article 15 de la Charte.\n[82] Les deux parties ayant obtenu partiellement gain de cause dans le pr\u00e9sent appel, je n\u2019accorderais pas de d\u00e9pens \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de celui-ci.\n\u00ab David Stratas \u00bb\nj.c.a.\n\u00ab Je suis d\u2019accord.\nGeorge R.

En plus de la chef qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lue, les demanderesses Roberta Francis et Christine Mosquito ainsi que le d\u00e9fendeur Wesley Daniels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lus conseillers au sein du gouvernement de Nekaneet.\n[2] En vertu de la Nekaneet Constitution (la Constitution de Nekaneet) et de la Nekaneet Governance Act (la Loi sur la gouvernance de Nekaneet), le tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet serait habituellement l\u2019instance habilit\u00e9e \u00e0 trancher un tel appel. Cependant, le mandat des trois membres de ce tribunal avait expir\u00e9. Mme Buffalocalf a insist\u00e9 pour que les si\u00e8ges vacants soient [traduction] \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement \u00bb pourvus. Peu apr\u00e8s, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der autrement. Le 26 avril 2023, s\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019article 8.07 de la Constitution de Nekaneet, elle a remis aux conseill\u00e8res Roberta Francis et Christine Mosquito une d\u00e9claration pronon\u00e7ant la destitution du gouvernement de Nekaneet et d\u00e9clenchant une nouvelle \u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (la d\u00e9claration). Deux jours plus tard, la chef et le conseil ont nomm\u00e9 les trois membres du tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet et ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et une requ\u00eate en injonction provisoire.\n[3] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (le juge Grammond) a accord\u00e9 l\u2019injonction provisoire (Premi\u00e8re Nation de Nekaneet c. Louison, 2023 CF 709) et a finalement conclu que la d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable au motif qu\u2019elle reposait sur une interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e de la Constitution de Nekaneet : Premi\u00e8re Nation de Nekaneet c. Louison, 2023 CF 897. Nous sommes saisis de l\u2019appel de cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cision. Dans le dossier A-193-23, Mme Buffalocalf interjette appel de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur le fond, alors que, dans le dossier A-276-23, la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Nekaneet et les appelantes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es, ainsi que Mme Buffalocalf en tant qu\u2019appelante incidente, contestent l\u2019adjudication des d\u00e9pens, qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision distincte de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[4] Dans l\u2019appel sur le fond, Mme Buffalocalf a soulev\u00e9 plusieurs questions sur le contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable auquel a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 le juge saisi de la demande, notamment sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Constitution de Nekaneet, et plus particuli\u00e8rement sur le d\u00e9lai de nomination des nouveaux membres du tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du mandat de leurs pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs. Cependant, je suis d\u2019avis que nous ne devons pas, et ne pouvons pas, examiner ces questions, car ni la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ni notre Cour n\u2019ont comp\u00e9tence sur le fondement du litige entre les parties.\nI. FAITS ET D\u00c9CISION DE L\u2019INSTANCE INF\u00c9RIEURE [5] Comme je le mentionne ci-dessus, les intim\u00e9es, la chef Wahobin et les conseill\u00e8res Francis et Mosquito, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lues au sein du gouvernement de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Nekaneet le 29 mars 2023. L\u2019appelante, Mme Buffalocalf, a occup\u00e9 le poste de conseill\u00e8re de 2017 \u00e0 2023, mais n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9\u00e9lue \u00e0 ce poste.\n[6] En vertu des articles 5.04, 19.01 et 19.10 de la Loi sur la gouvernance de Nekaneet, le candidat non \u00e9lu a le droit d\u2019interjeter appel de l\u2019\u00e9lection d\u2019un candidat dans les 30 jours suivant son \u00e9lection si ce candidat \u00e9lu n\u2019a pas satisfait aux conditions d\u2019\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues par cette loi. La demande doit \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet, dont la composition et les pouvoirs sont r\u00e9gis par l\u2019article 8 de la Constitution de Nekaneet. Ce tribunal est toujours cens\u00e9 \u00eatre form\u00e9 d\u2019au moins trois membres qui exercent des mandats \u00e9chelonn\u00e9s. Il ressort du dossier que le tribunal d\u2019appel ne si\u00e9geait pas entre 2017 et le 3 mars 2020, date \u00e0 laquelle trois membres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s en m\u00eame temps. Le mandat de ces derniers expirait le 2 mars 2023.\n[7] Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Buffalocalf a demand\u00e9 si les membres du tribunal d\u2019appel avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s et, si non, a exig\u00e9 que la chef et le conseil proc\u00e8dent aux nominations au plus tard le 21 avril 2023. \u00c0 d\u00e9faut, elle recueillerait des signatures \u00e0 l\u2019appui d\u2019une d\u00e9claration qui d\u00e9clencherait une nouvelle \u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale le 2 juin 2023. Je reproduis int\u00e9gralement l\u2019article 8.07 de la Constitution de Nekaneet sur lequel s\u2019appuie Mme Buffalocalf, puisqu\u2019il est essentiel \u00e0 la compr\u00e9hension du pr\u00e9sent appel :\n[traduction]\n8.07 Dans le cas o\u00f9 le gouvernement de Nekaneet omettrait de nommer les membres du tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet ou de pourvoir les postes vacants conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Constitution ou aux lois de Nekaneet, de telle sorte qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait plus de tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet, le gouvernement de Nekaneet cesse d\u2019exercer ses fonctions \u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle une d\u00e9claration est sign\u00e9e par au moins 35 pour 100 des \u00e9lecteurs de Nekaneet et \u00e9nonce ce qui suit :\na) le gouvernement de Nekaneet a viol\u00e9 la Constitution de Nekaneet ou une loi de Nekaneet en omettant de nommer les membres du tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet et le gouvernement de Nekaneet doit par cons\u00e9quent cesser ses fonctions;\nb) une \u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est d\u00e9clench\u00e9e;\nc) la date de l\u2019\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la date de l\u2019assembl\u00e9e de mise en candidature et la nomination du pr\u00e9sident d\u2019\u00e9lection et du pr\u00e9sident d\u2019\u00e9lection adjoint en vue de l\u2019\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale;\nDans un tel cas, le gouvernement de Nekaneet en poste cesse ses fonctions \u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle la d\u00e9claration ou une copie de celle\u2011ci est remise au chef qui \u00e9tait en poste ou \u00e0 au moins deux des conseillers qui \u00e9taient en poste, et une \u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est tenue sous la direction du pr\u00e9sident d\u2019\u00e9lection qui poss\u00e8de les pouvoirs n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la tenue d\u2019une \u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale; les honoraires et les frais associ\u00e9s \u00e0 cette \u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sont \u00e0 la charge de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Nekaneet.\n[8] Comme le gouvernement n\u2019avait nomm\u00e9 aucun membre du tribunal d\u2019appel au 21 avril 2023, Mme Buffalocalf a recueilli 148 signatures (environ 38 % des \u00e9lecteurs admissibles) et a remis la d\u00e9claration le 26 avril 2023 aux conseill\u00e8res Francis et Mosquito (la chef Wahobin \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du pays pour participer \u00e0 une r\u00e9union du Conseil tribal). Peu apr\u00e8s, le 28 avril 2023, la chef et le conseil ont pourvu les trois postes vacants du tribunal d\u2019appel et ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9claration aupr\u00e8s de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[9] Le d\u00e9lai de nomination des membres du tribunal d\u2019appel est au c\u0153ur du litige concernant le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la d\u00e9claration. Les arguments des parties dans le pr\u00e9sent litige portent sur le libell\u00e9 des divers alin\u00e9as de l\u2019article 8. Mme Buffalocalf invoque l\u2019article 8.01, aux termes duquel le gouvernement de Nekaneet nomme [traduction] \u00ab sans d\u00e9lai \u00bb les membres du tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet et pourvoit les postes vacants [traduction] \u00ab en temps opportun \u00bb. La chef et le conseil, pour leur part, estiment plut\u00f4t que le d\u00e9lai pour pourvoir les postes vacants est de 60 jours.\n[10] \u00c0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le juge Grammond a tranch\u00e9 en faveur de la chef et du conseil et a conclu que les expressions [traduction] \u00ab sans d\u00e9lai \u00bb et [traduction] \u00ab en temps opportun \u00bb figurant \u00e0 l\u2019article 8.01, lues dans leur contexte, doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es comme signifiant dans les 60 jours. Pour tirer cette conclusion, le juge saisi de la demande s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur les articles 8.04 (les membres du premier tribunal d\u2019appel [traduction] \u00ab doivent \u00eatre nomm\u00e9s au plus tard soixante (60) jours apr\u00e8s la date de l\u2019\u00e9lection de Nekaneet de 2008 \u00bb) et 8.05 (le poste devenu vacant par suite de la destitution, du d\u00e9c\u00e8s ou de la d\u00e9mission d\u2019un membre [traduction] \u00ab doit \u00eatre pourvu par le gouvernement dans les soixante (60) jours suivant cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement \u00bb). Bien qu\u2019il ait reconnu que ces deux articles ne fussent pas applicables \u00e0 l\u2019affaire dont il \u00e9tait saisi, le juge Grammond a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait \u00e9trange d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019expression \u00ab en temps opportun \u00bb de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 donner des r\u00e9sultats diff\u00e9rents selon le type de poste vacant. Comme il l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, \u00ab [i]l faudrait que l\u2019article 8.01 soit formul\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on beaucoup plus pr\u00e9cise pour qu\u2019il soit raisonnable de conclure que l\u2019expression \u201cen temps opportun\u201d signifie 60 jours dans certains cas, mais que dans d\u2019autres cas sa port\u00e9e soit laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des auteurs d\u2019une d\u00e9claration \u00bb (par. 25 de ses motifs). Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que la d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait invalide, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas raisonnable de faire fi du d\u00e9lai de nomination de 60 jours.\n[11] Dans des motifs distincts, le juge Grammond a adjug\u00e9 des d\u00e9pens de 5 000 $ aux d\u00e9fendeurs. Ainsi, il a rejet\u00e9 leur requ\u00eate en d\u00e9pens major\u00e9s ainsi que les requ\u00eates des deux parties pour que les d\u00e9pens soient pay\u00e9s par la Premi\u00e8re Nation.\nII. QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [12] Comme je l\u2019indique plus haut, Mme Buffalocalf a soulev\u00e9 plusieurs questions concernant le bien-fond\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. D\u2019abord et avant tout, elle conteste l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019article 8.01. Selon elle, il existe deux types de nomination assortis de d\u00e9lais diff\u00e9rents. En 2008, les membres du premier tribunal devaient \u00eatre nomm\u00e9s dans les 60 jours, alors que les nominations subs\u00e9quentes doivent \u00eatre faites [traduction] \u00ab en temps opportun \u00bb. Pourvoir les postes vacants et nommer les membres du tribunal sont deux types de nomination diff\u00e9rents, le premier ayant lieu au milieu du mandat et le second, au d\u00e9but du mandat. M\u00eame si l\u2019on supposait que nommer de nouveaux membres apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du mandat des pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs revient \u00e0 pourvoir des postes vacants pour l\u2019application de l\u2019article 8.01, ce que l\u2019appelante conteste, le remplacement devrait se faire [traduction] \u00ab en temps opportun \u00bb, et non [traduction] \u00ab dans les soixante (60) jours \u00bb, puisque les nominations effectu\u00e9es par suite de l\u2019expiration du mandat d\u2019un pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur ne d\u00e9coulent pas de cas [traduction] \u00ab de destitution, de d\u00e9c\u00e8s ou de d\u00e9mission d\u2019un membre \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 8.05. Le terme [traduction] \u00ab destitution \u00bb tel qu\u2019il est utilis\u00e9 dans cet article suppose un renvoi par le gouvernement. D\u2019ailleurs, les r\u00e9dacteurs auraient ajout\u00e9 les mots [traduction] \u00ab expiration du mandat \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019article 8.05 s\u2019ils avaient voulu que le d\u00e9lai de 60 jours s\u2019applique \u00e0 cette situation, puisqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient manifestement au courant d\u2019un tel sc\u00e9nario, comme le d\u00e9montre l\u2019article 8.06.\n[13] Mme Buffalocalf fait \u00e9galement valoir que le juge saisi de la demande a commis une erreur en appliquant, en fait, la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte sous le couvert d\u2019un contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, elle soutient que le juge Grammond n\u2019a pas tenu compte des principes de retenue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9cideurs autochtones, de sorte qu\u2019il a fait abstraction non seulement de principes de common law, mais \u00e9galement de l\u2019adoption par le l\u00e9gislateur de la Loi sur la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones, L.C. 2021, ch. 14.\n[14] Pour les motifs que j\u2019expose ci-dessous dans mon analyse, je ne me penche pas sur ces arguments. Les seules questions \u00e0 trancher sont les suivantes :\n1)Notre Cour (et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale) a-t-elle comp\u00e9tence pour contr\u00f4ler la d\u00e9claration et conna\u00eetre de la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9es dans le dossier A-193-23?\n2)La demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire dans le dossier A-193-23 \u00e9tait-elle pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e?\n3)La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a-t-elle commis une erreur de droit ou une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante dans l\u2019adjudication des d\u00e9pens?\nIII. ANALYSE 1) La comp\u00e9tence des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales sur les litiges et les questions \u00e9lectorales touchant les Premi\u00e8res Nations [15] En tant que cours cr\u00e9\u00e9es par une loi en vertu de l\u2019article 101 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867, 30 & 31 Vict., ch. 3 (R.-U.), reproduite dans L.R.C. (1985), appendice II (la Loi constitutionnelle), il est bien \u00e9tabli que la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et de notre Cour se limite \u00e0 celle que lui conf\u00e8re la loi. De plus, cette comp\u00e9tence doit \u00eatre li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019application d\u2019une loi du Canada au sens de l\u2019article 101 de la Loi constitutionnelle : voir, entre autres, ITO-Int\u2019l Terminal Operators c. Miida Electronics, [1986] 1 R.C.S. 752; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. TeleZone Inc., 2010 CSC 62; Windsor (City) c. Canadian Transit Co., 2016 CSC 54 (Windsor). Les articles 18 et 28 de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. (1985), ch. F-7 (la LCF), imposent \u00e9galement une limite \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence exclusive des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales pour conna\u00eetre des demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. En effet, le contr\u00f4le demand\u00e9 doit viser les d\u00e9cisions d\u2019un \u00ab office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb au sens du paragraphe 2(1) de la LCF, \u00e0 savoir tout \u00ab [c]onseil, bureau, commission ou autre organisme, ou personne ou groupe de personnes, ayant, exer\u00e7ant ou cens\u00e9 exercer une comp\u00e9tence ou des pouvoirs pr\u00e9vus par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb.\n[16] Dans leurs observations initiales devant notre Cour, les deux parties semblent tenir pour acquis que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et notre Cour ont comp\u00e9tence pour conna\u00eetre de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9es. L\u2019appelante, surtout, soutient que les signataires de la d\u00e9claration avaient le pouvoir, en vertu de l\u2019article 8.07 de la Constitution de Nekaneet, de prendre la d\u00e9cision collective de signer et de remettre la d\u00e9claration et qu\u2019ils sont donc un \u00ab office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb lorsqu\u2019ils exercent ce pouvoir. Quant aux intim\u00e9es, elles semblent \u00eatre du m\u00eame avis. Bien qu\u2019elles ne traitent pas express\u00e9ment de la question de la comp\u00e9tence dans leur m\u00e9moire initial, elles ont soulign\u00e9 au paragraphe 31 de leur avis de demande qu\u2019un \u00ab office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb s\u2019entend d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019un groupe de personnes \u00ab cens\u00e9 \u00bb exercer une comp\u00e9tence ou des pouvoirs pr\u00e9vus par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et que, par cons\u00e9quent, la d\u00e9claration avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e par un tel groupe de personnes. Elles se sont \u00e9galement appuy\u00e9es sur le fait que la pr\u00e9sidente d\u2019\u00e9lection que la d\u00e9claration vise \u00e0 nommer pour la tenue d\u2019une \u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est un \u00ab office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb en soi.\n[17] Comme aucune des parties (ni la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, d\u2019ailleurs) n\u2019a trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante de la question de la comp\u00e9tence, notre Cour a \u00e9mis une directive le 9 mai 2024 pour demander des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires sur les deux questions suivantes : 1) celle de savoir si la situation factuelle \u00e0 l\u2019origine du contr\u00f4le judiciaire rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle suppose l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir par un \u00ab office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb; et 2) celle de savoir si l\u2019esp\u00e8ce concerne une \u00ab d\u00e9cision \u00bb ou un \u00ab objet \u00bb qui peut \u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire pour l\u2019application des paragraphes 18.1(1) et (3) de la LCF. Les parties se sont d\u00fbment pli\u00e9es \u00e0 la directive et ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites concernant ces deux questions, dont je traite ci-apr\u00e8s.\n[18] Il existe trois voies principales par lesquelles les aux Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales fondent leur comp\u00e9tence sur les questions \u00e9lectorales touchant les Premi\u00e8res Nations : a) le conseil de bande qui agit \u00e0 titre d\u2019office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral; b) le pouvoir de contr\u00f4le sur les \u00e9lections d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation; et c) le bref de quo warranto.\n[19] Le conseil de bande constitu\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C. (1985), ch. I-5, est un \u00ab office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb dont les d\u00e9cisions sont susceptibles de contr\u00f4le judiciaire lorsqu\u2019il exerce ses pouvoirs sur les membres de la bande en vertu d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale : Premi\u00e8re nation Saugeen no 29 c. Sebastian, 2003 CAF 28, par. 51; Sioui c. Conseil de la Nation Huronne-Wendat, 2023 CF 1731, par. 30. Selon la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab conseil de la bande \u00bb figurant au paragraphe 2(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens, un conseil de bande n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement constitu\u00e9 au moyen d\u2019une \u00e9lection tenue conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure particuli\u00e8re pr\u00e9vue par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (p. ex. le paragraphe 74(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens) ou par la Loi sur les \u00e9lections au sein de premi\u00e8res nations, L.C. 2014, ch. 5. Il peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre constitu\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la coutume non \u00e9crite de la bande ou \u00e0 son propre code \u00e9lectoral, comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce : Ratt c. Matchewan, 2010 CF 160, par. 104 \u00e0 106 (Ratt).\n[20] Lorsque les conseils de bande sont constitu\u00e9s selon la coutume, les pouvoirs exerc\u00e9s par les Premi\u00e8res Nations relativement \u00e0 la s\u00e9lection de leurs dirigeants sont int\u00e9gr\u00e9s par renvoi dans la Loi sur les Indiens. Ils sont donc pr\u00e9vus par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et exerc\u00e9s par un \u00ab office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb : Canatonquin c. Gabriel, [1980] 2 C.F. 729 (CAF), 1980 CanLII 4125; Premi\u00e8re Nation d\u2019Ermineskin c. Minde, 2008 CAF 52, par. 33 (Minde); Bellegarde c. Premi\u00e8re Nation de Carry the Kettle, 2024 CF 699, par. 50 \u00e0 52 (Bellegarde).\n[21] Dans les cas o\u00f9 les pouvoirs exerc\u00e9s par les conseils de bande sont d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019autres organismes d\u00e9cisionnels, mandataires ou personnes, l\u2019exercice de ces pouvoirs demeure vis\u00e9 par l\u2019article 18.1 de la LCF. Par exemple, les d\u00e9cisions d\u2019expulsion rendues par une r\u00e9gie du logement qui agit en tant que mandataire de la Premi\u00e8re Nation sont susceptibles de contr\u00f4le au titre de l\u2019article 18.1. Un conseil \u00e9lectoral qui examine des appels et des plaintes concernant les \u00e9lections est \u00e9galement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un \u00ab office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb, pourvu que ses pouvoirs d\u00e9coulent d\u2019une loi appliqu\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens. De m\u00eame, la d\u00e9cision d\u2019un conseil des anciens portant qu\u2019un repr\u00e9sentant \u00e9lu a \u00ab quitt\u00e9 \u00bb son poste est vis\u00e9e par l\u2019article 18 de la LCF, car le conseil des anciens \u00e9tait habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 rendre cette d\u00e9cision conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Constitution de la bande : voir Cyr c. Premi\u00e8re Nation Ojibway de Batchewana, 2022 CAF 90, par. 44; Nation Crie Opaskwayak c. Cook, 2023 CF 505, par. 30; Minde, par. 33; Bellegarde, par. 29 et la jurisprudence cit\u00e9e.\n[22] Il existe \u00e9galement un deuxi\u00e8me courant jurisprudentiel voulant que les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales aient un pouvoir de contr\u00f4le sur les \u00e9lections au sein des bandes lorsqu\u2019elles se tiennent selon leurs coutumes. Ce pouvoir s\u2019\u00e9tend aux d\u00e9cisions rendues par les tribunaux d\u2019appel \u00e9lectoraux : voir Minde; Francis c. Conseil mohawk de Kanesatake, [2003] 4 C.F. 1133, par. 11 \u00e0 18; Premi\u00e8re nation de Grand Rapids c. Nasikapow, [2000] A.C.F. no 1896, par. 5 et 6; Ratt, par. 96 \u00e0 100. Ce type de pouvoir a m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9largi de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9galement viser les d\u00e9cisions qui sont \u00ab intimement li\u00e9es \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9lectorale \u00bb, par exemple lorsqu\u2019un agent \u00e9lectoral retire le nom d\u2019un candidat du bulletin de vote, lorsque le conseil d\u00e9cide de ne prendre aucune autre mesure apr\u00e8s que l\u2019organisme d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour r\u00e9gler le diff\u00e9rend a refus\u00e9 d\u2019intervenir et lorsque le chef refuse de d\u00e9missionner : voir Thomas c. Premi\u00e8re Nation One Arrow, 2019 CF 1663, par. 13 et 14.\n[23] Le pouvoir d\u2019examiner les litiges o\u00f9 aucune d\u00e9cision n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par un \u00ab office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb, mais o\u00f9 une demande de bref de pr\u00e9rogative de quo warranto a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e est \u00e9galement li\u00e9 au pouvoir de contr\u00f4le des Cours sur les \u00e9lections au sein des bandes. Il s\u2019agit de la troisi\u00e8me voie permettant de fonder la comp\u00e9tence des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales sur les questions \u00e9lectorales touchant les Premi\u00e8res Nations. Le bref de quo warranto est un recours applicable lorsque la contestation vise le droit du titulaire d\u2019une charge publique d\u2019exercer cette charge ou le pouvoir en vertu duquel une personne d\u00e9clare agir : voir Nation Ojibw\u00e9e de Saugeen c. Derose, 2022 CF 531, par. 26; Marie c. Wanderingspirit, 2003 CAF 385, par. 20 (Wanderingspirit); Premi\u00e8re Nation de Key c. Lavall\u00e9e, 2021 CAF 123, par. 59; Bande indienne de Lake Babine c. Williams, [1996] A.C.F. no 173, par. 3 et 4; Standingready c. Premi\u00e8re Nation Ocean Man, 2021 CF 434, par. 13. L\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9e doit concerner l\u2019\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne \u00e0 une charge ou le processus \u00e9lectoral lui-m\u00eame. Le recours ne s\u2019\u00e9tend pas aux cas d\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9s all\u00e9gu\u00e9es qui ne sont pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne et il n\u2019est pas un outil pour l\u2019expression de dol\u00e9ances politiques. On ne peut se pr\u00e9valoir de ce recours pour affirmer que les titulaires de charge ont pris des d\u00e9cisions imprudentes ou ont abus\u00e9 des pouvoirs qui leur \u00e9taient conf\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n[24] L\u2019affaire qui nous occupe ne cadre pas vraiment avec l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des trois fondements permettant aux Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales de revendiquer leur comp\u00e9tence.\n[25] Dans leurs observations suppl\u00e9mentaires d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la directive de notre Cour dat\u00e9e du 9 mai 2024, l\u2019appelante et les intim\u00e9es s\u2019appuient largement sur le raisonnement qu\u2019a expos\u00e9 le juge Grammond dans son ordonnance accordant l\u2019injonction provisoire. Il est int\u00e9ressant de remarquer que l\u2019appelante avait soutenu devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale que cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire des intim\u00e9es et qu\u2019elle ne pouvait donc pas accorder l\u2019injonction provisoire demand\u00e9e. Le juge Grammond a rejet\u00e9 cet argument dans son ordonnance accordant l\u2019injonction provisoire :\n[15] Mme Buffalocalf s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour. Elle affirme que, contrairement aux faits dans l\u2019affaire Bellegarde, les demanderesses en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne contestent pas une d\u00e9cision rendue par un \u00ab office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb, mais plut\u00f4t une d\u00e9cision prise par les \u00e9lecteurs de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Nekaneet. \u00c0 mon avis, cela ne fait pas de diff\u00e9rence. Il ne fait aucun doute que notre Cour peut proc\u00e9der au contr\u00f4le des d\u00e9cisions prises par les \u00e9lecteurs d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation lorsqu\u2019ils pr\u00e9tendent exercer un pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par une loi \u00e9lectorale de la Premi\u00e8re Nation : voir, par exemple, Marie c Wanderingspirit, 2003 CAF 385; Oakes c Pahtayken, 2010 CAF 169; Narte c Gladstone, 2021 CF 433.\n[26] Je suis d\u2019avis que le paragraphe cit\u00e9 ci-dessus et les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s devant nous par les parties confondent les diverses comp\u00e9tences des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales en ce qui a trait aux \u00e9lections au sein des bandes et brouillent la ligne entre ce qui constitue respectivement une question \u00e9lectorale et une question de gouvernance. En effet, il faut garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que l\u2019article 8 de la Constitution de Nekaneet ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une loi \u00e9lectorale. Il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t d\u2019une disposition qui \u00e9tablit le tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet, les r\u00e8gles de nomination de ses membres et sa comp\u00e9tence. Advenant que le tribunal ne soit pas d\u00fbment constitu\u00e9, l\u2019article 8.07 pr\u00e9voit un m\u00e9canisme automatique et d\u00e9mocratique permettant de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 cette violation de la Constitution de Nekaneet. Certes, le processus mis en place comprend un vote, la destitution du gouvernement de Nekaneet et l\u2019\u00e9lection d\u2019un nouveau gouvernement. Toutefois, l\u2019article 8.07 ne peut \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une loi \u00e9lectorale, comme c\u2019est le cas dans les d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es par le juge Grammond dans le paragraphe reproduit ci-dessus. Une br\u00e8ve analyse de ces d\u00e9cisions le d\u00e9montre.\n[27] L\u2019affaire Wanderingspirit concernait une r\u00e9union de la bande tenue pour voter la destitution de certains conseillers \u00e9lus et, par la m\u00eame occasion, \u00e9lire les nouveaux conseillers qui allaient les remplacer. Aucun avis n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 aux membres de la bande avant la r\u00e9union pour les informer que cette \u00e9lection aurait lieu. Le groupe destitu\u00e9 avait sollicit\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire du vote de destitution les visant et de l\u2019\u00e9lection des nouveaux conseillers. La Section de premi\u00e8re instance avait accueilli la demande et conclu que les deux votes \u00e9taient nuls.\n[28] En appel, les appelants ont soutenu que la [traduction] \u00ab volont\u00e9 du peuple \u00bb devait \u00eatre respect\u00e9e dans le choix des repr\u00e9sentants \u00e9lus. Notre Cour a souscrit \u00e0 cette affirmation, mais en pr\u00e9cisant que la [traduction] \u00ab volont\u00e9 du peuple \u00bb devait respecter la coutume \u00e9lectorale de la bande et la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tablie. Le vote tenu lors de la r\u00e9union n\u2019\u00e9tait pas conforme aux coutumes \u00e9lectorales de la Premi\u00e8re Nation et ne respectait pas les principes de justice naturelle, puisqu\u2019aucun avis n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9.\n[29] Il est int\u00e9ressant de souligner que notre Cour a reconnu qu\u2019aucune \u00ab d\u00e9cision \u00bb n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise. Cependant, une telle d\u00e9cision n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire dans les circonstances, car c\u2019\u00e9tait le pouvoir des conseillers nouvellement \u00e9lus d\u2019exercer les fonctions du groupe destitu\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait contest\u00e9. Notre Cour s\u2019est donc appuy\u00e9e sur sa comp\u00e9tence lui permettant de d\u00e9livrer un bref de quo warranto : \u00ab [m]\u00eame si, par leur demande, ils souhaitaient obtenir un jugement d\u00e9claratoire et non express\u00e9ment un bref de quo warranto, les intim\u00e9s ont, au fond, demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de rendre un jugement d\u00e9claratoire \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 un bref de pr\u00e9rogative de quo warranto \u00bb (par. 17). Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour avait comp\u00e9tence en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 18(1)a) de la LCF. Comme je l\u2019indique plus haut, notre Cour a soulign\u00e9 que le bref de quo warranto est une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle habituelle selon laquelle le contr\u00f4le judiciaire concerne une d\u00e9cision prise par un office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral (par. 20).\n[30] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce bref r\u00e9sum\u00e9, il est facile de comprendre les grandes diff\u00e9rences qui existent entre l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et l\u2019affaire Wanderingspirit. La demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire visant la d\u00e9claration et d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le conseil et la chef nouvellement \u00e9lus ne constitue pas une contestation du droit du titulaire d\u2019une charge publique d\u2019exercer cette charge, de sorte qu\u2019elle ne peut \u00eatre assimil\u00e9e \u00e0 une demande de bref de quo warranto. Il est vrai que la personne nomm\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de pr\u00e9sidente d\u2019\u00e9lection est mentionn\u00e9e dans l\u2019avis de demande, mais l\u2019issue ne reposait en rien sur cette nomination, et ni l\u2019appelante ni les intim\u00e9es n\u2019ont fait grand cas de cette nomination ou n\u2019ont v\u00e9ritablement analys\u00e9 sa position.\n[31] La propre conduite de l\u2019appelante confirme cette interpr\u00e9tation de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Le 17 avril 2023, elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande devant le tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet en vue d\u2019obtenir diverses r\u00e9parations, dont un jugement d\u00e9clarant l\u2019intim\u00e9e Carolyn Wahobin in\u00e9ligible comme candidate au poste de chef, contestant ainsi son \u00e9lection. L\u2019appelante semblait comprendre que la seule mani\u00e8re de contester l\u2019\u00e9lection de la chef \u00e9tait le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une demande devant le tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet. Comme le tribunal n\u2019avait pas d\u00fbment \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9lai de 30 jours pr\u00e9vu pour contester l\u2019\u00e9lection, Mme Buffalocalf a eu recours au m\u00e9canisme constitutionnel qu\u2019est la d\u00e9claration. Il importe de souligner, cependant, que la d\u00e9claration produit automatiquement ses effets une fois sign\u00e9e par au moins 35 p. 100 des \u00e9lecteurs admissibles. Elle ne repose pas sur une contestation du droit du titulaire d\u2019une charge publique d\u2019exercer cette charge, mais plut\u00f4t sur l\u2019id\u00e9e que les membres du gouvernement de Nekaneet \u00e9taient \u00e9ligibles \u00e0 exercer une charge, mais avaient viol\u00e9 la Constitution de Nekaneet en ne nommant pas les membres du tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet ou en ne pourvoyant pas les postes vacants. La contestation d\u2019une d\u00e9claration ne s\u2019apparente donc pas \u00e0 une demande de bref de quo warranto.\n[32] Certaines des observations formul\u00e9es par la chef et le conseil \u00e0 titre d\u2019appelants dans l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9pens renforcent \u00e9galement mon analyse quant au fond. Ils ont reconnu que l\u2019objet de la d\u00e9claration pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 8.07 est de produire ses effets uniquement s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet. Contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils ont affirm\u00e9 dans leurs observations formul\u00e9es dans l\u2019appel sur le fond, ils soutiennent \u00e9galement qu\u2019une seule d\u00e9cision fait l\u2019objet de l\u2019appel : la d\u00e9claration. Enfin, fait important pour la question de la comp\u00e9tence, ils font valoir que l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 contre l\u2019\u00e9lection et la d\u00e9claration sont distincts l\u2019un de l\u2019autre.\n[33] Malheureusement, le juge saisi de la demande a pass\u00e9 sous silence cette diff\u00e9rence fondamentale entre ce qui s\u2019est produit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et les caract\u00e9ristiques essentielles du bref de quo warranto. Il est sans doute vrai que l\u2019appelante a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 recueillir des signatures afin d\u2019obtenir la d\u00e9claration peu apr\u00e8s la tenue de l\u2019\u00e9lection et que cette d\u00e9claration a eu pour effet d\u2019annuler les r\u00e9sultats de cette \u00e9lection. Cependant, il n\u2019en demeure pas moins que la d\u00e9claration n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une contestation directe de l\u2019\u00e9lection et qu\u2019elle constituait une \u00e9tape ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle-ci. M\u00eame si l\u2019on souhaitait interpr\u00e9ter une demande en fonction de son fondement sous-jacent, les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales doivent se garder d\u2019outrepasser leur comp\u00e9tence.\n[34] Les d\u00e9cisions Pahtayken c. Oakes, 2009 CF 134 (Pahtayken), et Narte c. Gladstone, 2021 CF 433 (Narte), illustrent \u00e9galement cette confusion conceptuelle. La premi\u00e8re affaire porte sur la pr\u00e9sentation par la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Nekaneet de deux \u00e9quipes de chef et de conseillers. Il \u00e9tait donc n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer qui \u00e9tait l\u00e9galement en poste. Les demanderesses avaient tenu un r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum pour adopter la Constitution de Nekaneet et la Loi sur la gouvernance de Nekaneet, puis avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lues conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9lectorale pr\u00e9vue dans ces deux documents constitutifs. Les d\u00e9fendeurs, quant \u00e0 eux, avaient boycott\u00e9 le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum et avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lus conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la coutume pr\u00e9existante de la bande. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que les demanderesses avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement \u00e9lues, puisque le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum tenu en vue d\u2019adopter les documents constitutifs traduisait un consensus \u00ab suffisant \u00bb : Pahtayken, par. 66. Notre Cour a confirm\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale : Oakes c. Pahtayken, 2010 CAF 169. Bien que notre Cour n\u2019ait pas trait\u00e9 de la question de la comp\u00e9tence, il est int\u00e9ressant de souligner qu\u2019en premi\u00e8re instance, les demandeurs avaient sollicit\u00e9 un bref de quo warranto en vertu du paragraphe 18(1) de la LCF. L\u00e0 encore, la situation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019est pas la m\u00eame.\n[35] Enfin, dans la d\u00e9cision Narte, les demandeurs sollicitaient la destitution de membres du conseil d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation, car ces derniers n\u2019avaient pas divulgu\u00e9 des renseignements financiers et n\u2019avaient pas fourni les r\u00e9sultats de tests de d\u00e9pistage de drogue. Ils ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de rendre une ordonnance destituant les conseillers et d\u00e9clenchant une nouvelle \u00e9lection. L\u00e0 encore, comme l\u2019a fait remarquer le juge Grammond dans sa d\u00e9cision, les demandeurs sollicitaient un jugement d\u00e9claratoire et un bref de quo warranto \u00ab ayant pour effet de destituer \u00bb les conseillers du conseil de la bande. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de la r\u00e9paration que les intim\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont demand\u00e9e devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[36] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, je suis d\u2019avis que ni notre Cour ni la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne peuvent revendiquer comp\u00e9tence sur la pr\u00e9sente affaire en vertu du paragraphe 18(1) de la LCF au motif qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une demande de quo warranto. Peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 la demande des intim\u00e9es (les demanderesses en premi\u00e8re instance), qui cherchaient clairement \u00e0 fonder leur demande sur la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de d\u00e9livrer un bref de quo warranto, le juge Grammond a tenu pour acquis qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une affaire portant sur la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une \u00e9lection. Bien qu\u2019il avait certainement le droit de lire les documents dont il disposait pour en saisir le v\u00e9ritable contenu, il a n\u00e9anmoins d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la seule d\u00e9cision faisant l\u2019objet du contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e9tait la d\u00e9claration. Comme je le mentionne plus haut, cette d\u00e9claration est un m\u00e9canisme constitutionnel visant \u00e0 r\u00e9parer une violation constitutionnelle. Cette violation constitutionnelle \u2013 omettre de nommer les membres du tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet \u2013 n\u2019est pas directement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une \u00e9lection, m\u00eame si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise dans un contexte \u00e9lectoral. En effet, les intim\u00e9es ont explicitement reconnu que l\u2019objet de l\u2019article 8.07 n\u2019est [traduction] \u00ab pas de d\u00e9mettre ou de destituer [les \u00e9lus] ni d\u2019annuler le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une \u00e9lection \u00bb (par. 74 de leur m\u00e9moire).\n[37] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je ne vois pas comment notre Cour (ni la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale) peut avoir comp\u00e9tence sur la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9es. Dans l\u2019exercice de leur pouvoir de contr\u00f4le au titre de l\u2019article 18.1 de la LCF, les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales n\u2019ont comp\u00e9tence que sur les d\u00e9cisions ou les mesures prises par les offices f\u00e9d\u00e9raux. Dans un contexte semblable, notre Cour a souscrit \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision par laquelle la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le vote d\u2019un conseil de bande ne pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une \u00ab d\u00e9cision \u00bb pour l\u2019application de l\u2019article 18.1 de la LCF : Wanderingspirit, par. 17. S\u2019il en est ainsi pour un vote tenu lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union (certes tenue de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re) d\u2019un conseil de bande, il doit \u00e9galement en \u00eatre ainsi pour une p\u00e9tition sign\u00e9e par au moins 35 % des \u00e9lecteurs admissibles.\n[38] M\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait possible de soutenir que la d\u00e9claration est une \u00ab d\u00e9cision \u00bb en ce sens qu\u2019elle porte atteinte \u00e0 des droits et entra\u00eene des effets pr\u00e9judiciables, il serait exag\u00e9r\u00e9 et inadmissible d\u2019assimiler une p\u00e9tition citoyenne visant \u00e0 dissoudre le gouvernement pour des raisons non \u00e9lectorales \u00e0 un office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. En effet, ni le juge Grammond ni les parties n\u2019ont \u00e9tay\u00e9 cette affirmation par un quelconque pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. Bien que la jurisprudence ait \u00e9largi la notion d\u2019\u00ab office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb \u00e0 divers types d\u2019organismes d\u00e9cisionnels exer\u00e7ant un pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par les conseils de bande, je n\u2019ai connaissance d\u2019aucune d\u00e9cision o\u00f9 un groupe d\u2019\u00e9lecteurs admissibles (encore moins de p\u00e9titionnaires), d\u2019une taille minimale donn\u00e9e, a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Il n\u2019est pas suffisant que la d\u00e9claration (et la nouvelle \u00e9lection pr\u00e9vue) d\u00e9coule d\u2019un droit coutumier int\u00e9gr\u00e9 dans une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Pour qu\u2019il puisse y avoir contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, il doit tout de m\u00eame y avoir une \u00ab d\u00e9cision \u00bb rendue par un \u00ab office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb.\n[39] Pour tous les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je juge que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en concluant qu\u2019elle avait comp\u00e9tence pour proc\u00e9der au contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9claration ayant entra\u00een\u00e9 la dissolution du gouvernement de Nekaneet.\n2) Le processus administratif n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9puis\u00e9 [40] M\u00eame si, aux fins de la discussion, j\u2019\u00e9tais pr\u00eat \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la demande, il existe une autre raison imp\u00e9rieuse pour laquelle elle aurait d\u00fb refuser de le faire. Il est bien \u00e9tabli que le contr\u00f4le judiciaire est un recours discr\u00e9tionnaire. Lorsqu\u2019elles existent, les voies de recours ouvertes par le processus administratif doivent habituellement \u00eatre \u00e9puis\u00e9es avant que les cours puissent intervenir. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une r\u00e8gle fondamentale du droit administratif canadien, qui n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi clairement expliqu\u00e9e que dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Agence des services frontaliers) c. C.B. Powell Limited, 2010 CAF 61 (C.B. Powell), o\u00f9 notre Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit (par. 31) :\nLa doctrine et la jurisprudence en droit administratif utilisent diverses appellations pour d\u00e9signer ce principe : la doctrine de l\u2019\u00e9puisement des recours, la doctrine des autres voies de recours ad\u00e9quates, la doctrine interdisant le fractionnement ou la division des proc\u00e9dures administratives, le principe interdisant le contr\u00f4le judiciaire interlocutoire et l\u2019objection contre le contr\u00f4le judiciaire pr\u00e9matur\u00e9. Toutes ces formules expriment la m\u00eame id\u00e9e : \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de circonstances exceptionnelles, les parties ne peuvent s\u2019adresser aux tribunaux tant que le processus administratif suit son cours. Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de circonstances exceptionnelles, ceux qui sont insatisfaits de quelque aspect du d\u00e9roulement de la proc\u00e9dure administrative doivent exercer tous les recours efficaces qui leur sont ouverts dans le cadre de cette proc\u00e9dure. Ce n\u2019est que lorsque le processus administratif a atteint son terme ou que le processus administratif n\u2019ouvre aucun recours efficace qu\u2019il est possible de soumettre l\u2019affaire aux tribunaux. En d\u2019autres termes, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de circonstances exceptionnelles, les tribunaux ne peuvent intervenir dans un processus administratif tant que celui\u2011ci n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9 \u00e0 terme ou tant que les recours efficaces qui sont ouverts ne sont pas \u00e9puis\u00e9s.\n[41] Voir aussi les arr\u00eats cit\u00e9s au paragraphe 30 de l\u2019arr\u00eat C.B. Powell ainsi que les arr\u00eats suivants : Strickland c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CSC 37, par. 40 et 42; Halifax (Regional Municipality) c. Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Human Rights Commission), 2012 CSC 10, par. 35 \u00e0 37 (Halifax); Dugr\u00e9 c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2021 CAF 8, par. 37; Viaguard Accu-Metrics Laboratory c. Conseil canadien des normes, 2023 CAF 63, par. 4 et 5.\n[42] Comme il ressort de la jurisprudence, la retenue judiciaire se justifie sur les plans pratique et th\u00e9orique, notamment par le fait qu\u2019une intervention pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e de la part de la cour de r\u00e9vision risquerait de priver celle-ci d\u2019un dossier complet ainsi que des conclusions tir\u00e9es des faits et de la preuve par le d\u00e9cideur administratif. Ces conclusions se caract\u00e9risent souvent par le recours \u00e0 des connaissances sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es, par des d\u00e9cisions de principe et par une exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re r\u00e9glementaire : C.B. Powell, par. 32. En effet, une intervention judiciaire h\u00e2tive pourrait ouvrir la porte \u00e0 l\u2019assujettissement \u00e0 la norme de la \u00ab d\u00e9cision correcte \u00bb de questions de droit qu\u2019un tribunal administratif aurait pu raisonnablement interpr\u00e9ter diff\u00e9remment : Halifax, par. 36. Il est d\u2019autant plus crucial de faire preuve d\u2019une telle prudence dans un contexte autochtone, et surtout lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de litiges en mati\u00e8re de gouvernance et d\u2019\u00e9lection, o\u00f9 les cours sont d\u00e9savantag\u00e9es comparativement aux d\u00e9cideurs qui connaissent bien la culture et les traditions de la bande au sein de laquelle le litige a pris naissance.\n[43] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il ressortait clairement de l\u2019article 8.08 de la Constitution de Nekaneet que le tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet devait avoir comp\u00e9tence exclusive sur toutes les questions r\u00e9gies par une loi adopt\u00e9e par Nekaneet. Cet article est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\n8.08 Le tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet a comp\u00e9tence pour entendre et r\u00e9soudre tout conflit ou litige concernant une question r\u00e9gie par une loi de Nekaneet ou pour traiter des manquements \u00e0 une loi de Nekaneet au moyen de recours et de proc\u00e9dures justes et \u00e9quitables, conform\u00e9ment aux lois de Nekaneet.\n[44] L\u2019appelante soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait aucun autre recours administratif et que le tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet ne peut avoir comp\u00e9tence pour contr\u00f4ler une d\u00e9claration, puisque la raison d\u2019\u00eatre m\u00eame d\u2019une telle d\u00e9claration est de dissoudre le gouvernement lorsqu\u2019aucun tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet n\u2019est form\u00e9. C\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qui s\u2019est produit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[45] Avec \u00e9gards, cet argument ne tient pas la route. Tout d\u2019abord, je souligne en passant que l\u2019appelante ne sollicite pas devant notre Cour une ordonnance confirmant la destitution de la chef et du conseil actuels \u00e0 la date de la d\u00e9claration, mais seulement \u00e0 la date du jugement en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Elle accepte que la validit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9claration a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue dans l\u2019attente de la d\u00e9cision sur le fond par suite des injonctions prononc\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, lesquelles n\u2019ont pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un appel. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 encore plus clairement en affirmant, dans un courriel envoy\u00e9 le 9 ao\u00fbt 2023 aux membres du tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet, que sa cliente ne conteste pas devant notre Cour la validit\u00e9 de leur nomination.\n[46] M\u00eame si l\u2019on reconnaissait que la nomination des membres du tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet par la chef et le conseil le 28 avril 2023 \u00e9tait possiblement litigieuse, l\u2019instance \u00e0 laquelle il convenait de s\u2019adresser pour contester la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de ces nominations \u00e9tait le tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet. C\u2019est exactement ce qu\u2019a fait Mme Buffalocalf. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande devant le tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet en vertu de la Constitution de Nekaneet et de la Loi sur la gouvernance de Nekaneet en vue d\u2019obtenir diverses mesures de r\u00e9paration, dont une d\u00e9claration portant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e Carolyn Wahobin \u00e9tait in\u00e9ligible comme candidate au poste de chef et que M. Alvin Francis \u00e9tait \u00e9lu chef.\n[47] Le 25 juillet 2023, le tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet a rendu une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9liminaire portant sur certaines questions de comp\u00e9tence et, le 8 ao\u00fbt 2023, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de suspendre la demande. Bien que cette d\u00e9cision ne fasse pas partie du dossier, on nous a dit \u00e0 l\u2019audience que le tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet devait examiner la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la nomination de ses propres membres avant de se pencher sur le fond de la demande. C\u2019est exactement la bonne mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der. Si l\u2019appelante souhaitait contester cette d\u00e9cision, elle aurait pu d\u00e9poser une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Cette proc\u00e9dure aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 celle \u00e0 suivre, celle qui respecte le processus administratif \u00e9tabli dans la Constitution de Nekaneet. Les intim\u00e9es ont tent\u00e9 de court-circuiter ce processus en d\u00e9posant une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9claration devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais cette demande ne pouvait se substituer \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence exclusive qu\u2019a le tribunal d\u2019appel de Nekaneet pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a eu violation et juger de l\u2019\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 de la chef nouvellement \u00e9lue.\n3) L\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9pens et l\u2019appel incident [48] Dans le dossier A-276-23, les deux parties appellent de l\u2019ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 Mme Buffalocalf de verser des d\u00e9pens de 5 000 $. Dans l\u2019appel qu\u2019elles ont interjet\u00e9, la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Nekaneet, la chef Carolyn Wahobin et les conseill\u00e8res Roberta Francis et Christine Mosquito font valoir que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis des erreurs de droit susceptibles de contr\u00f4le, premi\u00e8rement en d\u00e9cidant que l\u2019article 420 des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, DORS 98\u2011106, ne s\u2019applique pas aux offres de r\u00e8glement qui pr\u00e9voient un compromis uniquement sur les d\u00e9pens et deuxi\u00e8mement en interpr\u00e9tant l\u2019article 16.04 de la Loi sur la gouvernance de Nekaneet, lequel interdit \u00e0 un chef ou \u00e0 un conseiller d\u2019utiliser les fonds de Nekaneet pour payer les frais juridiques li\u00e9s \u00e0 une contestation d\u2019\u00e9lection. Dans l\u2019appel incident, Mme Shauna Buffalocalf demande l\u2019annulation de l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et soutient notamment qu\u2019il \u00e9tait erron\u00e9 de conclure qu\u2019elle n\u2019agissait pas dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et qu\u2019elle devrait donc pouvoir se faire rembourser ses frais par la Premi\u00e8re Nation, et ce, ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019issue.\n[49] Compte tenu de ma conclusion sur le fond dans le dossier A-193-23, aucune ordonnance quant aux d\u00e9pens ne devrait \u00eatre rendue. La pr\u00e9sente affaire est quelque peu inhabituelle, puisque les deux parties ont soutenu que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la demande d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9es dans ce dossier. Apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas et que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait commis une erreur en souscrivant aux observations des parties \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, notre Cour n\u2019a donn\u00e9 gain de cause \u00e0 ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre des deux parties. Par cons\u00e9quent, chaque partie doit assumer ses propres frais.\n[50] En ce qui concerne l\u2019ordonnance quant aux d\u00e9pens rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, elle devrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9e, car l\u2019affaire n\u2019aurait initialement jamais d\u00fb \u00eatre entendue. Il est vrai qu\u2019en appel, notre Cour s\u2019abstient habituellement de modifier les d\u00e9cisions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale concernant les d\u00e9pens en raison de leur nature intrins\u00e8quement discr\u00e9tionnaire. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une erreur de principe ou d\u2019une attribution nettement erron\u00e9e que les cours d\u2019appel modifieront les ordonnances quant aux d\u00e9pens : voir, par exemple, Sun Indalex Finance, LLC c. Syndicat des M\u00e9tallos, 2013 CSC 6, par. 247; Tazehkand c. Banque du Canada, 2023 CAF 208, par. 92.\n[51] Cependant, la situation de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est diff\u00e9rente, car l\u2019affaire n\u2019aurait jamais d\u00fb \u00eatre entendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. En pareil cas, il peut \u00eatre appropri\u00e9 d\u2019annuler l\u2019ordonnance du tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance lorsque ce dernier s\u2019est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 tort comp\u00e9tent ou a d\u00e9clin\u00e9 \u00e0 tort comp\u00e9tence : Windsor, par. 72; Canada (Gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil) c. Premi\u00e8re Nation Crie Mikisew, 2016 CAF 311, par. 64 (conf. par 2018 CSC 40).\n[52] Le fait que les deux parties pr\u00e9tendent avoir des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res vient \u00e9galement renforcer mon avis selon lequel aucuns d\u00e9pens ne devraient \u00eatre adjug\u00e9s. Bien que ce facteur ne devrait \u00e9videmment pas \u00eatre d\u00e9terminant en soi, il peut \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration dans une affaire comme celle qui nous occupe, o\u00f9 aucune partie n\u2019a incontestablement gain de cause et o\u00f9 aucune all\u00e9gation de mauvaise foi n\u2019est formul\u00e9e.\n[53] Pour tous les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j\u2019annulerais la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le dossier A-193-23 et l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le dossier A-276-23, sans d\u00e9pens. Les deux parties devraient donc assumer leurs propres frais devant notre Cour et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n\u00ab Yves de Montigny \u00bb\nJuge en chef\n\u00ab Je suis d\u2019accord\nRen\u00e9 LeBlanc j.c.a. \u00bb\n\u00ab Je suis d\u2019accord\nElizabeth Walker j.c.a. \u00bb\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\nA-193-23\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nSHAUNA BUFFALOCALF c.

Aper\u00e7u [1] La Banque le Choix du Pr\u00e9sident (la Banque PC) offre des services financiers. De concert avec des personnes morales li\u00e9es, elle participe \u00e9galement \u00e0 un programme de fid\u00e9lisation dont le principal objectif est d\u2019accro\u00eetre les ventes au d\u00e9tail des magasins Loblaws. Dans le cadre du programme, elle donne des points aux titulaires de carte de cr\u00e9dit lorsqu\u2019ils utilisent leur carte. Les titulaires de carte de cr\u00e9dit ne peuvent utiliser ces points que dans des magasins Loblaws pour obtenir des rabais sur leurs achats. La Banque PC rembourse Loblaws pour le rabais que les clients re\u00e7oivent lorsqu\u2019ils \u00e9changent leurs points dans des magasins Loblaws (paiement de rachat).\n[2] Dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent appel, la question \u00e0 trancher est de savoir si la Banque PC peut demander des cr\u00e9dits fictifs de taxe sur les intrants (CTI fictifs) pour le paiement de rachat. La ministre du Revenu national reconna\u00eet que le paiement de rachat satisfait \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res relatifs aux CTI fictifs, sauf un : le paiement doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 par la Banque PC \u00ab dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales \u00bb. La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (la CCI), qui a tranch\u00e9 en faveur de la ministre (2022 CCI 84), a conclu que le paiement de rachat est effectu\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 de prestation de services financiers. La Banque PC interjette appel de la d\u00e9cision de la CCI.\n[3] Pour les motifs qui suivent, j\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel. Le paiement de rachat satisfait aux crit\u00e8res relatifs aux CTI fictifs pr\u00e9vus au paragraphe 181(5) de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, L.R.C. (1985), ch. E-15 (la Loi). \u00c0 moins d\u2019indication contraire, les dispositions mentionn\u00e9es se trouvent dans la Loi.\nII. Contexte A. Contexte l\u00e9gislatif [4] La partie IX de la Loi impose une taxe sur la plupart des fournitures de biens et de services, soit la taxe sur les produits et services (la TPS) : paragraphes 123(1), d\u00e9finition de \u00ab fourniture taxable \u00bb, 165(1). La TPS est une taxe \u00e0 la consommation. Elle est pay\u00e9e par le consommateur final. Il s\u2019agit \u00e9galement d\u2019une taxe sur la valeur ajout\u00e9e, puisque chaque entreprise de la cha\u00eene d\u2019approvisionnement paie de la TPS sur la valeur que cette entreprise ajoute au bien ou au service. Le cr\u00e9dit de taxe sur les intrants (CTI) est le m\u00e9canisme mis en place pour veiller \u00e0 ce que la TPS op\u00e8re comme telle : Calgary (Ville) c. Canada, 2012 CSC 20 au para. 16; Banque de Montr\u00e9al c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2020 CF 1014 au para. 10.\n[5] L\u2019exemple suivant illustre ce m\u00e9canisme. Il suppose un taux combin\u00e9 de TPS f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et de taxe de vente harmonis\u00e9e (la TVH) provinciale de 15 %. Un fournisseur vend une bouteille de shampoing \u00e0 un d\u00e9taillant pour 6,00 $, et le d\u00e9taillant paie 0,90 $ au titre de la TPS\/TVH. Le d\u00e9taillant vend ensuite la bouteille de shampoing 10,00 $ \u00e0 un client au Canada, ayant ajout\u00e9 une valeur de 4,00 $ et factur\u00e9 au client 1,50 $ au titre de la TPS\/TVH. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 le d\u00e9taillant fournit la bouteille de shampoing dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales, il a droit \u00e0 un CTI de 0,90 $, ce qui correspond \u00e0 la TPS\/TVH qu\u2019il a pay\u00e9e au fournisseur : paragraphe 169(1). Ainsi, le d\u00e9taillant ne verse que 0,60 $ au titre de la TPS\/TVH au gouvernement, ce qui correspond \u00e0 la taxe sur la valeur de 4,00 $ qu\u2019il a ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 la bouteille de shampoing.\n[6] Lorsque le d\u00e9taillant accepte que le client paie une partie du prix de 10,00 $ pour la bouteille de shampoing \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un bon de 1,00 $ ou de points \u00e9changeables \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 1,00 $ (correspondant \u00e0 un bon aux fins de la Loi) et qu\u2019il s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une autre personne lui rembourse le montant de 1,00 $, les r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019article 181 s\u2019appliquent.\n[7] En vertu des alin\u00e9as 181(2)a) et b), la taxe percevable et per\u00e7ue par le d\u00e9taillant est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00e9gale \u00e0 celle qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7ue sans le bon. Dans l\u2019exemple ci-dessus, et comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 la CCI au paragraphe 17 de ses motifs, le d\u00e9taillant est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir per\u00e7u, et doit verser, 1,50 $ :\n[traduction]\nPrix du shampoing\n10,00 $\nTPS\/TVH de 15 %\n1,50 $\nTotal partiel\n11,50 $\nMoins le bon\n(1,00 $)\nLe client paie\n10,50 $\n[8] Les alin\u00e9as 181(2)a) et b) entra\u00eenent un paiement en trop de taxe : le gouvernement per\u00e7oit 1,50 $, alors que normalement, un achat de 9,00 $ donnerait lieu \u00e0 un montant de TPS\/TVH de 1,35 $.\n[9] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 181(2)c) et le paragraphe 181(5) all\u00e8gent ce paiement en trop.\n[10] Premi\u00e8rement, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 181(2)c), la taxe payable par l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur (l\u2019acheteur des biens ou des services) est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00e9gale \u00e0 la taxe percevable moins la fraction de taxe de la valeur du bon. Le paragraphe 181(1) d\u00e9finit la fraction de taxe de la valeur du bon comme \u00e9tant le r\u00e9sultat du calcul A\/B, o\u00f9 :\nA repr\u00e9sente la somme du taux fix\u00e9 au paragraphe 165(1) (5 %) et du taux de taxe applicable \u00e0 la province (10 % dans le pr\u00e9sent exemple) (5 % + 10 % = 15 %), et\nB est la somme de 100 % et du pourcentage d\u00e9termin\u00e9 selon l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment A (100 % + 15 % = 115 %).\nAinsi, dans l\u2019exemple ci-dessus, la fraction de taxe du bon de 1,00 $ correspond \u00e0 15\/115 = 0,13 (13 %), et la taxe r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre payable par l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur est de 1,37 $, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire 1,50 $ moins 0,13 $.\n[11] Deuxi\u00e8mement, le paragraphe 181(5) all\u00e8ge le paiement en trop de taxe [traduction] \u00ab en accordant \u00e0 la personne qui [rach\u00e8te le bon] un cr\u00e9dit de taxe sur les intrants et en faisant en sorte que c\u2019est le montant net global exact de taxe qui est vers\u00e9 au gouvernement pour la fourniture effectu\u00e9e par le fournisseur \u00bb : Canada, minist\u00e8re des Finances, Draft Legislation to Amend the Excise Tax Act (GST) and Related Statutes, Explanatory Notes (Septembre 1992) \u00e0 la p. 106 [Notes explicatives de 1992]. Pour ce faire, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 181(5)c) accorde \u00e0 la personne rachetant le bon un CTI fictif \u00e9gal \u00e0 la fraction de taxe de la valeur du bon. Dans l\u2019exemple ci-dessus, la personne qui paie pour les points \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 1,00 $ aurait le droit de demander un CTI fictif de 0,13 $.\n[12] Fait essentiel dans le pr\u00e9sent appel, le paragraphe 181(5) ne s\u2019applique que lorsque la personne rachetant le bon le fait dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales : Canada, minist\u00e8re des Finances, notes techniques concernant le paragraphe 181(5), f\u00e9vrier 1993. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le paragraphe 181(5) pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une autre personne peut demander un CTI lorsqu\u2019elle \u00ab verse dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales un montant au fournisseur pour racheter le bon \u00bb.\nB. Contexte factuel [13] Dans ses motifs, la CCI expose les faits de mani\u00e8re assez d\u00e9taill\u00e9e. Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 suivant suffit pour les besoins du pr\u00e9sent appel.\n[14] La Banque PC, Loblaws Inc. (Loblaws) et Services le Choix du Pr\u00e9sident inc. (SCPI) sont des filiales \u00e0 cent pour cent directes ou indirectes des Compagnies Loblaw Limit\u00e9e.\n[15] La Banque PC est une institution financi\u00e8re aux fins de la Loi. Elle est \u00e9galement inscrite pour l\u2019application de la partie IX de la Loi.\n[16] La Banque PC \u00e9met des cartes de cr\u00e9dit MasterCard de la marque le Choix du Pr\u00e9sident (MasterCard PC) \u00e0 ses clients (les titulaires de carte de cr\u00e9dit). Les titulaires de la carte de cr\u00e9dit MasterCard PC peuvent utiliser leur carte pour faire des achats dans les magasins qui acceptent cette carte de cr\u00e9dit et obtenir des points de fid\u00e9lisation. Chaque fois qu\u2019une carte MasterCard PC est utilis\u00e9e, la Banque PC re\u00e7oit des commissions d\u2019interchange.\n[17] La Banque PC est \u00e9galement partie \u00e0 trois accords, rectifi\u00e9s en vertu d\u2019une ordonnance de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice de l\u2019Ontario : 1) le contrat de licence conclu avec SCPI, 2) l\u2019accord sur les services de fid\u00e9lisation, \u00e9galement conclu avec SCPI, et 3) l\u2019accord sur les paiements relatifs au programme de fid\u00e9lisation, conclu avec SCPI et Loblaws. Ces accords sont \u00e0 la base du programme de fid\u00e9lisation. Pour le groupe de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Loblaws, le principal objectif du programme de fid\u00e9lisation est d\u2019accro\u00eetre les ventes au d\u00e9tail des magasins Loblaws, dont les revenus d\u00e9passent largement les revenus que la carte MasterCard procure \u00e0 la Banque PC.\n[18] Dans le cadre du programme de fid\u00e9lisation,\na)La Banque PC d\u00e9tient une licence libre de redevances pour donner des points de fid\u00e9lisation \u00e0 ses titulaires de carte de cr\u00e9dit MasterCard PC. Elle leur en donne chaque fois qu\u2019ils utilisent leur carte MasterCard PC. Cependant, les titulaires de carte de cr\u00e9dit gagnent plus de points de fid\u00e9lisation pour les achats qu\u2019ils font dans un magasin Loblaws, et ils peuvent uniquement utiliser leurs points dans des magasins que poss\u00e8de ou contr\u00f4le Loblaws;\nb)Loblaws verse \u00e0 la Banque PC :\n0,75 cents pour chaque 1,00 $ d\u2019achats que les titulaires de carte de cr\u00e9dit font dans des magasins Loblaws \u00e0 l\u2019aide de leur carte MasterCard PC et pour lesquels la Banque PC leur donne des points de fid\u00e9lisation; et\n0,35 $ pour chaque tranche de points de fid\u00e9lisation \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 1,00 $ que les titulaires de carte de cr\u00e9dit utilisent dans des magasins Loblaws; et\nc)La Banque PC rembourse\/verse \u00e0 Loblaws 1,00 $ pour chaque tranche de points de fid\u00e9lisation \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 1,00 $ que les titulaires de carte de cr\u00e9dit utilisent dans des magasins Loblaws (le paiement de rachat).\n[19] Tel que susmentionn\u00e9, les parties s\u2019entendent sur tous les crit\u00e8res relatifs aux CTI fictifs, sauf un. Leur d\u00e9saccord porte sur la question de savoir si la Banque PC effectue le paiement de rachat \u00ab dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales \u00bb.\nIII. D\u00e9cision de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t [20] La CCI a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle devait d\u00e9terminer si le \u00ab paiement de rachat [est] li\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation par la Banque [PC] de fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es ou taxables \u00bb : motifs de la CCI au para. 66. La CCI a conclu que la Banque PC effectue le paiement de rachat \u00ab dans le cadre de [ses] activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 la carte MasterCard, qui comprennent la fourniture exon\u00e9r\u00e9e de services financiers aux titulaires de carte \u00bb : motifs de la CCI aux para. 65, 67, 75. Elle a tir\u00e9 cette conclusion pour les motifs suivants :\na) L\u2019activit\u00e9 principale de la Banque PC est la fourniture \u00e0 ses clients de services financiers : motifs de la CCI aux para. 70\u201371;\nb) Les revenus que la Banque PC tire de Loblaws sont d\u00e9risoires par rapport aux revenus importants qu\u2019elle tire des commissions d\u2019interchange : motifs de la CCI aux para. 67, 73;\nc) Il est inconcevable et incompatible avec les pratiques commerciales normales que la Banque PC accepte de faire un paiement de rachat de 1,00 $ pour gagner 0,35 $ et donc perdre de l\u2019argent : motifs de la CCI aux para. 67, 73, 77; et\nd) La Banque PC effectue le paiement de rachat de points de fid\u00e9lisation en contrepartie de l\u2019\u00e9mission des points de fid\u00e9lisation : motifs de la CCI au para. 82.\nIV. Question en litige et norme de contr\u00f4le [21] Dans leurs m\u00e9moires des faits et du droit, les deux parties reconnaissent que la question en litige concerne l\u2019expression \u00ab dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales \u00bb figurant au paragraphe 181(5). L\u2019appelante soutient que la question en litige est de savoir si la CCI a commis une erreur de droit dans son interpr\u00e9tation de cette expression. L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que la question \u00e0 trancher est de savoir si la CCI a commis une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante en concluant que la Banque PC n\u2019effectue pas le paiement de rachat \u00ab dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales \u00bb.\n[22] Au bout du compte, il faut recourir \u00e0 la norme applicable en appel : Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33 aux para. 8, 37. Les questions de droit sont assujetties \u00e0 la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte, et les questions de fait ne sont r\u00e9visables qu\u2019en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante. Les conclusions mixtes de fait et de droit sont assujetties \u00e0 la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elles soient entach\u00e9es d\u2019une erreur de droit isolable. Les erreurs de droit isolables sont assujetties \u00e0 la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte.\n[23] La question de savoir si la Banque PC effectue le paiement de rachat dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales est une question mixte de fait et de droit. Par cons\u00e9quent, la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte s\u2019applique dans la mesure o\u00f9 la CCI a commis une erreur de droit isolable en tranchant cette question.\nV. Analyse [24] Je suis d\u2019avis que la CCI a commis deux erreurs de droit isolables. Premi\u00e8rement, elle a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019expression \u00ab dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales \u00bb suppose l\u2019application d\u2019un test \u00ab soit l\u2019une soit l\u2019autre \u00bb. Deuxi\u00e8mement, elle a tenu compte de la rentabilit\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019existence d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Si nous isolons ces deux erreurs de droit, les conclusions de fait de la CCI d\u00e9montrent que la Banque PC effectue le paiement de rachat dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales consistant \u00e0 accro\u00eetre les ventes au d\u00e9tail des magasins Loblaws. Dans l\u2019analyse qui suit, j\u2019expose les erreurs de droit commises par la CCI, puis j\u2019explique comment le fait d\u2019isoler ces erreurs influe sur l\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire.\nA. Il n\u2019y a pas de test \u00ab soit l\u2019une soit l\u2019autre \u00bb [25] La CCI a fond\u00e9 son analyse sur la pr\u00e9misse qu\u2019elle devait d\u00e9terminer si la Banque PC effectue le paiement de rachat dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 de prestation de services financiers ou dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Elle a adopt\u00e9 cette pr\u00e9misse en expliquant qu\u2019elle devait examiner la preuve pour d\u00e9terminer si le \u00ab paiement de rachat [est] li\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation par la Banque PC de fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es ou taxables \u00bb (non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original) : motifs de la CCI au para. 66. Cependant, il ressort du libell\u00e9, du contexte et de l\u2019objet du paragraphe 181(5) qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un test \u00ab soit l\u2019une soit l\u2019autre \u00bb. En effet, cette disposition permet \u00e0 une personne de verser un montant dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales et dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s non commerciales.\n1) Libell\u00e9 [26] Le paragraphe 181(5) pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une autre personne (une personne qui n\u2019est ni le fournisseur ni l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur) peut demander un CTI lorsqu\u2019elle \u00ab verse dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales un montant au fournisseur pour racheter le bon \u00bb. Le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 181(5) n\u2019exige pas que montant soit vers\u00e9 \u00ab exclusivement \u00bb ou \u00ab principalement \u00bb dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Contrairement aux termes \u00ab exclusivement \u00bb et \u00ab principalement \u00bb, l\u2019expression \u00ab dans le cadre de \u00bb a un sens large et signifie \u00ab d\u00e9coulant de \u00bb ou \u00ab relativement \u00e0 \u00bb, que ce soit directement ou indirectement : Metropolitan Toronto Hockey League c. Canada, [1995] A.C.F. no 944, au para. 14, note 1; Blanchard c. Canada, [1995] A.C.F. no 1045; M.R.N. c. Yonge Eglinton Building Ltd., 1974 CanLII 2476 (CAF), [1974] 1 C.F. 637 aux pp. 644\u2013645.\n[27] En interpr\u00e9tant le paragraphe 181(5) comme signifiant qu\u2019une personne peut uniquement verser un montant dans le cadre d\u2019une seule activit\u00e9 ou comme exigeant que le montant ait principalement un lien avec une activit\u00e9 commerciale, on vient ajouter des mots \u00e0 la Loi.\n2) Contexte [28] Le contexte du paragraphe 181(5) \u00e9taye l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation textuelle susmentionn\u00e9e.\na) Un montant peut \u00eatre vers\u00e9 dans le cadre de plus d\u2019une activit\u00e9 [29] Les paragraphes 169(1), 141(2) et (4), et 202(2), ainsi que les alin\u00e9as 199(2)a), 217.1(6)c) et 217.1(7)c) montrent que la Loi pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019un montant peut \u00eatre vers\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 et dans le cadre d\u2019une autre. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la Loi pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019un paiement peut \u00eatre fait dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 non commerciale.\n(i) Paragraphe 169(1) [30] Le paragraphe 169(1) \u00e9nonce la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale relative aux CTI. Il contient la formule permettant de calculer le CTI accord\u00e9 pour la taxe pay\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 un bien ou \u00e0 un service dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019inscrit l\u2019acquiert pour l\u2019utiliser dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales. Cette formule fait en sorte que l\u2019inscrit a droit \u00e0 un CTI calcul\u00e9 selon le pourcentage que repr\u00e9sente l\u2019utilisation que l\u2019inscrit fait du bien ou du service dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales. L\u2019inclusion de la formule pr\u00e9suppose que le bien ou le service peut \u00eatre acquis par la personne pour utilisation dans le cadre de plus d\u2019une activit\u00e9. C\u2019\u00e9tait le cas dans l\u2019affaire Midland Hutterian Brethren c. Canada, 2000 CanLII 16725 (CAF) [Midland], o\u00f9 une colonie avait achet\u00e9 du tissu pour fabriquer des v\u00eatements de travail \u00e0 l\u2019usage de ses membres. Les membres pouvaient utiliser le tissu pour fabriquer deux sortes de v\u00eatements : les v\u00eatements de travail pour l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale de la colonie (l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise agricole) et les v\u00eatements pour leurs activit\u00e9s personnelles. Notre Cour a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument du ministre de l\u2019\u00e9poque selon lequel toute utilisation personnelle d\u2019un v\u00eatement faisait que le tissu de travail ne donnait pas droit \u00e0 un CTI et a conclu que la colonie avait droit \u00e0 un CTI calcul\u00e9 suivant la formule pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 169(1).\n[31] Dans Midland, la Cour n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 pas la question de savoir si la colonie a pay\u00e9 le tissu dans le cadre de son activit\u00e9 commerciale ou dans le cadre de son activit\u00e9 non commerciale consistant \u00e0 fournir du tissu \u00e0 ses membres pour leur usage personnel. Toutefois, \u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 le tissu avait \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9 pour utilisation dans le cadre de plus d\u2019une activit\u00e9, il est logique de conclure que la colonie a vers\u00e9 le montant pour le tissu dans le cadre de deux activit\u00e9s.\n(ii) Paragraphes 141(2) et (4) [32] Le paragraphe 141(2) pr\u00e9voit que lorsqu\u2019une personne utilise un bien ou un service \u00ab presque en totalit\u00e9 \u00bb dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales, l\u2019utilisation ou la consommation pour laquelle la personne a acquis le bien ou le service est r\u00e9put\u00e9e se faire en totalit\u00e9 dans ce cadre. De m\u00eame, le paragraphe 141(4) pr\u00e9voit que lorsqu\u2019une personne utilise un bien ou un service presque en totalit\u00e9 dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s non commerciales, l\u2019utilisation ou la consommation pour laquelle la personne a acquis le bien ou le service est r\u00e9put\u00e9e se faire en totalit\u00e9 dans ce cadre. Ce libell\u00e9 d\u00e9montre que le l\u00e9gislateur consid\u00e8re qu\u2019une acquisition peut \u00eatre faite presque en totalit\u00e9 \u2014 mais pas en totalit\u00e9 \u2014 dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 et, dans une moindre mesure, dans le cadre d\u2019une autre activit\u00e9. L\u00e0 encore, cela implique que le montant pour le bien ou le service est vers\u00e9 dans le cadre de plus d\u2019une activit\u00e9.\n(iii) Paragraphe 202(2) [33] Le paragraphe 202(2) pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019un inscrit n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 un CTI relativement \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition d\u2019une voiture de tourisme ou d\u2019un a\u00e9ronef, \u00e0 moins que ce soit \u00ab pour utilisation exclusive dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales \u00bb (non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original). Le fait que le l\u00e9gislateur exige que la voiture ou l\u2019a\u00e9ronef soit acquis pour utilisation exclusive dans le cadre d\u2019activit\u00e9s commerciales pr\u00e9suppose que la voiture ou l\u2019a\u00e9ronef peut \u00eatre acquis \u2014 et donc le montant vers\u00e9 pour cette voiture ou cet a\u00e9ronef \u2014 dans le cadre d\u2019activit\u00e9s commerciales et non commerciales.\n(iv) Alin\u00e9a 199(2)a) [34] De m\u00eame, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 199(2)a) pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019inscrit n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 un CTI relativement \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition d\u2019un bien meuble \u00e0 utiliser comme immobilisation, \u00e0 moins que le bien soit acquis \u00ab en vue d\u2019\u00eatre utilis\u00e9 principalement dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales \u00bb (non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original). L\u00e0 encore, l\u2019exigence d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir le bien en vue de l\u2019utiliser principalement dans le cadre d\u2019activit\u00e9s commerciales pr\u00e9suppose que le bien peut \u00eatre acquis, et le montant vers\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de celui-ci fait, dans le cadre de plus d\u2019une activit\u00e9.\n(v) Alin\u00e9as 217.1(6)c) et 217.1(7)c) [35] Les alin\u00e9as 217.1(6)c) et 217.1(7)c) pr\u00e9voient les r\u00e8gles de calcul des CTI et des remboursements que les institutions financi\u00e8res peuvent demander dans le contexte de la section IV, Taxe sur les fournitures taxables import\u00e9es. Selon ces alin\u00e9as, il faut d\u00e9terminer la mesure dans laquelle une d\u00e9pense a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e ou effectu\u00e9e par l\u2019institution financi\u00e8re \u00ab dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales \u00bb. S\u2019il est question de la \u00ab mesure dans laquelle \u00bb une d\u00e9pense a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale, alors il doit y avoir une mesure dans laquelle cette d\u00e9pense a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 non commerciale. Par cons\u00e9quent, le l\u00e9gislateur pr\u00e9suppose qu\u2019un montant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une seule d\u00e9pense peut \u00eatre simultan\u00e9ment vers\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 non commerciale. Cela renforce l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation selon laquelle le l\u00e9gislateur, lors de la r\u00e9daction du paragraphe 181(5), a pr\u00e9suppos\u00e9 que le montant pour le rachat d\u2019un bon pouvait \u00eatre vers\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 non commerciale.\n[36] Lorsqu\u2019il a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le paragraphe 181(5), le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pas eu recours \u00e0 un libell\u00e9 explicite voulant que le cr\u00e9dit soit accord\u00e9 uniquement \u00ab dans la mesure \u00bb o\u00f9 la personne verse un montant dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. L\u2019absence d\u2019un tel libell\u00e9 montre que le l\u00e9gislateur avait l\u2019intention d\u2019accorder un CTI fictif relativement au montant total vers\u00e9 pour le rachat d\u2019un bon d\u00e8s lors que le versement est fait dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale.\n(vi) Contexte particulier du paragraphe 181(5) [37] Bon nombre des dispositions dont il est question plus haut portent sur la taxe pay\u00e9e dans le contexte de l\u2019acquisition d\u2019un bien ou d\u2019un service, ce qui est logique puisque c\u2019est habituellement une telle op\u00e9ration (ou une op\u00e9ration \u00e9quivalente, p. ex. une importation) qui donne lieu \u00e0 un montant de TPS \u00e0 payer. Dans le cas d\u2019un bon, ce n\u2019est pas l\u2019autre personne qui paie le bon ou effectue le paiement de rachat qui acquiert un bien ou un service, mais bien le client. Dans l\u2019exemple dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le client acquiert une bouteille de shampoing, et l\u2019autre personne paie le bon. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour le paragraphe 181(5), il \u00e9tait impossible d\u2019adopter le m\u00eame libell\u00e9 que celui des paragraphes 169(1), 141(2) et (4), et 202(2), de m\u00eame que des alin\u00e9as 199(2)a), 217.1(6)c) et 217.1(7)c). Cela dit, du moment o\u00f9 la Loi reconna\u00eet qu\u2019un montant peut \u00eatre vers\u00e9 pour un bien ou un service dans le cadre de plus d\u2019une activit\u00e9, il n\u2019y a aucune raison pour qu\u2019un montant pour racheter un bon ne puisse \u00eatre vers\u00e9 dans le cadre de plus d\u2019une activit\u00e9.\nb) La pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un lien particulier entre le montant vers\u00e9 pour le rachat du bon et l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale n\u2019est pas obligatoire [38] Il ressort \u00e9galement des paragraphes 169(1) et 202(2) ainsi que des alin\u00e9as 199(2)a), 217.1(6)c) et 217.1(7)c) que, lorsque le l\u00e9gislateur veut qu\u2019un bien ou un service acquis ait un lien particulier avec une activit\u00e9 commerciale, il l\u2019indique express\u00e9ment.\n[39] Par exemple, le paragraphe 169(1) et les alin\u00e9as 217.1(6)c) et 217.1(7)c) pr\u00e9voient qu\u2019un CTI ne sera accord\u00e9 que dans \u00ab la mesure \u00bb o\u00f9 le bien ou le service est acquis ou la d\u00e9pense est engag\u00e9e ou effectu\u00e9e pour utilisation dans le cadre d\u2019activit\u00e9s commerciales. Le paragraphe 202(2) exige que l\u2019inscrit qui acquiert une voiture ou un a\u00e9ronef le fasse \u00ab pour utilisation exclusive dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales \u00bb. Pour sa part, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 199(2)a) exige qu\u2019un bien meuble \u00e0 utiliser comme immobilisation soit acquis \u00ab en vue d\u2019\u00eatre utilis\u00e9 principalement dans le cadre [des] activit\u00e9s commerciales \u00bb de l\u2019inscrit. L\u2019absence d\u2019une contrainte semblable au paragraphe 181(5) d\u00e9montre que le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention d\u2019exiger un lien plus \u00e9troit entre le montant vers\u00e9 pour le rachat du bon et l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale de l\u2019inscrit.\nc) Il ressort de la structure de la Loi qu\u2019on ne peut appliquer au paragraphe 181(5) la m\u00e9thode de r\u00e9partition pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 169(1) [40] Il peut \u00eatre tentant d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le paragraphe 181(5) \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale relative aux CTI \u00e9tablie au paragraphe 169(1), lequel pr\u00e9voit une formule qui n\u2019accorde des CTI que dans la mesure o\u00f9 le bien ou le service a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019on peut \u00eatre tent\u00e9 d\u2019inf\u00e9rer de la m\u00e9thode de r\u00e9partition pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 169(1) que le l\u00e9gislateur ne pr\u00e9voyait pas que la totalit\u00e9 du montant pour le rachat du bon au titre du paragraphe 181(5) puisse \u00eatre vers\u00e9e dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 de prestation de services financiers. Cette inf\u00e9rence n\u2019aurait pas de fondement, car il ressort de la structure de la Loi qu\u2019on ne peut appliquer au paragraphe 181(5) la m\u00e9thode de r\u00e9partition pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 169(1).\n[41] Le paragraphe 169(1) se trouve \u00e0 la sous-section B de la section II de la partie IX. La sous-section B a pour titre \u00ab Cr\u00e9dit de taxe sur les intrants \u00bb et renferme des r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales relatives aux CTI. La sous-section C, o\u00f9 se trouve l\u2019article 181, est intitul\u00e9e \u00ab Cas sp\u00e9ciaux \u00bb. Elle comporte de nombreuses r\u00e8gles visant \u00e0 r\u00e9gir les cas \u00ab sp\u00e9ciaux \u00bb pour lesquels l\u2019application des r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales \u00e9tablies \u00e0 la sous-section B entra\u00eenerait des r\u00e9sultats incongrus peu souhaitables par le l\u00e9gislateur : CWAY Logistics Ltd. c. La Reine, 2017 CCI 225 au para. 24. Cette distinction \u00e9tablie par la structure donne \u00e0 penser que le l\u00e9gislateur avait l\u2019intention de r\u00e9server un traitement distinct ou \u00ab sp\u00e9cial \u00bb aux CTI accord\u00e9s pour le rachat de bons. Par cons\u00e9quent, il faut se garder d\u2019appliquer au paragraphe 181(5) la m\u00e9thode de r\u00e9partition pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 169(1) et de conclure qu\u2019un paiement de rachat peut seulement \u00eatre fait dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale ou dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 non commerciale.\n3) Objet [42] Le paragraphe 181(5) a pour objet de faire en sorte que c\u2019est le [traduction] \u00ab montant net global exact de [taxe] qui est vers\u00e9 au gouvernement pour la fourniture effectu\u00e9e par le fournisseur \u00bb : Notes explicatives de 1992 \u00e0 la p. 106 (non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original).\n[43] Dans l\u2019exemple pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de la bouteille de shampoing, le d\u00e9taillant est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir per\u00e7u un montant de 1,50 $ au titre de la TPS\/TVH, qu\u2019il doit d\u00e9clarer et verser au gouvernement, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire 15 % de 10,00 $ (le prix de la bouteille de shampoing avant application du bon). Pourtant, le client n\u2019a pas pay\u00e9 le plein prix de la bouteille de shampoing; il n\u2019a pay\u00e9 que 9,00 $. Si la personne qui rach\u00e8te le bon a pay\u00e9 l\u2019autre partie du prix de la bouteille de shampoing \u2014 le reliquat de 1,00 $ \u2014 dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale, elle a le droit de demander un CTI fictif correspondant \u00e0 la fraction de taxe de la partie qu\u2019elle a pay\u00e9e. Sans le CTI fictif, le gouvernement percevrait de la taxe en trop.\n[44] Il y a paiement en trop, et l\u2019objet du paragraphe 181(5) est de rembourser ce paiement en trop. Cet objet concorde avec le choix du l\u00e9gislateur d\u2019utiliser une expression g\u00e9n\u00e9rale comme \u00ab dans le cadre de \u00bb, qui exige simplement qu\u2019un montant soit vers\u00e9 \u00ab relativement \u00e0 \u00bb une activit\u00e9 commerciale ou qu\u2019il en \u00ab d\u00e9coule \u00bb. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019imposition d\u2019un test \u00ab soit l\u2019une soit l\u2019autre \u00bb aurait pour cons\u00e9quence de restreindre les CTI fictifs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de montants vers\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s commerciales, une telle restriction contreviendrait \u00e0 l\u2019objectif poursuivi par le l\u00e9gislateur.\n[45] De plus, le fait que la personne qui rach\u00e8te le bon soit une institution financi\u00e8re n\u2019a aucune importance si le paiement de rachat est fait dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Lorsque le l\u00e9gislateur veut emp\u00eacher les institutions financi\u00e8res de demander un CTI, il l\u2019indique express\u00e9ment : voir les dispositions 141, 199(1) et 200(1). Le paragraphe 181(5) ne renferme aucune exclusion de la sorte.\n4) Conclusion : premi\u00e8re erreur de droit isolable [46] Il ressort de l\u2019analyse textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique que le paragraphe 181(5) ne rec\u00e8le pas un test \u00ab soit l\u2019une soit l\u2019autre \u00bb : un montant peut \u00eatre vers\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 non commerciale. Le paragraphe 181(5) n\u2019oblige pas le tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer dans le cadre de laquelle des deux activit\u00e9s le montant pour le rachat du bon est vers\u00e9. De plus, le paragraphe 181(5) n\u2019exige pas que le montant vers\u00e9 ait \u00ab principalement \u00bb ou \u00ab exclusivement \u00bb un lien avec une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Par cons\u00e9quent, la CCI a commis une erreur de droit en fondant son analyse sur la pr\u00e9misse qu\u2019elle devait d\u00e9terminer si le paiement de rachat \u00e9tait fait dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 de prestation de services financiers ou dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale.\n[47] \u00c0 la d\u00e9charge de la CCI, l\u2019affaire semble lui avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e comme un dossier dans lequel il fallait appliquer un test \u00ab soit l\u2019une soit l\u2019autre \u00bb : [traduction] \u00ab Observations \u00e9crites de l\u2019appelante \u00e0 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t concernant la question des CTI fictifs \u00bb, dossier d\u2019appel suppl\u00e9mentaire, vol. 8, onglet 16 \u00e0 la p. 2529 au para. 90; voir aussi [traduction] \u00ab Transcription des d\u00e9clarations liminaires, dat\u00e9e du 31 janvier 2022 \u00bb, dossier d\u2019appel suppl\u00e9mentaire, vol. 8, onglet 14 \u00e0 la p. 2480\u20132481. Cependant, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que 1) ce nouvel argument de l\u2019appelante vise une question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative, que 2) ce nouvel argument ne cause aucun pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui a eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter une preuve pour le r\u00e9futer, et que 3) l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de ce nouvel argument, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice d\u2019examiner ce nouvel argument : Koch c. Borgatti (Succession), 2022 CAF 201 au para. 67; Quan c. Cusson, 2009 CSC 62 aux para. 36\u201337; Eli Lilly Canada Inc. c.

Voil\u00e0 pourquoi j\u2019ai proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une analyse l\u00e9gislative du paragraphe 181(5).\n[48] J\u2019examinerai maintenant la deuxi\u00e8me erreur de droit commise par la CCI.\nB. L\u2019existence d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale ne d\u00e9pend pas de la rentabilit\u00e9 [49] La CCI a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la Banque PC n\u2019avait pas \u00e9tabli la nature de l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale all\u00e9gu\u00e9e pour laquelle elle demande des CTI fictifs : motifs de la CCI aux para. 72\u201377. La Banque PC a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale consistait \u00e0 accro\u00eetre les ventes au d\u00e9tail de Loblaws dans le cadre de sa participation au programme de fid\u00e9lisation : motifs de la CCI au para. 72; [traduction] \u00ab Observations \u00e9crites de l\u2019appelante \u00e0 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t concernant la question des CTI fictifs \u00bb, dossier d\u2019appel suppl\u00e9mentaire, vol. 8, onglet 16, 2505, 2508\u20132510, 2529 aux para. 2, 15\u201321, 32, 89. La CCI a refus\u00e9 de conclure qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Elle a plut\u00f4t conclu que cette affirmation \u00e9tait incompatible avec les \u00ab pratiques commerciales normales \u00bb, puisqu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00ab inimaginable \u00bb que \u00ab l\u2019appelante accepterait de payer 1 $ pour percevoir 0,35 $ \u00bb : motifs de la CCI au para. 77. En revanche, les activit\u00e9s relatives aux cartes de cr\u00e9dit de la Banque PC sont rentables : motifs de la CCI aux para. 73\u201376. \u00c0 premi\u00e8re vue, le raisonnement de la CCI semble convaincant. Cependant, un examen plus attentif permet d\u2019y relever une erreur de droit isolable. En mati\u00e8re de taxe de vente, contrairement au cas de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, la rentabilit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas d\u2019importance pour d\u00e9terminer si une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par actions exerce une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Le fait de tenir compte de facteurs qui n\u2019ont pas d\u2019importance pour l\u2019application d\u2019un crit\u00e8re juridique constitue une erreur de droit : Smith c. Canada, 2019 CAF 173 au para. 30.\n[50] Il ressort clairement des d\u00e9finitions des termes \u00ab activit\u00e9 commerciale \u00bb et \u00ab entreprise \u00bb figurant au paragraphe 123(1) que l\u2019activit\u00e9 d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par actions n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre rentable pour \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une \u00ab activit\u00e9 commerciale \u00bb :\nactivit\u00e9 commerciale Constituent des activit\u00e9s commerciales exerc\u00e9es par une personne [...] l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise (\u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019une entreprise exploit\u00e9e sans attente raisonnable de profit par un particulier, une fiducie personnelle ou une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de personnes dont l\u2019ensemble des associ\u00e9s sont des particuliers), sauf dans la mesure o\u00f9 [...] le projet ou l\u2019affaire comporte la r\u00e9alisation par la personne de fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es [...].\nentreprise Sont compris parmi les entreprises [...] toutes affaires quelconques avec ou sans but lucratif [...].\n[51] Dans la d\u00e9finition du terme \u00ab activit\u00e9 commerciale \u00bb au paragraphe 123(1), les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s par actions sont visiblement absentes de la liste des entit\u00e9s qui doivent avoir une attente raisonnable de profit. L\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada et la CCI ont reconnu que, en mati\u00e8re de taxe de vente, une attente raisonnable de profit n\u2019est pas une condition n\u00e9cessaire pour qu\u2019il y ait activit\u00e9 commerciale dans le cas de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s par actions : Traitement de d\u00e9chets JRG Inc. c. La Reine, 2009 CCI 67 au para. 82; Agence du revenu du Canada, \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de politique P-176R, \u00ab Application du crit\u00e8re de profit \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise \u00bb (30 septembre 1998).\n[52] La CCI a donc commis une erreur de droit en concluant que la participation de la Banque PC au programme de fid\u00e9lisation ne pouvait pas constituer une activit\u00e9 commerciale simplement parce que cette participation n\u2019offrait aucune attente raisonnable de profit \u00e0 la Banque PC.\nC. La Banque PC effectue le paiement de rachat dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale [53] Si les deux erreurs de droit susmentionn\u00e9es sont isol\u00e9es, les conclusions de fait de la CCI d\u00e9montrent que la Banque PC effectue le paiement de rachat dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale consistant \u00e0 accro\u00eetre les ventes au d\u00e9tail de Loblaws.\n[54] Selon la d\u00e9finition du mot \u00ab entreprise \u00bb de la Loi, reproduite au paragraphe 50, \u00ab [s]ont compris parmi les entreprises [...] toutes affaires quelconques avec ou sans but lucratif [...] \u00bb.\n[55] Nul ne conteste le fait que l\u2019activit\u00e9 de la Banque PC consistant \u00e0 fournir des services financiers constitue une entreprise.\n[56] Il ressort des conclusions de fait tir\u00e9es par la CCI concernant les accords qui sont \u00e0 la base du programme de fid\u00e9lisation que la Banque PC exploite une autre entreprise. Du fait qu\u2019elle est partie \u00e0 ces accords, la Banque PC participe \u00e0 un programme qui vise \u00e0 attirer des clients vers les magasins Loblaws : motifs de la CCI aux para. 7 (citant les paragraphes 7\u201318 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint partiel des faits), 78\u201380, 84. Le contrat de licence conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la Banque PC une licence lui permettant de donner des points de fid\u00e9lisation aux titulaires de sa carte de cr\u00e9dit : motifs de la CCI au para. 43. De plus, aux termes du contrat de licence, la Banque PC \u00ab reconna\u00eet qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de titulaire de licence, elle est responsable du [paiement de rachat] \u00bb : motifs de la CCI au para. 7, citant le paragraphe 16b de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint partiel des faits. La CCI a conclu que la Banque PC tire des revenus de sa participation au programme de fid\u00e9lisation : motifs de la CCI au para. 67. Elle gagne 0,75 cents pour les points de fid\u00e9lisation qu\u2019elle donne lorsque les titulaires de carte de cr\u00e9dit d\u00e9pensent 1 $ dans un magasin Loblaws, et 0,35 $ par tranche de points ayant une valeur nominale de 1 $ que les titulaires de carte de cr\u00e9dit utilisent dans des magasins Loblaws : motifs de la CCI au para. 7, citant les paragraphes 18a\u2013b de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint partiel des faits. Dans ce contexte, je ne puis que conclure que, du fait qu\u2019elle est partie aux accords \u00e0 la base du programme de fid\u00e9lisation, la Banque PC exploite une entreprise consistant \u00e0 attirer des clients vers les magasins Loblaws (l\u2019entreprise consistant \u00e0 attirer des clients).\n[57] Cette conclusion trouve \u00e9galement appui dans la comparaison que fait la CCI des revenus que tire la Banque PC de ses activit\u00e9s financi\u00e8res et des revenus qu\u2019elle tire du programme de fid\u00e9lisation. Par cette comparaison, la CCI reconna\u00eet que la Banque PC exploite deux entreprises.\n[58] Il est ind\u00e9niable que la Banque PC effectue le paiement de rachat dans le cadre de son activit\u00e9 de prestation de services financiers.\n[59] Cela dit, et comme je le mentionne plus haut, le paragraphe 181(5) n\u2019exige pas que le paiement de rachat soit effectu\u00e9 \u00ab exclusivement \u00bb ou \u00ab principalement \u00bb dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. La Banque PC effectue \u00e9galement le paiement de rachat dans le cadre de son activit\u00e9 commerciale, \u00e0 savoir son entreprise consistant \u00e0 accro\u00eetre les ventes au d\u00e9tail de Loblaws. En effet, l\u2019accord sur les paiements relatifs au programme de fid\u00e9lisation pr\u00e9voit que la Banque PC doit faire le paiement de rachat \u00e0 Loblaws pour chaque tranche de points de fid\u00e9lisation \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 1,00 $ que les titulaires de carte de cr\u00e9dit utilisent. Il s\u2019ensuit que, lorsque la Banque PC effectue le paiement de rachat, elle les fait dans le cadre de son entreprise consistant \u00e0 accro\u00eetre les ventes et donc dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale, comme l\u2019exige le paragraphe 181(5). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, notre Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que des services de promotion et de mise en march\u00e9 qui attirent un plus grand nombre de clients vers une entreprise constituent une fourniture taxable, ce qui signifie que de tels services sont fournis dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale : Banque canadienne imp\u00e9riale de commerce c. Canada, 2021 CAF 96 aux para. 15, 30, 67.\n[60] Comme la Banque PC effectue le paiement de rachat dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales, elle a le droit de demander des CTI fictifs. Cette issue est compatible avec l\u2019objectif du l\u00e9gislateur consistant \u00e0 all\u00e9ger la taxe per\u00e7ue en trop lorsque des paiements de rachat sont effectu\u00e9s dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale.\nVI. Conclusion [61] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens devant notre Cour et la cour de premi\u00e8re instance, et j\u2019annulerais le jugement de la CCI. Rendant le jugement que la CCI aurait d\u00fb rendre, j\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par la Banque PC des avis de nouvelle cotisation du 26 mars 2014 (pour la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9claration annuelle commen\u00e7ant le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2008 et se terminant le 30 d\u00e9cembre 2009) et du 23 juin 2015 (pour les p\u00e9riodes de d\u00e9claration annuelles se terminant les 30 d\u00e9cembre 2010, 30 d\u00e9cembre 2011 et 30 d\u00e9cembre 2012) et je renverrais les nouvelles cotisations \u00e0 la ministre pour qu\u2019elle en \u00e9tablisse de nouvelles au motif que la Banque PC a le droit de demander des CTI fictifs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des paiements de rachat qu\u2019elle effectue.\n\u00ab Nathalie Goyette \u00bb\nj.c.a.\n\u00ab Je suis d\u2019accord.\nJ.B. Laskin, j.c.a. \u00bb\nLE JUGE WEBB (motifs dissidents)\n[62] Dans le pr\u00e9sent appel, la question \u00e0 trancher est celle de savoir si la Banque le Choix du Pr\u00e9sident (la Banque PC) avait droit aux cr\u00e9dits fictifs de taxe sur les intrants (CTI fictifs) comme le pr\u00e9voit le paragraphe 181(5) de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, L.R.C. (1985), ch. E-15 (la LTA), lorsqu\u2019elle a rembours\u00e9 Loblaws Inc. (Loblaws) apr\u00e8s que les titulaires de carte de cr\u00e9dit de la Banque PC ont \u00e9chang\u00e9 les points re\u00e7us de la Banque PC pour payer une fourniture taxable (qui n\u2019est pas une fourniture d\u00e9tax\u00e9e) effectu\u00e9e par Loblaws.\n[63] Pour avoir droit aux CTI fictifs, la Banque PC doit avoir fait le paiement de rachat dont il est question ci-dessus dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales. La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (la CCI) a conclu que la Banque PC n\u2019avait pas effectu\u00e9 les paiements pr\u00e9vus au paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle n\u2019avait pas droit \u00e0 ces CTI fictifs (2022 CCI 84, le juge Hogan).\n[64] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je rejetterais le pr\u00e9sent appel.\nVII. Contexte [65] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la CCI cite plusieurs passages de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint partiel des faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par les parties \u00e0 l\u2019audience qu\u2019elle a tenue. Bien que plusieurs questions aient \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es devant la CCI, la seule question soulev\u00e9e dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent appel porte sur les CTI fictifs pr\u00e9vus au paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA. Par cons\u00e9quent, seuls les faits pertinents \u00e0 cette question seront \u00e9nonc\u00e9s.\n[66] La Banque PC est une filiale \u00e0 cent pour cent indirecte de Loblaws. Elle figure \u00e0 l\u2019annexe I de la Loi sur les banques, L.C. 1991, ch. 46, et est une institution financi\u00e8re d\u00e9sign\u00e9e aux fins de l\u2019application de la LTA. Elle est \u00e9galement inscrite pour l\u2019application de la partie IX de la LTA\n[67] La Banque PC \u00e9met des cartes de cr\u00e9dit MasterCard de la marque le Choix du Pr\u00e9sident (MasterCard PC) \u00e0 ses clients (titulaires de carte de cr\u00e9dit). Les titulaires de carte de cr\u00e9dit utilisent leur carte pour faire des achats et obtenir des avances de fonds.\n[68] Le 1er mars 2008, Services le Choix du Pr\u00e9sident inc. (SCPI), une filiale indirecte de Loblaws, a acquis le programme de fid\u00e9lisation de la Banque PC. En vertu du contrat de licence rectifi\u00e9, SCPI a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la Banque PC une licence non exclusive libre de redevances lui permettant de donner des points \u00e0 ses clients (points de fid\u00e9lisation). La Banque PC a reconnu qu\u2019elle serait responsable du rachat des points de fid\u00e9lisation. Dans le cadre du programme de fid\u00e9lisation, les titulaires de carte de cr\u00e9dit de la Banque PC re\u00e7oivent des points de fid\u00e9lisation lorsqu\u2019ils utilisent leur MasterCard PC. Ils obtiennent 20 points de fid\u00e9lisation pour chaque dollar d\u00e9pens\u00e9 dans un magasin Loblaws o\u00f9 des produits le Choix du Pr\u00e9sident sont vendus et 10 points de fid\u00e9lisation pour chaque dollar d\u00e9pens\u00e9 ailleurs (paragraphe 15 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint partiel des faits, cit\u00e9 au paragraphe 7 des motifs du juge de la CCI).\n[69] Les points de fid\u00e9lisation peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9chang\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 payer des achats effectu\u00e9s dans des magasins Loblaws (y compris certains magasins appartenant \u00e0 une filiale de Loblaws et certaines franchises exploit\u00e9es sous une marque de commerce que poss\u00e8de ou contr\u00f4le Loblaws).\n[70] L\u2019accord sur les paiements relatifs au programme de fid\u00e9lisation conclu entre la Banque PC, SCPI et Loblaws, dans sa version rectifi\u00e9e, pr\u00e9voit les paiements suivants (\u00e9nonc\u00e9s au paragraphe 18 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint partiel des faits) :\n[traduction]\na. pour chaque achat d\u2019une valeur de 1$ effectu\u00e9 par des titulaires de carte \u00e0 l\u2019aide de leur carte MasterCard de la Banque PC dans des magasins Loblaws o\u00f9 la Banque PC attribue aux titulaires de cette carte des points de fid\u00e9lisation, Loblaws verse 0,0075 $ \u00e0 la Banque PC;\nb. lorsqu\u2019un titulaire de carte MasterCard de la Banque PC \u00e9change des points de fid\u00e9lisation qu\u2019il a accumul\u00e9s avec cette carte, Loblaws verse \u00e0 la Banque PC 0,35 $ par tranche de points ayant une valeur nominale de 1 $; et\nc. lorsqu\u2019un titulaire de carte MasterCard de la Banque PC \u00e9change des points de fid\u00e9lisation qu\u2019il a accumul\u00e9s avec cette carte, la Banque PC verse \u00e0 Loblaws 1 $ par tranche de points ayant une valeur nominale de 1 $ (le \u00ab paiement de rachat \u00bb).\n[71] Les CTI fictifs en cause dans le pr\u00e9sent appel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9s par suite des paiements de rachat, tels qu\u2019ils sont d\u00e9crits au point c. ci-dessus.\nVIII. Paragraphes 181(1), (2) et (5) de la LTA [72] Le paragraphe 181(1) de la LTA renferme les d\u00e9finitions de certains termes utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 181. Le paragraphe 181(2) pr\u00e9voit les r\u00e8gles pour calculer la taxe lorsqu\u2019un bon est utilis\u00e9. Le CTI fictif auquel a droit une personne qui rembourse un d\u00e9taillant ayant accept\u00e9 un bon est payable conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA. Le libell\u00e9 complet de ces dispositions est reproduit \u00e0 l\u2019annexe des pr\u00e9sents motifs.\n[73] Au paragraphe 17, le juge de la CCI a repris l\u2019exemple suivant, donn\u00e9 par la Couronne et retenu par la Banque PC, pour illustrer le fonctionnement du paragraphe 181(2) de la LTA :\n[traduction]\n38. Consid\u00e9rons, par exemple, un client qui utilise un bon de r\u00e9duction remboursable de 1 $ lors de l\u2019achat d\u2019une bouteille de shampoing de 10 $, avant la TVH de 15 %, chez un d\u00e9taillant :\nPrix du shampoing 10,00 $\nTVH de 15 % 1,50 $\nTotal partiel 11,50 $\nMoins le bon (1,00 $)\nLe client paie 10,50 $\n39. Dans cet exemple, l\u2019inscrit (le d\u00e9taillant) est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir per\u00e7u la TVH de 1,50 $ en application du paragraphe 181(2) de la Loi. Il doit d\u00e9clarer et verser la TVH de 1,50 $.\n40. Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 181(2)c), en revanche, l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur (le client) ne peut pas demander un CTI de 1,50 $. La taxe payable par l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre la taxe percevable par l\u2019inscrit (en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, 1,50 $) moins la fraction de taxe de la valeur du bon (en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, 1 $ \u00f7 1,15 = 0,13 $). Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur peut demander un [cr\u00e9dit de taxe sur intrant] de 1,37 $, si l\u2019achat satisfait au paragraphe 169(1) de la Loi.\n[74] Bien que l\u2019exemple pr\u00e9sente le bon r\u00e9sultat pour le montant de la fraction de taxe de la valeur du bon (0,13 $), on ne parvient pas \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat en divisant 1,00 $ par 1,15 (ce qui donnerait 0,87 $). La fraction de taxe, telle qu\u2019elle est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019expression \u00ab fraction de taxe \u00bb \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au paragraphe 181(1) de la LTA, est calcul\u00e9e en divisant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\na)la somme du taux fix\u00e9 au paragraphe 165(1) (actuellement 5 %) et du taux de taxe applicable \u00e0 la province participante (10 % dans le pr\u00e9sent exemple)\npar\nb)la somme de 100 % et du pourcentage d\u00e9termin\u00e9 selon le paragraphe a) ci-dessus :\n(5 % + 10 %) \/ (115 %) = 15\/115 = 0,13 (ou 13 %)\n[75] Comme l\u2019indique la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019expression \u00ab fraction de taxe \u00bb, le r\u00e9sultat du calcul de la fraction de taxe est une fraction, et non un montant d\u2019argent. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le bon de l\u2019exemple ci\u2011dessus vaut 1,00 $, le montant de la fraction de taxe de la valeur du bon correspondrait \u00e0 13 % de 1,00 $ ou \u00e0 0,13 $.\n[76] Le paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA permet \u00e0 la personne qui rembourse le d\u00e9taillant pour le montant du bon de recouvrer sous forme de CTI fictif le montant de la fraction de taxe de la valeur du bon (0,13 $ dans l\u2019exemple donn\u00e9 ci-dessus), pourvu que les conditions impos\u00e9es par le paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA soient remplies.\n[77] La seule question en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent appel est li\u00e9e au droit de la Banque PC \u00e0 des CTI fictifs. Le calcul du montant total des CTI fictifs n\u2019est pas en litige.\nIX. D\u00e9cision de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t [78] La seule condition impos\u00e9e par le paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA qui \u00e9tait en litige dans l\u2019appel devant la CCI soulevait la question de savoir si la Banque PC avait vers\u00e9 les paiements de rachat \u00e0 Loblaws dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales (paragraphe 9 des motifs du juge de la CCI). Au paragraphe 9, le juge de la CCI a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nSi la Banque PC a vers\u00e9 le paiement de rachat dans le cadre d\u2019un \u00ab service financier \u00bb exon\u00e9r\u00e9, le paiement de rachat ne peut pas alors avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 \u00ab dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales \u00bb, car la d\u00e9finition du terme \u00ab activit\u00e9 commerciale \u00bb exclut express\u00e9ment les fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es. La Banque PC n\u2019a le droit de demander des CTI fictifs en application du paragraphe 181(5) de la Loi que si le paiement de rachat a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 dans le cadre de ses \u00ab activit\u00e9s commerciales \u00bb.\n[79] Au paragraphe 10 de ses motifs, le juge de la CCI a soulign\u00e9 que, \u00e0 l\u2019audience, la Banque PC soutenait qu\u2019\u00ab elle a vers\u00e9 les paiements de rachat lors de l\u2019exploitation du programme de fid\u00e9lisation, ce qui, selon elle, constitue une activit\u00e9 commerciale \u00bb. Le juge de la CCI a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 que, \u00ab [s]elon la Banque [PC], il n\u2019y a aucune raison de conclure que le paiement de rachat a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une autre activit\u00e9 (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019entreprise des cartes MasterCard de la Banque [PC]) \u00bb.\n[80] Le juge de la CCI a examin\u00e9 les d\u00e9finitions des expressions \u00ab activit\u00e9 commerciale \u00bb, \u00ab fourniture exon\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00bb et \u00ab service financier \u00bb. Nul ne conteste que les activit\u00e9s de la Banque PC li\u00e9es aux cartes de cr\u00e9dit MasterCard sont des services financiers et que, par cons\u00e9quent, la Banque PC r\u00e9alise des fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es dans le cadre de l\u2019exercice de ces activit\u00e9s.\n[81] Le juge de la CCI a conclu que les d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures traitant du paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA ne fournissaient pas d\u2019indications importantes relativement \u00e0 la question pertinente de l\u2019appel. Aucune des parties ne conteste cette conclusion dans l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 devant notre Cour.\n[82] Dans son examen de l\u2019expression \u00ab dans le cadre de \u00bb, le juge de la CCI a conclu que cette expression avait un sens large. Au paragraphe 29 de ses motifs, il a cit\u00e9 les passages suivants tir\u00e9s de la d\u00e9cision Midland Hutterian Brethren c. Canada, 2000 CanLII 16725 (CAF), [2000] A.C.F. no 2098 (Midland Hutterian Brethren) :\nNotre Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ces mots et conclu que lorsqu\u2019un inscrit paie la TPS par rapport \u00e0 ses activit\u00e9s commerciales, il a droit \u00e0 un CTI. Comme l\u2019explique le juge Stone, J.C.A., dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Metropolitan Toronto Hockey League c. Canada, [[1995] A.C.F. no 944] :\nL\u2019\u00e9conomie de la Loi permet \u00e0 une entreprise de demander le remboursement de la taxe qu\u2019elle a pay\u00e9e sur l\u2019achat de biens ou de services li\u00e9s \u00e0 la vente de ses fournitures imposables ou de r\u00e9clamer un cr\u00e9dit [de taxe] \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. De cette mani\u00e8re, la taxe est finalement pay\u00e9e uniquement par l\u2019acheteur non commercial ultime de la fourniture imposable.\nLorsque le juge Stone a utilis\u00e9 les mots \u00ab li\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00bb pour expliquer le texte de la loi, il voulait indiquer que les fournitures doivent contribuer \u00e0 la production d\u2019articles ou \u00e0 la fourniture de services qui sont [taxables]. Quelque chose comme une cigarette, consomm\u00e9e au moment o\u00f9 on se livre \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale, ne pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e [comme] li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale, puisqu\u2019elle ne contribue pas \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale qui en fin de compte produira des fournitures [taxables].\nRien dans la r\u00e9daction du paragraphe 169(1) ne vient indiquer que l\u2019utilisation en cause doit \u00eatre exclusivement commerciale, non plus que faire une distinction entre les biens achet\u00e9s pour utilisation directe et ceux qui sont achet\u00e9s et modifi\u00e9s avant d\u2019\u00eatre utilis\u00e9s dans les activit\u00e9s commerciales. Une fois qu\u2019un article est jug\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis et utilis\u00e9 dans le cadre des activit\u00e9s commerciales d\u2019un inscrit \u00e0 la TPS, et que cet article contribue directement ou indirectement \u00e0 la production d\u2019articles ou \u00e0 la fourniture de services [taxables], il y a alors un droit au CTI en vertu de la formule \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au paragraphe 169(1). Tout abus peut \u00eatre circonscrit en exigeant une preuve de l\u2019utilisation pr\u00e9vue et en ajustant le pourcentage du CTI accord\u00e9 par le ministre.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[83] Le juge de la CCI a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9, au paragraphe 32, que, lorsqu\u2019une personne exploite une entreprise qui consiste dans la r\u00e9alisation de fournitures taxables et une entreprise qui consiste dans la r\u00e9alisation de fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es, cette derni\u00e8re est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 part de l\u2019autre entreprise, comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat 398722 Alberta Ltd. c. Canada, 2000 CanLII 15331 (CAF). [2000] A.C.F. no 644 :\n[22] Toute entreprise peut consister en plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments, dont chacun fait partie int\u00e9grante de l\u2019ensemble. La d\u00e9finition d\u2019\u00ab activit\u00e9 commerciale \u00bb prend en compte cette possibilit\u00e9 mais pose, aux fins de la TPS, que tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l\u2019entreprise qui consiste dans la r\u00e9alisation de fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 part. Par application de cette d\u00e9finition l\u00e9gale, l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est pas une \u00ab activit\u00e9 commerciale \u00bb dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle consiste dans la location des unit\u00e9s d\u2019habitation du quadruplex. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je conviens avec la Couronne que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 un cr\u00e9dit de taxe sur [les] intrants pour compenser la TPS payable sur les biens et services acquis \u00e0 titre de fourniture \u00e0 soi-m\u00eame pour le quadruplex.\n[84] Le juge de la CCI a examin\u00e9 l\u2019historique du programme de points (\u00e9galement appel\u00e9 programme de fid\u00e9lisation) et les accords pertinents : le contrat de licence, l\u2019accord sur les services de fid\u00e9lisation rectifi\u00e9 et l\u2019accord sur les frais de fid\u00e9lisation rectifi\u00e9. Il a \u00e9galement tenu compte des t\u00e9moignages des t\u00e9moins.\n[85] Voici les principales constatations du juge de la CCI :\n[65] [...] je souscris \u00e0 la th\u00e8se de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle la Banque PC devait verser \u00e0 Loblaws les paiements de rachat dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 la carte MasterCard. La Banque PC a attribu\u00e9 aux titulaires de carte les points de fid\u00e9lisation pour les r\u00e9compenser d\u2019avoir effectu\u00e9 des achats \u00e0 l\u2019aide de ces cartes MasterCard PC.\n[66] Il faut trancher la question en litige en l\u2019examinant du point de vue de la Banque PC, une entit\u00e9 juridique distincte soumise aux \u00e0 la TPS relativement \u00e0 ses intrants, \u00e0 ses d\u00e9penses de rachat et \u00e0 ses fournitures. Cela ressort clairement du passage du paragraphe 181(5) de la Loi qui dispose \u00ab qu\u2019une autre personne [la Banque PC] verse dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales un montant \u00bb. Il faut examiner les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour \u00e9tablir le motif ou la cause des versements du paiement de rachat. Autrement dit, le paiement de rachat est-il li\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation par la Banque PC de fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es ou taxables?\n[67] \u00c0 mon avis, les paiements de rachat ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s dans le cadre des activit\u00e9s de la Banque PC li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa carte MasterCard, qui comprennent la fourniture exon\u00e9r\u00e9e de services financiers aux titulaires de carte. La Banque PC a donn\u00e9 des points de fid\u00e9lisation pour tirer un revenu important des cartes MasterCard. Les revenus importants que la Banque PC a tir\u00e9s des commissions d\u2019interchange sont d\u00e9risoires [sic] par rapport aux revenus qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7us de Loblaws. La Banque PC est une entit\u00e9 juridique tr\u00e8s r\u00e9put\u00e9e autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 poursuivre certaines op\u00e9rations bancaires en vue de r\u00e9aliser un profit. Je trouve inconcevable que la Banque PC ait effectu\u00e9 les paiements de rachat dans le but de perdre de l\u2019argent.\n[...]\n[73] L\u2019entreprise de la Banque PC consiste \u00e0 tirer un profit d\u2019une entreprise rentable de cartes de cr\u00e9dit. M\u00eame si on ne consulte que les \u00e9tats financiers consolid\u00e9s (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire ceux de LCL), les renseignements sur les services financiers (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la Banque PC) portent sur la rentabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019entreprise de cartes de cr\u00e9dit de la Banque PC. Elle tire la quasi-totalit\u00e9 de son revenu net de cette activit\u00e9. Je suis d\u2019avis que la Banque PC a obtenu le droit de donner aux titulaires de carte des points de fid\u00e9lisation afin, en premier lieu, de les inciter \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir sa carte MasterCard, puis de les encourager \u00e0 utiliser leur carte MasterCard.\n[...]\n[82] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, le paragraphe 181(5) de la Loi vise directement la Banque PC. Pourquoi la Banque PC verse-t-elle le paiement de rachat? Apr\u00e8s examen de la preuve testimoniale, mon avis reste le m\u00eame. La Banque PC a \u00e9mis les points de fid\u00e9lisation pour inciter les clients \u00e0 souscrire \u00e0 sa carte MasterCard, puis surtout \u00e0 l\u2019utiliser. Cela visait \u00e0 faire cro\u00eetre les activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 la carte MasterCard de la Banque PC. La Banque PC a vers\u00e9 le paiement de rachat de points de fid\u00e9lisation en contrepartie de l\u2019\u00e9mission des points de fid\u00e9lisation.\n[86] Au paragraphe 85, le juge de la CCI a conclu que la Banque PC effectuait les paiements de rachat dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation de son entreprise de services financiers et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait donc pas droit aux CTI fictifs en application du paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA.\nX. Question en litige et norme de contr\u00f4le [87] Dans son m\u00e9moire, la Banque PC a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\n29. La question \u00e0 trancher dans le pr\u00e9sent appel est de savoir si le juge de la CCI a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019expression \u00ab dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales \u00bb figurant au paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA.\n30. Le juge de la CCI a omis d\u2019effectuer une interpr\u00e9tation textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique, et a commis une erreur dans son interpr\u00e9tation de la disposition \u00e0 trois \u00e9gards :\n(a) Il a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le libell\u00e9 de la disposition, qui ne requiert pas que la Banque PC effectue le paiement de rachat \u00ab exclusivement \u00bb ou \u00ab principalement \u00bb dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale.\n(b) Il s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur le fait que l\u2019activit\u00e9 principale de la Banque PC est son entreprise de cartes de cr\u00e9dit, m\u00eame si l\u2019activit\u00e9 principale du contribuable n\u2019est pas une consid\u00e9ration pertinente dans le cadre du paragraphe 181(5);\n(c) Il s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur le fait que la Banque PC tire des profits de ses activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es aux cartes de cr\u00e9dit, mais pas de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales avec Loblaws, ce qui n\u2019est pas non plus une consid\u00e9ration pertinente dans le cadre du paragraphe 181(5).\n[88] Lors de l\u2019audience du pr\u00e9sent appel, la Banque PC a reformul\u00e9 les questions ainsi :\na)L\u2019expression \u00ab dans le cadre de \u00bb ne constitue pas un crit\u00e8re imposant un test de \u00ab soit l\u2019une soit l\u2019autre \u00bb;\nb)L\u2019expression \u00ab activit\u00e9 commerciale \u00bb ne requiert aucune attente de profit pour les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s par actions; et\nc)L\u2019\u00ab activit\u00e9 principale \u00bb de la Banque PC ne d\u00e9termine pas son droit aux CTI fictifs en application du paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA.\n[89] Bien que la Banque PC ait \u00e9galement fait valoir qu\u2019elle avait droit aux CTI fictifs sur le fondement de son interpr\u00e9tation correcte du paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA, la conclusion selon laquelle la Banque PC a droit aux CTI fictifs ne devra \u00eatre examin\u00e9e que si les arguments de la Banque PC concernant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation correcte du paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA sont retenus.\n[90] La Banque PC ne conteste aucune des conclusions de fait du juge de la CCI. La seule question en litige concerne l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA et en est une de droit. La norme de contr\u00f4le applicable est donc celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte (Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33).\nXI. Analyse [91] L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur une analyse textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique (Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco Canada c. Canada, 2005 CSC 54 au para. 10). La question de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation est ax\u00e9e sur l\u2019extrait suivant, qui est tir\u00e9 du paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA :\n[...] une autre personne verse dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales un montant au fournisseur pour racheter le bon [...]\n[92] Ce passage, qui met l\u2019accent sur le paiement d\u2019un montant dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale, est unique au paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA. La Banque PC affirme qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pu trouver aucune autre disposition de la LTA utilisant ce libell\u00e9.\n[93] La Banque PC ne conteste pas la conclusion du juge de la CCI selon laquelle elle a effectu\u00e9 les paiements de rachat dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es aux cartes de cr\u00e9dit et qu\u2019elle les a donc effectu\u00e9s dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers. Elle soutient plut\u00f4t que la CCI a commis une erreur de droit en ne tenant pas compte du fait que les m\u00eames paiements de rachat ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale.\n[94] La Banque PC a formul\u00e9 la question en cause de la fa\u00e7on suivante : l\u2019expression \u00ab dans le cadre de \u00bb constitue-t-elle un crit\u00e8re qui impose un test de \u00ab soit l\u2019une soit l\u2019autre \u00bb? Elle soutient que, en plus d\u2019exploiter une entreprise de services financiers, elle exerce \u00e9galement une activit\u00e9 commerciale, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire le [traduction] \u00ab service consistant \u00e0 accro\u00eetre les ventes au d\u00e9tail de Loblaws \u00bb (paragraphe 62 du m\u00e9moire de la Banque PC). Le juge de la CCI, au paragraphe 10 de ses motifs, a indiqu\u00e9 que la Banque PC avait d\u00e9fini son activit\u00e9 commerciale ainsi : \u00ab Selon la th\u00e8se de la Banque [PC], elle a vers\u00e9 les paiements de rachat lors de l\u2019exploitation du programme de fid\u00e9lisation, ce qui, selon elle, constitue une activit\u00e9 commerciale \u00bb. Au paragraphe 78, le juge de la CCI a \u00e9galement reconnu que Mme Davis, chef de la direction financi\u00e8re des Compagnies Loblaw Limit\u00e9e, au moment pertinent du pr\u00e9sent appel, avait \u00ab insist\u00e9 sur le fait que l\u2019objectif principal du programme de fid\u00e9lisation \u00e9tait [traduction] d\u2019\u201caccro\u00eetre les ventes au d\u00e9tail\u201d de Loblaws \u00bb.\n[95] Tel que susmentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 79, le juge de la CCI a expliqu\u00e9, au paragraphe 10 de ses motifs, que \u00ab [s]elon la Banque PC, il n\u2019y a aucune raison de conclure que le paiement de rachat a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une autre activit\u00e9 (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire l\u2019entreprise des cartes MasterCard de la Banque PC) \u00bb. Comme la Banque PC soutenait que les paiements de rachat avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s uniquement dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale, son argument selon lequel les paiements de rachat pouvaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s \u00e0 la fois dans le cadre de l\u2019exercice d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers et dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale ne semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience devant la CCI.\n[96] L\u2019argument de la Banque PC concernant son activit\u00e9 commerciale (le \u00ab service consistant \u00e0 accro\u00eetre les ventes au d\u00e9tail de Loblaws \u00bb) est fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9tablissement par le ministre du Revenu national d\u2019une cotisation de taxe sous le r\u00e9gime de la LTA \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des paiements d\u00e9crits aux points a. et b. du paragraphe 18 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint partiel des faits, comme il est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 au paragraphe 70 des pr\u00e9sents motifs :\n[traduction]\na. pour chaque achat d\u2019une valeur de 1 $ effectu\u00e9 par des titulaires de carte \u00e0 l\u2019aide de leur carte MasterCard de la Banque PC dans des magasins Loblaws o\u00f9 la Banque PC attribue aux titulaires de cette carte des points de fid\u00e9lisation, Loblaws verse 0,0075 $ \u00e0 la Banque PC;\nb. lorsqu\u2019un titulaire de carte MasterCard \u00e9change des points de fid\u00e9lisation qu\u2019il a accumul\u00e9s avec cette carte, Loblaws verse \u00e0 la Banque 0,35 $par tranche de points ayant une valeur nominale de 1 $;\n[...]\n[97] La Couronne conteste la th\u00e8se selon laquelle ces paiements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Toutefois, la taxe pr\u00e9vue par la LTA ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019aux fournitures taxables (paragraphe 165(1) de la LTA), qui sont des fournitures effectu\u00e9es dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale (d\u00e9finition du terme \u00ab fourniture taxable \u00bb au paragraphe 123(1) de la LTA). La question de savoir si la taxe aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 ces paiements n\u2019est pas en cause dans le pr\u00e9sent appel. Aux fins du pr\u00e9sent appel, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la taxe a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e, je supposerai qu\u2019elle l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement et, par cons\u00e9quent, que la Banque PC exer\u00e7ait une activit\u00e9 commerciale, en plus de son entreprise de services financiers. La question de savoir si les paiements de rachat ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s dans le cadre de cette activit\u00e9 commerciale est une question mixte de fait et de droit distincte.\n[98] La question \u00e0 trancher est de savoir si la Banque PC a vers\u00e9 les paiements de rachat \u00e0 Loblaws dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales, et non si elle a acquis un bien ou un service donn\u00e9 pour consommation, utilisation ou fourniture dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales (comme ce serait le cas pour le calcul du CTI, en application du paragraphe 169(1) de la LTA, lorsqu\u2019une personne acquiert un bien ou un service donn\u00e9). Lors de l\u2019audience du pr\u00e9sent appel, la Banque PC a confirm\u00e9 n\u2019avoir acquis aucun bien ni service \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des paiements de rachat. Bien que la Banque PC ait fait valoir que son activit\u00e9 commerciale \u00e9tait le \u00ab service consistant \u00e0 accro\u00eetre les ventes au d\u00e9tail de Loblaws \u00bb, elle a affirm\u00e9 ne pas avoir vers\u00e9 les paiements de rachat \u00e0 Loblaws afin d\u2019accro\u00eetre les ventes au d\u00e9tail de Loblaws, mais plut\u00f4t afin d\u2019acquitter un montant dont elle \u00e9tait redevable.\n[99] La question de savoir si les paiements de rachat ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale de la Banque PC est une question de fait ou une question mixte de fait et de droit, car l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de certains contrats est pertinente. Les juges majoritaires de notre Cour ont expliqu\u00e9 ce qui suit dans Midland Hutterian Brethren :\nLorsque le juge Stone a utilis\u00e9 les mots \u00ab li\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00bb pour expliquer le texte de la loi, il voulait indiquer que les fournitures doivent contribuer \u00e0 la production d\u2019articles ou \u00e0 la fourniture de services qui sont [taxables]. Quelque chose comme une cigarette, consomm\u00e9e au moment o\u00f9 on se livre \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale, ne pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale, puisqu\u2019elle ne contribue pas \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale qui en fin de compte produira des fournitures [taxables].\n[100] Dans Midland Hutterian Brethren, la Cour a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019un bien ou un service donn\u00e9 est acquis pour consommation ou utilisation dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale s\u2019il a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale. Quand l\u2019on applique ce principe pour d\u00e9terminer si une personne paie un montant dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale, il faut qu\u2019un tel paiement contribue \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la question est de savoir si les paiements de rachat ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale de la Banque PC, que cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9crit maintenant comme un \u00ab service consistant \u00e0 accro\u00eetre les ventes au d\u00e9tail de Loblaws \u00bb.\n[101] La question de savoir si les paiements de rachat faits \u00e0 Loblaws ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale de la Banque PC qualifi\u00e9e de \u00ab service consistant \u00e0 accro\u00eetre les ventes au d\u00e9tail de Loblaws \u00bb est une question de fait ou une question mixte de fait et de droit. Le juge de la CCI n\u2019a tir\u00e9 aucune conclusion de fait selon laquelle les paiements de rachat \u00e9taient effectu\u00e9s dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale de la Banque PC. Le juge de CCI a plut\u00f4t conclu, au paragraphe 72 de ses motifs, que \u00ab la Banque PC n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale pour laquelle elle a demand\u00e9 des CTI fictifs \u00bb, et, au paragraphe 76, que \u00ab [l]a Banque PC \u00e9met des points et paie leur prix de rachat [...] pour tirer un revenu de la fourniture de services financiers \u00bb.\n[102] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Banque PC n\u2019a contest\u00e9 aucune des conclusions de fait tir\u00e9es par le juge de la CCI, notamment celle selon laquelle \u00ab [l]a Banque PC n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale pour laquelle elle a demand\u00e9 des CTI fictifs \u00bb. La seule question soulev\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est la question de droit, que la Banque PC a formul\u00e9e comme celle du crit\u00e8re imposant un choix. La Banque PC fait valoir que le juge de la CCI, ayant conclu que les paiements de rachat \u00e9taient effectu\u00e9s dans le cadre d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers, a eu tort de ne pas se demander si elle versait aussi les m\u00eames montants dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Toutefois, comme la Banque PC n\u2019a contest\u00e9 aucune conclusion de fait dans l\u2019appel qu\u2019elle a interjet\u00e9, la conclusion de fait du juge de la CCI selon laquelle \u00ab [l]a Banque PC n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale pour laquelle elle a demand\u00e9 des CTI fictifs \u00bb est maintenue.\n[103] \u00c0 mon avis, pour que j\u2019examine la question juridique de savoir si les paiements de rachat ont pu \u00eatre effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 la fois dans le cadre d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers et dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale, il aurait fallu que la Banque PC \u00e9tablisse d\u2019abord, devant la CCI, dans le cadre de quelle activit\u00e9 commerciale pr\u00e9cise les paiements de rachat auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la conclusion de fait, selon laquelle la Banque PC n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale pr\u00e9cise en question, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e dans le pr\u00e9sent appel, il n\u2019est pas loisible \u00e0 la Banque PC de tenter, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u2019\u00e9tablir une conclusion de fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9tablie lors de l\u2019audience devant la CCI.\n[104] Cependant, comme susmentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 97, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que j\u2019estime que la Couronne ne peut pas faire valoir que la Banque PC n\u2019exer\u00e7ait aucune activit\u00e9 commerciale, j\u2019examinerai la question juridique de savoir si les paiements de rachat pouvaient \u00e0 la fois \u00eatre vers\u00e9s dans le cadre d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers et dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale.\n[105] La Banque PC a li\u00e9 cette question juridique \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019expression \u00ab dans le cadre de \u00bb. J\u2019estime toutefois que ce n\u2019est pas la question \u00e0 trancher. La question n\u2019est pas de savoir si l\u2019expression \u00ab dans le cadre de \u00bb a un sens large et si un bien ou un service acquis peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis pour utilisation dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers. La question \u00e0 trancher est plut\u00f4t de savoir si le versement du montant, au sens du paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA, pouvait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers et si ce m\u00eame versement pouvait aussi \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale.\n[106] Le paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA pr\u00e9voit le versement d\u2019un montant, mais pas l\u2019acquisition d\u2019un bien ou d\u2019un service donn\u00e9 :\n[...] une autre personne verse dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales un montant au fournisseur pour racheter le bon [...]\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[107] Pour illustrer l\u2019argument juridique de la Banque PC quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si le versement envisag\u00e9 au paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA pouvait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers, je supposerai que le montant d\u2019un paiement de rachat vers\u00e9 apr\u00e8s qu\u2019un client a \u00e9chang\u00e9 ses points de fid\u00e9lisation s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 10 $. La Banque PC soutient que ce montant de 10 $ peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et dans le cadre de son entreprise de services financiers. Comme je l\u2019explique plus en d\u00e9tail plus bas, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas de la bonne interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA.\n[108] La Banque PC a renvoy\u00e9 aux d\u00e9cisions Midland Hutterian Brethren, Canada c. General Motors du Canada Lt\u00e9e, 2009 CAF 114 (General Motors), et Glencore Canada Corporation v. Canada, 2024 FCA 3, autorisation de pourvoi \u00e0 la CSC refus\u00e9e, 41149 (8 ao\u00fbt 2024), (Glencore Canada), \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son interpr\u00e9tation selon laquelle un paiement pouvait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et dans le cadre d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers.\n[109] Les arr\u00eats Midland Hutterian Brethren et General Motors concernent tous deux le droit aux CTI aux termes du paragraphe 169(1) de la LTA. Le libell\u00e9 complet de cette disposition est reproduit \u00e0 l\u2019annexe jointe aux pr\u00e9sents motifs. Cette disposition pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une personne a droit \u00e0 un CTI pour un bien ou un service acquis pour consommation, utilisation ou fourniture dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales, et il pr\u00e9voit le montant du cr\u00e9dit qui peut \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9.\n[110] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le paragraphe 169(1) de la LTA pr\u00e9voit que des CTI ne peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9s que dans la mesure o\u00f9 le bien ou le service donn\u00e9 est acquis pour consommation, utilisation ou fourniture dans le cadre des activit\u00e9s commerciales de la personne. Cette restriction se refl\u00e8te dans la formule (A x B) \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au paragraphe 169(1) de la LTA. Selon l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la LTA, un bien ou un service donn\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 100 % dans l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise consistant \u00e0 effectuer des fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es et \u00e0 100 % dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Compte tenu de ce contexte, l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur ne pouvait \u00eatre, \u00e0 mon avis, que le paiement entier d\u2019un montant donn\u00e9 puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois dans le cadre d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers et dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale.\n[111] Midland Hutterian Brethren et General Motors ne traitent pas de la question de savoir si un paiement unique peut \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers. \u00c0 mon avis, il ne s\u2019ensuit pas n\u00e9cessairement que, parce que la LTA pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019un bien ou un service donn\u00e9 peut \u00eatre acquis pour utilisation dans le cadre de plus d\u2019une activit\u00e9, le l\u00e9gislateur envisageait que la personne paierait le montant entier du bien dans le cadre de chaque activit\u00e9.\n[112] \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, supposons qu\u2019une personne paie 100 $ pour acqu\u00e9rir un bien donn\u00e9 qui est utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 60 % dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et \u00e0 40 % dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers. Si l\u2019on reconna\u00eet que le bien est utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 60 % dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et \u00e0 40 % dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers, \u00e0 mon avis, il ne s\u2019ensuit pas n\u00e9cessairement que le l\u00e9gislateur envisageait que le montant de 100 $ serait vers\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et que ce montant serait \u00e9galement vers\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers.\n[113] Dans Glencore Canada, la question \u00e0 trancher \u00e9tait de savoir si un montant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab re\u00e7u par le contribuable pendant qu\u2019il tirait un revenu d\u2019une entreprise ou d\u2019un bien \u00bb pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 12(1)x) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C.

De plus, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Glencore Canada concernait une autre loi (la LIR plut\u00f4t que la LTA) et l\u2019inclusion d\u2019un montant de revenu aux fins de la LIR, cet arr\u00eat n\u2019est d\u2019aucune utilit\u00e9 pour d\u00e9cider si un paiement unique peut \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers pour l\u2019application du paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA.\n[114] Selon le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA, le versement du montant dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale est une condition \u00e0 remplir et que cette condition est soit respect\u00e9e, soit non respect\u00e9e :\n[...] une autre personne verse dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales un montant au fournisseur pour racheter le bon [...]\n[115] Le paragraphe 181(5) dispose \u00ab qu\u2019une autre personne \u00bb verse \u00ab un montant \u00bb et requiert l\u2019une des deux r\u00e9ponses suivantes :\nOui, la personne a vers\u00e9 le montant dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales; ou\nNon, la personne n\u2019a pas vers\u00e9 le montant dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales.\n[116] La condition pertinente du paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA met l\u2019accent sur le versement d\u2019un montant. Une personne ne verse un montant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019une seule fois. Elle ne le verse pas deux fois. Ayant conclu que la Banque PC a vers\u00e9 le montant total des paiements de rachat dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers, aucun montant, relativement aux paiements de rachat, ne pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une autre activit\u00e9.\n[117] \u00c0 mon avis, le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu mettre l\u2019accent sur l\u2019op\u00e9ration de paiement unique et la question de savoir si, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la personne verse le montant dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Si, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la personne verse le montant donn\u00e9 dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers, elle n\u2019a pas droit aux CTI fictifs. Dans le cas o\u00f9 deux activit\u00e9s sont possibles (p. ex. une activit\u00e9 commerciale et une entreprise de services financiers), la question que doit trancher la Cour est de savoir si, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la personne verse le montant donn\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale.\n[118] Un paiement unique pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant vers\u00e9 en partie dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et en partie dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers. Par exemple, un paiement de 10 $ pourrait \u00eatre r\u00e9parti en deux activit\u00e9s : 6 $ dans le cadre de l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale et 4 $ dans le cadre de l\u2019entreprise de services financiers. Cependant, tel n\u2019est pas l\u2019argument de la Banque PC. La Banque PC ne conteste pas le fait que, pour un paiement de rachat de 10 $, le montant de 10 $ a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation de son entreprise de services financiers. La Banque PC fait valoir que le paiement total de 10 $ (dans l\u2019exemple en question) serait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant vers\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers.\n[119] La d\u00e9finition de l\u2019expression \u00ab activit\u00e9 commerciale \u00bb pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 123(1) de la LTA est \u00e9galement pertinente. Le libell\u00e9 complet de cette disposition est reproduit \u00e0 l\u2019annexe jointe aux pr\u00e9sents motifs. L\u2019alin\u00e9a a) de la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019expression \u00ab activit\u00e9 commerciale \u00bb pr\u00e9voit que, dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019entreprise comporte la r\u00e9alisation de fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es, elle ne constitue pas une activit\u00e9 commerciale :\n[\u2026] l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise [...] sauf dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019entreprise comporte la r\u00e9alisation par la personne de fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es [...]\n[120] Une activit\u00e9 ne peut pas \u00eatre \u00e0 la fois une entreprise de fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es et une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Comme une activit\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre \u00e0 la fois une entreprise de fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es et une activit\u00e9 commerciale, il m\u2019appara\u00eet logique que le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019ait pas voulu qu\u2019un paiement unique puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es, telle qu\u2019une entreprise de services financiers.\n[121] Au paragraphe 48 de son m\u00e9moire, la Banque PC renvoie \u00e0 plusieurs dispositions de la LTA qui font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition d\u2019un bien ou d\u2019un service exclusivement ou principalement dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale :\n[traduction]\n48. Lorsque le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu limiter le recouvrement des CTI aux contribuables qui effectuent une fourniture ou un paiement \u00ab exclusivement \u00bb ou \u00ab principalement \u00bb dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale, il l\u2019a express\u00e9ment indiqu\u00e9. Par exemple, le paragraphe 202(2), qui r\u00e9git le recouvrement des CTI \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019acquisition d\u2019une voiture de tourisme ou d\u2019un a\u00e9ronef, pr\u00e9voit que la voiture de tourisme ou l\u2019a\u00e9ronef doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis par un particulier ou une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de personnes \u00ab pour utilisation exclusive \u00bb dans le cadre d\u2019activit\u00e9s commerciales. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 199(2)a), qui r\u00e9git le recouvrement des CTI \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019acquisition d\u2019immobilisations, permet le recouvrement des CTI \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des fournitures acquises en vue d\u2019\u00eatre utilis\u00e9es \u00ab principalement \u00bb dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. L\u2019article 141.02 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux intrants utilis\u00e9s \u00ab directement et exclusivement \u00bb dans le but d\u2019effectuer des fournitures taxables.\n[Soulignement de la Banque PC.]\n[122] Toutes ces dispositions font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation du bien ou du service acquis, et non au paiement d\u2019un montant unique.\n[123] Selon moi, il y a une distinction \u00e0 faire entre l\u2019acquisition d\u2019un bien ou d\u2019un service donn\u00e9 pour utilisation dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale ou d\u2019une autre activit\u00e9 et le paiement d\u2019un montant. Un bien donn\u00e9 peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 de multiples reprises dans diff\u00e9rentes activit\u00e9s, et un service peut \u00eatre rendu en partie dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 et en partie dans le cadre d\u2019une autre activit\u00e9. Un bien ou un service pouvait donc \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 principalement ou exclusivement dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 donn\u00e9e. \u00c0 mon avis, ces dispositions ne sont d\u2019aucune utilit\u00e9 pour la Banque PC.\n[124] La Banque PC fait valoir que, comme le paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA ne requiert pas [traduction] \u00ab qu\u2019une personne verse un montant exclusivement ou principalement \u00bb, le paiement en question peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers et dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Toutefois, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019expression \u00ab une autre personne verse dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales un montant \u00bb requiert que l\u2019on mette l\u2019accent sur le versement qui est effectu\u00e9 et que l\u2019on d\u00e9termine s\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale ou d\u2019une autre fa\u00e7on. Selon moi, ce libell\u00e9 n\u2019appuie pas la th\u00e8se selon laquelle un paiement unique (qui est effectu\u00e9 une seule fois) peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 deux fois : dans le cas qui nous occupe, une fois dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers et une autre fois dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale.\n[125] La personne verse un paiement unique une seule fois. Le r\u00e9gime de la LTA n\u2019envisage pas que la totalit\u00e9 (100 %) d\u2019un bien ou d\u2019un service acquis puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant utilis\u00e9e \u00e0 la fois dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et dans le cadre d\u2019une entreprise de fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es, et l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas que la totalit\u00e9 (100 %) d\u2019un paiement unique puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e \u00e0 la fois dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et d\u2019une entreprise de fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es.\n[126] Dans la d\u00e9cision Nestl\u00e9 Canada Inc. c. La Reine, 2017 CCI 33, la juge en chef adjointe Lamarre d\u00e9crit la politique sous-tendant le traitement des bons selon la LTA :\n[39] Le paragraphe 181(2) exige donc que le client paie un montant exc\u00e9dentaire de TPS\/TVH sur les produits de Nestl\u00e9 et il consid\u00e8re ensuite que le client n\u2019a pay\u00e9 la TPS\/TVH que sur le prix apr\u00e8s rabais. [...] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a expliqu\u00e9 les raisons de la mise en \u0153uvre de cette pratique dans ses observations orales, dans lesquelles il a invoqu\u00e9 devant la Cour les principes \u00e0 l\u2019origine du traitement des bons-rabais. La pratique avait pour but de simplifier le traitement des bons pour les petits \u00e9piciers qui, dans les ann\u00e9es 1990, n\u2019avaient pas facilement acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des caisses enregistreuses qui, pour la perception de la TPS\/TVH, pouvaient faire la distinction entre les bons applicables \u00e0 des fournitures taxables et les bons applicables \u00e0 des fournitures non taxables (ou d\u00e9tax\u00e9es).\n[40] La TPS\/TVH pay\u00e9e en trop n\u2019est toutefois pas destin\u00e9e au gouvernement. Le paragraphe 181(5) autorise plut\u00f4t le fournisseur du bon, Nestl\u00e9 en l\u2019occurrence, \u00e0 obtenir des CTI pour la TPS\/TVH pay\u00e9e en trop par le client de Costco.\n[127] Les r\u00e8gles relatives au traitement fiscal des bons ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en \u0153uvre afin de simplifier le processus pour les d\u00e9taillants, car ce ne sont pas tous les d\u00e9taillants qui avaient acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des caisses enregistreuses qui pouvaient traiter correctement les bons pour les fournitures taxables et les fournitures non taxables. On a \u00e9galement simplifi\u00e9 le m\u00e9canisme des CTI fictifs que pr\u00e9voit le paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA en n\u2019imposant plus le calcul proportionnel du paiement \u00e0 titre de remboursement effectu\u00e9 au d\u00e9taillant. Tous les paiements au titre des CTI fictifs seraient vers\u00e9s \u00e0 la personne qui paie le montant de rachat du bon dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale.\n[128] La r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale concernant les CTI pr\u00e9voit que ces cr\u00e9dits ne sont offerts que dans la mesure o\u00f9 un bien ou un service donn\u00e9 est acquis pour consommation, utilisation ou fourniture dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Si la personne acquiert un bien ou un service donn\u00e9 uniquement pour consommation, utilisation ou fourniture dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es, elle n\u2019aura pas droit au CTI. M\u00eame si aucun bien ou service n\u2019est acquis \u00e0 la suite du versement du paiement de rachat \u00e0 un d\u00e9taillant, comme le pr\u00e9voit le paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA, le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral selon lequel il existe un lien entre le droit \u00e0 un CTI et la mesure dans laquelle le montant est vers\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale devrait \u00eatre maintenu. \u00c0 mon avis, le l\u00e9gislateur ne voulait pas que la totalit\u00e9 des CTI fictifs soit vers\u00e9e \u00e0 la personne qui, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, ne verse pas le montant pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale.\n[129] Le l\u00e9gislateur voulait plut\u00f4t que les CTI fictifs soient octroy\u00e9s \u00e0 la personne qui, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, a vers\u00e9 le montant dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. La question de savoir si un montant donn\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale est une question de fait (ou une question mixte de fait et de droit dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019un contrat s\u2019applique).\n[130] \u00c0 mon avis, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet du paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA, la bonne interpr\u00e9tation est la suivante : lorsqu\u2019une personne exerce une activit\u00e9 commerciale et exploite une entreprise de services financiers, elle verse le montant pr\u00e9vu par ce paragraphe soit dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale, soit dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers. La personne ne verse un montant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019une seule fois, de sorte que, pour l\u2019application du paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA, elle paie ce montant soit dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale, soit dans le cadre d\u2019une autre activit\u00e9. Le montant total d\u2019un paiement unique ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale et dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers.\n[131] Comme l\u2019a reconnu la Banque PC, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les paiements de rachat ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s pour remplir une obligation de la Banque PC, la bonne question \u00e0 se poser est celle formul\u00e9e par le juge de la CCI au paragraphe 66 de ses motifs :\nIl faut examiner les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour \u00e9tablir les motifs ou la cause des versements du paiement de rachat. Autrement dit, le paiement de rachat est-il li\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation par la Banque PC de fournitures exon\u00e9r\u00e9es ou taxables?\n[132] Comme il a formul\u00e9 la bonne question, le juge de la CCI n\u2019a commis aucune erreur de droit. Ses conclusions de fait n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9es dans le pr\u00e9sent appel. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la principale conclusion qu\u2019il a tir\u00e9e au paragraphe 82 de ses motifs est d\u00e9terminante :\n[\u2026] La Banque PC a \u00e9mis les points de fid\u00e9lisation pour inciter les clients \u00e0 souscrire \u00e0 sa carte MasterCard, puis surtout \u00e0 l\u2019utiliser. Cela visait \u00e0 faire cro\u00eetre les activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 la carte MasterCard de la Banque PC. La Banque PC a vers\u00e9 les paiements de rachat de points de fid\u00e9lisation en contrepartie de l\u2019\u00e9mission des points de fid\u00e9lisation.\n[133] Les paiements de rachat que la Banque PC a vers\u00e9s \u00e0 Loblaws ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation de son entreprise de services financiers et non dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Banque PC n\u2019a pas droit aux CTI fictifs pr\u00e9vus au paragraphe 181(5) de la LTA relativement aux paiements de rachat.\n[134] Bien que la Banque PC soutienne que le juge de la CCI a eu tort de s\u2019appuyer sur les donn\u00e9es financi\u00e8res et l\u2019activit\u00e9 principale de la Banque PC, les donn\u00e9es financi\u00e8res et l\u2019activit\u00e9 principale de la Banque PC font partie de la trame factuelle dont le juge a tenu compte pour d\u00e9terminer si les paiements de rachat avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s dans le cadre d\u2019une activit\u00e9 commerciale ou de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de services financiers.

Mais plus important encore, il est bien \u00e9tabli que la simple preuve d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement n\u2019est pas suffisante pour faire valoir avec succ\u00e8s une d\u00e9fense de traitement discriminatoire; encore faut-il expliquer les raisons de cette diff\u00e9rence de traitement, lesquelles peuvent \u00eatre multiples (Bridgen c. Canada (Service correctionnel), 2014 CAF 237, 465 N. R. 73 au para. 59 (Bridgen), citant Canada v. Barrett, [1984] F.C.J. No. 249, 53 N. R. 60 au para. 25).\n[9] Or, ce fardeau incombait \u00e0 la demanderesse (Bridgen au para. 60). Toutefois, comme le souligne avec justesse le d\u00e9fendeur dans son m\u00e9moire, ce moyen de d\u00e9fense n\u2019apparaissait pas, devant la Commission, aussi essentiel \u00e0 la demanderesse qu\u2019elle le pr\u00e9tend maintenant. En effet, mis \u00e0 part une br\u00e8ve r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans la d\u00e9claration d\u2019ouverture, ni la preuve n\u00e9cessaire ni les autorit\u00e9s soumises par la demanderesse \u00e0 la Commission ne permettaient d\u2019\u00e9tayer une telle d\u00e9fense. Bien qu\u2019il e\u00fbt probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 souhaitable que la Commission en fasse \u00e9tat, ne serait-ce que bri\u00e8vement, le fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas senti besoin de le faire ne constitue pas, dans ces circonstances, une erreur justifiant l\u2019intervention de la Cour.\n[10] Je rappelle \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard que nous devons interpr\u00e9ter la d\u00e9cision de la Commission et les motifs qui la sous-tendent \u00ab en fonction de l\u2019historique et du contexte de l\u2019instance dans laquelle ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus \u00bb, ce qui comprend notamment, la preuve dont la Commission disposait (Vavilov au para. 94). L\u2019absence d\u2019une preuve cruciale \u2014 ici ce qui a pu motiver le fait qu\u2019aucune sanction n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise contre ce coll\u00e8gue de la demanderesse \u2014 \u00ab peut expliquer un aspect du raisonnement du d\u00e9cideur qui ne ressort pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence des motifs eux\u2011m\u00eames \u00bb (Vavilov au para. 94). On pourrait en dire autant du fait, tel que cela ressort aussi de la preuve au dossier, que ce coll\u00e8gue n\u2019\u00e9tait pas charg\u00e9, durant ce quart de travail, d\u2019effectuer exactement les m\u00eames fonctions que la demanderesse. Or, suivant la jurisprudence de la Commission et, plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les autorit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de droit du travail, une d\u00e9fense de traitement discriminatoire ne peut r\u00e9ussir, comme l\u2019\u00e9nonce la demanderesse elle-m\u00eame, que s\u2019il y a une parfaite ad\u00e9quation entre les deux situations (Donald J.M. Brown Q.C., David M. Beatty et Adam J. Beatty, Canadian Labour Arbitration, 5e ed, Thomson Reuters, 2019 (feuilles mobiles mises \u00e0 jour en 2023) \u00a7 7:70; Bridgen au para. 61-62; Ranu v. Deputy Head (Correctional Service of Canada), 2014 PSLRB 89 au para. 48). La preuve, ici, ne pointait pas dans cette direction.\n[11] En somme, vu l\u2019historique et le contexte de l\u2019instance dans laquelle la d\u00e9cision de la Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, l\u2019intelligibilit\u00e9 et la transparence de ladite d\u00e9cision n\u2019apparaissent pas affect\u00e9es par l\u2019absence de mention de la d\u00e9fense de traitement discriminatoire, du moins pas \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 l\u2019intervention de la Cour s\u2019imposerait.\n[12] Quant au deuxi\u00e8me moyen de contestation de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, li\u00e9 \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation du caract\u00e8re excessif de la sanction disciplinaire impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la demanderesse, je suis \u00e9galement d\u2019avis qu\u2019il ne peut r\u00e9ussir. Selon la demanderesse, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est d\u00e9raisonnable \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard puisque celle-ci a maintenu la mesure disciplinaire tout en, du m\u00eame souffle, l\u2019exon\u00e9rant de deux des quatre chefs d\u2019inconduite qui pesaient contre elle. Dans un tel contexte, dit-elle, une sanction moins lourde s\u2019imposait.\n[13] Dans l\u2019affaire Lloyd c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2016 CAF 115, 265 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1036 (Lloyd), une affaire pr\u00e9sentant des similitudes avec le pr\u00e9sent dossier, la Cour a statu\u00e9 que le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la mesure disciplinaire \u2014 dans ce cas une suspension de 40 jours \u2014 devait \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00ab \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des deux actes d\u2019inconduite qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis \u00bb (Lloyd au para. 23). Dans cette affaire, il y en avait (7) sept (Lloyd au para. 10). Or, c\u2019est exactement ce que la Commission a fait en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tant parfaitement consciente que l\u2019employeur n\u2019avait \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une partie de l\u2019inconduite all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (D\u00e9cision aux para. 191, 205).\n[14] La Commission, appliquant la grille d\u2019analyse ressortant de la jurisprudence de ce tribunal (D\u00e9cision au para. 193, citant Brazeau c. Administrateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics et des Services gouvernementaux), 2008 CRTFP 62), laquelle n\u2019est pas remise en cause ici, a jug\u00e9 que parmi tous les facteurs qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 soupeser, celui de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019infraction au regard des politiques de l\u2019employeur et de ses obligations \u00e9tait le plus important en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (D\u00e9cision au para. 201). Selon la Commission, la gravit\u00e9 des deux actes d\u2019inconduite \u00e9tablis \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la demanderesse \u00e9tait telle qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas convaincue que la sanction impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la demanderesse devait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e puisque ces actes d\u2019inconduite touchaient directement la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rentes personnes (D\u00e9cision aux para. 202\u2013205).\n[15] \u00c0 mon sens, cette conclusion respecte les contraintes factuelles et juridiques qui encadraient l\u2019action de la Commission dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Dans Lloyd, la Cour n\u2019\u00e9nonce pas que dans les cas o\u00f9 une partie seulement des actes reproch\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 sont \u00e9tablis, la sanction disciplinaire doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre r\u00e9vis\u00e9e \u00e0 la baisse, ce qu\u2019a reconnu la demanderesse \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Je ne crois pas non plus qu\u2019un tel \u00e9nonc\u00e9 puisse en \u00eatre inf\u00e9r\u00e9 (voir aussi : Mackey v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 213, au para. 9). Ce jugement de la Cour nous enseigne plut\u00f4t que dans de telles circonstances, l\u2019explication du tribunal pour le maintien de la sanction doit \u00eatre plus robuste qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019\u00e9tait dans cette affaire. En somme, chaque cas est tributaire de ses circonstances propres.\n[16] Ici, ce que la demanderesse nous demande, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, c\u2019est de reconsid\u00e9rer la question, mettre en doute les conclusions tir\u00e9es par la Commission et, ultimement, substituer nos propres conclusions \u00e0 celles de cette derni\u00e8re. Or, comme la Cour a eu l\u2019occasion de le dire \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, cela va bien au-del\u00e0 du r\u00f4le qui est le n\u00f4tre en mati\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le judiciaire (Vavilov aux paras. 102, 125; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c.

Roy Inc. (Gestion Roy) et 4452712 Canada Inc., se pourvoient \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du jugement du juge Smith de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (la CCI), rendu le 28 novembre 2022 (2022 CCI 144). La CCI a confirm\u00e9 les cotisations \u00e9mises par la ministre du Revenu national \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2014, 2015, 2016 et 2017. La CCI a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que des paiements de primes d\u2019assurance effectu\u00e9s par un tiers (R3D) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de contrats d\u2019assurance, dont les appelantes sont titulaires, constituent un avantage au sens des paragraphes 15(1) et 246(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C. 1985, c. 1 (5e suppl.) (Loi).\n[2] Les appelantes \u00e9taient titulaires de six (6) polices d\u2019assurance-vie enti\u00e8re avec comptes de placement d\u2019une valeur totale de 20 000 000 $. Les polices assuraient la vie de leur actionnaire majoritaire, Marc-Andr\u00e9 Roy, et les primes \u00e9taient pay\u00e9es par R3D, la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire r\u00e9vocable. R3D est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en exploitation d\u00e9tenue majoritairement par M. Roy par l\u2019entremise de Gestion Roy. Cette structure a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue afin que R3D ait le capital n\u00e9cessaire pour racheter ses actions de la succession de M. Roy advenant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier.\n[3] Les appelantes soul\u00e8vent de nombreuses questions devant notre Cour, mais elles se r\u00e9sument en fait \u00e0 la question suivante : la CCI a-t-elle err\u00e9 en d\u00e9terminant que les paiements des primes effectu\u00e9s par R3D, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un contrat d\u2019assurance, constituent un avantage au sens de la Loi?\n[4] La norme de contr\u00f4le qui s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est celle de l\u2019erreur manifeste et dominante (Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235). Comme l\u2019a rappel\u00e9 notre Cour \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, notamment dans la d\u00e9cision Canada c. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 CAF 165 au para 46, ce fardeau est lourd : \u00ab Lorsque l\u2019on invoque une erreur manifeste et dominante, on ne peut se contenter de tirer sur les feuilles et les branches et laisser l\u2019arbre debout. On doit faire tomber l\u2019arbre tout entier \u00bb.\n[5] Nous sommes tous d'avis que cet appel ne peut \u00eatre accueilli. Nous souscrivons essentiellement \u00e0 la d\u00e9marche adopt\u00e9e par la CCI et adoptons son analyse des questions en cause et son raisonnement juridique \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard.\n[6] Les appelantes font valoir qu\u2019en tant que titulaires, elles n\u2019ont jamais obtenu d\u2019avantage puisque les polices d\u2019assurance ont \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9es avant que le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de M. Roy survienne et que de toute mani\u00e8re, elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires au contrat. Or, lorsque les appelantes \u00e9taient titulaires, faut-il rappeler que R3D payait les primes d\u2019assurance ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s ann\u00e9e. Ce faisant, les appelantes ont re\u00e7u un avantage puisque pendant des ann\u00e9es elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 titulaires de polices totalisant un capital-d\u00e9c\u00e8s de 20 000 000$ avec tous les droits y aff\u00e9rant sans avoir \u00e0 s\u2019acquitter des primes. La CCI n\u2019a pas err\u00e9 en concluant qu\u2019il existait d\u2019une part, un avantage pour les appelantes, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le maintien de la couverture d\u2019assurance, et, d\u2019autre part, un appauvrissement correspondant pour R3D, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le montant pay\u00e9 au titre des primes d\u2019assurance.\n[7] Les appelantes soumettent \u00e9galement qu\u2019elles ne se sont pas vues attribuer un avantage puisqu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas per\u00e7u la valeur de rachat des comptes de placement, celle-ci ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e \u00e0 R3D. En tant que titulaires des contrats, le choix de verser la valeur de rachat \u00e0 R3D appartenait aux appelantes. Elles auraient tout autant pu conserver ces montants pour elles-m\u00eames. Nous ne d\u00e9celons aucune erreur dans la conclusion de la CCI selon laquelle \u00ab le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu\u2019a re\u00e7u R3D avec l\u2019aval de M. Roy n\u2019est pas pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019avantage re\u00e7u par les appelantes, soit le montant des primes pay\u00e9es par R3D \u00bb car \u00ab le droit de rachat revient \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9 ou au titulaire de la police et non au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire [R3D] \u00bb (Jugement de la CCI aux para. 72 et 102).\n[8] Les appelantes soutiennent de plus que R3D n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de leur conf\u00e9rer un avantage et qu\u2019en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, lorsque la dur\u00e9e du contrat est prise en compte, l\u2019intention \u00e9tait de conf\u00e9rer un avantage \u00e0 R3D. Cependant, comme notre Cour l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lalibert\u00e9 : \u00ab la jurisprudence n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas de mani\u00e8re universelle un lien entre un tel appauvrissement et l\u2019intention d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et encore moins avec l\u2019intention subjective d\u2019un actionnaire majoritaire \u00bb (Lalibert\u00e9 c. La Reine, 2020 CAF 97 au para. 44 (Lalibert\u00e9)). La CCI a correctement conclu que la question de savoir si une op\u00e9ration commerciale conf\u00e8re un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une question de fait et nous ne d\u00e9celons pas d\u2019erreur qui justifierait notre intervention.\n[9] Compte tenu de notre conclusion quant \u00e0 la qualification de l\u2019avantage, nous ne voyons aucune erreur dans la d\u00e9termination de la valeur de l\u2019avantage qu\u2019a faite la CCI pour les ann\u00e9es en cause.\n[10] Finalement, nous partageons la conclusion de la CCI selon laquelle l\u2019analyse \u00e0 \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e au terme du paragraphe 246(1) est substantiellement la m\u00eame que celle prescrite par le paragraphe 15(1) (voir Lalibert\u00e9).\n[11] L\u2019appel sera donc rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\n\u00ab Richard Boivin \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIERS :\nA-273-22 ET A-274-22\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nGESTION M.-A.

Contexte\n[3] EllisDon Corporation a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal canadien du commerce ext\u00e9rieur au sujet d\u2019une demande d\u2019appel d\u2019offres du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics et des Services gouvernementaux (Travaux publics) pour la r\u00e9habilitation et l\u2019optimisation d\u2019un b\u00e2timent.\n[4] EllisDon a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que Travaux publics n\u2019avait pas \u00e9valu\u00e9 les offres conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019appel d\u2019offres et qu\u2019il avait ainsi viol\u00e9 les accords commerciaux. EllisDon a demand\u00e9, entre autres, une indemnit\u00e9 en reconnaissance de l\u2019occasion manqu\u00e9e \u00e0 compter de la date o\u00f9 le contrat lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de l\u2019attribution du contrat \u00e0 un autre soumissionnaire.\n[5] Le Tribunal a rendu sa d\u00e9cision le 25 septembre 2023 et ses motifs le 10 octobre 2023 (la d\u00e9cision). Le Tribunal a conclu que la plainte d\u2019EllisDon \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement recommand\u00e9 que Travaux publics verse \u00e0 EllisDon \u00ab une indemnit\u00e9 en reconnaissance de l\u2019occasion manqu\u00e9e, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant \u00bb. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal a recommand\u00e9 \u00ab que les parties n\u00e9gocient le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant \u00bb, et qu\u2019elles rendent compte au Tribunal de l\u2019issue de leurs n\u00e9gociations dans les 60 jours suivant la date de publication des motifs du Tribunal. Enfin, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit que, si les parties ne parvenaient pas \u00e0 s\u2019entendre \u00ab sur le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 \u00bb, le Tribunal \u00e9tablirait le montant d\u00e9finitif de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir donn\u00e9 aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser des observations compl\u00e8tes sur cette question.\n[6] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. La demande indique que la d\u00e9cision est d\u00e9raisonnable et que le Tribunal a outrepass\u00e9 le pouvoir que lui conf\u00e8re la loi lorsqu\u2019il a recommand\u00e9 une indemnisation pour EllisDon.\n[7] Quelques jours apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a demand\u00e9 une ordonnance de suspension de sa demande [traduction] \u00ab jusqu\u2019\u00e0 30 jours apr\u00e8s l\u2019issue de la phase d\u2019indemnisation devant le Tribunal \u00bb.\n[8] \u00c0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate pour suspension de proc\u00e9dures du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, EllisDon a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de suspendre la phase d\u2019indemnisation jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la Cour statue sur la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou sur sa requ\u00eate pour suspension de sa demande. Malgr\u00e9 la demande du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de poursuivre la phase d\u2019indemnisation, le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de suspendre la phase d\u2019indemnisation de la plainte d\u2019EllisDon jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la Cour ait statu\u00e9 sur la requ\u00eate pour suspension d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\nII. Analyse\n[9] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(1)b) de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. 1985, ch. F-7, conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la Cour un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de suspendre une affaire dont elle est saisie lorsque \u00ab l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice l\u2019exige \u00bb. L\u2019exercice de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire est guid\u00e9 par certains principes, dont celui \u00ab d\u2019apporter une solution au litige qui soit juste et la plus exp\u00e9ditive et \u00e9conomique possible \u00bb : article 3 des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, D.O.R.S.\/98-106 (les R\u00e8gles); Coote c. Lawyers\u2019 Professional Indemnity Company, 2013 CAF 143, au para. 12. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il faudra beaucoup pour convaincre la Cour d\u2019accorder une suspension lorsqu\u2019une longue suspension est demand\u00e9e ou lorsque le retard qui s\u2019ensuit aura des effets s\u00e9v\u00e8res sur une partie : Mylan Pharmaceuticals ULC c. AstraZeneca Canada, Inc., 2011 CAF 312, au para. 5.\n[10] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dit que trois \u00ab circonstances cl\u00e9s \u00bb militent en faveur de la suspension de sa demande.\nA. N\u00e9gociations non conclues\n[11] Premi\u00e8rement, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral fait valoir que la Cour devrait suspendre sa demande afin que les parties puissent poursuivre les n\u00e9gociations sur le montant de l\u2019indemnisation. Si les parties parviennent \u00e0 une entente, la question enti\u00e8re peut \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9e et, dans le cas contraire, le Tribunal se prononcera sur le montant de l\u2019indemnisation.\n[12] Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord sur le fait que cet argument milite en faveur de la suspension de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Comme EllisDon le fait remarquer \u00e0 juste titre, les parties n\u2019ont pas besoin d\u2019une suspension pour n\u00e9gocier un r\u00e8glement de leur diff\u00e9rend.\n[13] J\u2019ajouterai que rien ne garantit que les parties s\u2019entendront sur le montant de l\u2019indemnisation. \u00c0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019une telle entente, le Tribunal devra passer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape du processus de traitement de la plainte portant sur l\u2019indemnisation. EllisDon soutient que cette \u00e9tape pourrait \u00eatre longue et co\u00fbteuse. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de son argument, EllisDon fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures du Tribunal, qui montrent que plus d\u2019un an peut s\u2019\u00e9couler entre le moment o\u00f9 le Tribunal rend une d\u00e9cision sur la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une plainte et celui o\u00f9 il rend une d\u00e9cision sur l\u2019indemnisation. Par exemple, dans la d\u00e9cision The Masha Krupp Translation Group Ltd. c. Agence du revenu du Canada, les motifs sur la validit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9s le 20 mars 2017 (voir CanLII 149224 (CA TCCE) 2017), et les motifs sur l\u2019indemnisation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9s le 17 octobre 2018 (voir CanLII 146634 (CA TCCE) 2018); dans la d\u00e9cision Oshkosh Defence Canada c. Minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics et des Services gouvernementaux, les motifs sur la validit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9s le 20 juillet 2016 (voir CanLII 153258 (CA TCCE) 2016), et ceux concernant l\u2019indemnisation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9s le 29 d\u00e9cembre 2017 (voir CanLII 146784 (CA TCCE) 2018).\n[14] Cette mise en \u00e9vidence du temps qui peut s\u2019\u00e9couler entre une d\u00e9cision sur la validit\u00e9 et une d\u00e9cision sur l\u2019indemnisation ne constitue absolument pas une critique du travail du Tribunal. Il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t d\u2019une reconnaissance du fait que l\u2019\u00e9tape du travail du Tribunal portant sur l\u2019indemnisation est complexe et qu\u2019elle comprend des travaux importants en mati\u00e8re de finances, de comptabilit\u00e9 et de preuve que les parties doivent d\u00e9poser aux fins d\u2019examen par le Tribunal. Le fait est que d\u2019indiquer aux parties qu\u2019elles doivent proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination du montant de la phase d\u2019indemnisation de la plainte sans justification suppl\u00e9mentaire ne serait pas conforme au principe directeur qui est d\u2019apporter une solution au litige qui soit juste et la plus exp\u00e9ditive et \u00e9conomique possible pour chaque instance entendue sur le fond.\nB. La port\u00e9e de l\u2019indemnisation n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie\n[15] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral fait valoir que la port\u00e9e de l\u2019indemnisation demeure floue et que le Tribunal devrait trancher cette question avant que la Cour soit tenue d\u2019intervenir.\n[16] Encore une fois, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019indemnisation : Travaux publics est tenu de verser \u00ab \u00e0 EllisDon [\u2026] une indemnit\u00e9 en reconnaissance de l\u2019occasion manqu\u00e9e \u00bb : la d\u00e9cision, aux para. 72, 83 et 90.\n[17] En outre, le seul motif de contr\u00f4le soulev\u00e9 dans la demande de r\u00e9vision judiciaire du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est que le Tribunal aurait [traduction] \u00ab outrepass\u00e9 le pouvoir que lui conf\u00e8re la loi lorsqu\u2019il a recommand\u00e9 le versement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 EllisDon en reconnaissance de l\u2019occasion manqu\u00e9e \u00bb. Au cours de la phase de validit\u00e9 de la plainte d\u2019EllisDon, Travaux publics a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le m\u00eame argument et le Tribunal l\u2019a rejet\u00e9 : aux para. 67 \u00e0 72 de la d\u00e9cision. Il s\u2019ensuit que le Tribunal ne r\u00e9examinera pas la question de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019indemnisation ni celle de savoir s\u2019il avait le pouvoir de la recommander. En effet, la d\u00e9cision indique clairement que l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante du processus de traitement de la plainte sera consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du \u00ab montant \u00bb de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9, soit par voie de n\u00e9gociation entre les parties, soit, si n\u00e9cessaire, par le Tribunal : paragraphe 90 de la d\u00e9cision.\n[18] Dans ce contexte, il serait illogique pour la Cour d\u2019acquiescer \u00e0 la demande du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de surseoir \u00e0 l\u2019instance pour laisser le Tribunal d\u00e9cider d\u2019une question qu\u2019il ne tranchera pas.\nC. \u00c9conomie des ressources judiciaires\n[19] Le dernier argument du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est que la division de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal \u2013 l\u2019\u00e9tape portant sur la validit\u00e9 de la plainte et l\u2019\u00e9tape portant sur le montant de l\u2019indemnisation \u2013 exige la suspension de sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Sinon, il y a un risque de duplication on\u00e9reuse des ressources judiciaires et de conclusions incoh\u00e9rentes d\u00e9coulant de ce qui suit :\n\u2022la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019un r\u00e8glement n\u00e9goci\u00e9 sur le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 ou la d\u00e9termination par le Tribunal de ce montant rende inutile la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire;\n\u2022la possibilit\u00e9 de deux demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire : celle qui est actuellement devant la Cour et une autre concernant le montant de l\u2019indemnisation.\n[20] Je suis d\u2019accord pour dire qu\u2019il faut \u00e9viter les proc\u00e9dures judiciaires inutiles, la duplication des ressources judiciaires et les conclusions incoh\u00e9rentes, mais je ne pense pas qu\u2019il y ait un risque de ce genre de situation si je n\u2019accorde pas une suspension de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Je m\u2019explique.\n[21] Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la Cour, \u00ab [l]a division, sans plus, n\u2019entra\u00eene pas automatiquement l\u2019octroi d\u2019un sursis \u00bb : Laperri\u00e8re c. D. & A. MacLeod Company Ltd., 2010 CAF 84, au para. 21. Cela est particuli\u00e8rement vrai lorsque les deux phases d\u2019une instance ne sont pas \u00ab inextricablement li\u00e9es \u00bb : Clayton c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CAF 1, au para. 19. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 soit connu pour que la Cour se prononce sur la question de savoir si le Tribunal avait le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la loi de recommander le versement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 en reconnaissance de l\u2019occasion manqu\u00e9e. En outre, la d\u00e9termination du montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 ne r\u00e9glera pas la question du pouvoir que la loi conf\u00e8re au Tribunal de sorte que, si Travaux publics n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord avec le montant fix\u00e9 par le Tribunal, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral continuera de donner suite \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente demande de r\u00e9vision judiciaire. En revanche, comme EllisDon le fait remarquer, une d\u00e9cision de la Cour selon laquelle le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la loi mettra fin \u00e0 la question du montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9. Il est donc dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des parties de d\u00e9terminer, dans les plus brefs d\u00e9lais, si le Tribunal avait le pouvoir de recommander le versement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 en reconnaissance de l\u2019occasion manqu\u00e9e.\n[22] Non seulement cette connaissance d\u00e9terminera-t-elle la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de la plainte devant le Tribunal, mais elle pourrait aussi permettre aux parties de r\u00e9aliser des \u00e9conomies consid\u00e9rables si cette deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape s\u2019av\u00e8re inutile. Aux paragraphes 13 et 14 ci-dessus, j\u2019ai soulign\u00e9 \u00e0 quel point la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 rendre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape portant sur l\u2019indemnisation pouvait \u00eatre complexe et exigeante. Un processus aussi complexe et exigeant est susceptible d\u2019entra\u00eener des co\u00fbts importants pour les parties. Ces co\u00fbts ne devraient pas \u00eatre engag\u00e9s, sauf s\u2019il le faut, mais on ne pourra se prononcer sur ce point si la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est suspendue.\n[23] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que l\u2019\u00e9conomie judiciaire et les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice n\u2019\u00e9tayent pas la requ\u00eate du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral visant la suspension de sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\nIII. Conclusion\n[24] Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate pour suspension d\u2019instance sera rejet\u00e9e et les d\u00e9pens seront adjug\u00e9s en faveur de la d\u00e9fenderesse.\n\u00ab Nathalie Goyette \u00bb\nj.c.a\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\nA-289-23\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nLE PROCUREUR G\u00c9N\u00c9RAL DU CANADA c.

Contexte\n[1] Notre Cour est saisie d\u2019un appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (2022 CF 1218, motifs du juge Michael D. Manson) dans une action intent\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 6(1) du R\u00e8glement sur les m\u00e9dicaments brevet\u00e9s (avis de conformit\u00e9), DORS\/93-133. Dans cette action, les intim\u00e9es, Janssen Inc. et Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. (collectivement, Janssen), ont demand\u00e9 une d\u00e9claration selon laquelle l\u2019appelante, Pharmascience Inc. (Pharmascience), porterait atteinte au brevet canadien no 2 655 335 (le brevet 335) si elle fabriquait, utilisait ou vendait sa version g\u00e9n\u00e9rique du m\u00e9dicament brevet\u00e9 de Janssen appel\u00e9 INVEGA SUSTENNA.\n[2] L\u2019INVEGA SUSTENNA est un ester de palmitate de palip\u00e9ridone pour le traitement de la schizophr\u00e9nie et de troubles connexes. Le brevet 335 d\u00e9crit un sch\u00e9ma visant \u00e0 produire un profil de concentration plasmatique optimal. Il indique l\u2019administration d\u2019une premi\u00e8re dose d\u2019attaque dans le muscle delto\u00efde le jour 1, l\u2019administration d\u2019une deuxi\u00e8me dose d\u2019attaque dans le muscle delto\u00efde le jour 8 puis l\u2019administration de doses d\u2019entretien mensuelles dans le muscle delto\u00efde ou le muscle fessier. Pour les patients ayant une fonction r\u00e9nale normale, la premi\u00e8re et la deuxi\u00e8me doses d\u2019attaque sont de 150 milligrammes \u00e9quivalents (mg \u00e9q.) et de 100 mg \u00e9q., respectivement, et les doses d\u2019entretien mensuelles sont de 75 mg \u00e9q. chacune. Pour les patients ayant une fonction r\u00e9nale d\u00e9faillante, la premi\u00e8re et la deuxi\u00e8me doses d\u2019attaque sont de 100 mg \u00e9q. et de 75 mg \u00e9q. respectivement, et les doses d\u2019entretien mensuelles sont de 50 mg \u00e9q. chacune.\n[3] Pharmascience s\u2019est d\u00e9fendue contre l\u2019action de Janssen en invoquant plusieurs motifs. Le seul motif qui demeure utile dans le pr\u00e9sent appel est l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle les revendications du brevet 335 sont invalides parce qu\u2019elles visent un objet non brevetable, \u00e0 savoir des m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 cette all\u00e9gation et a conclu que les revendications du brevet 335 sont valides.\n[4] Pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner un peu l\u2019histoire et la nature de l\u2019interdiction de breveter des m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical. Pour les motifs qui suivent, je rejetterais le pr\u00e9sent appel.\nII. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\n[5] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 la question des m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical aux paragraphes 160 \u00e0 172 de ses motifs.\n[6] Apr\u00e8s avoir not\u00e9 que l\u2019interdiction de breveter des m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical tire son origine de l\u2019arr\u00eat Tennessee Eastman Co. et al. C. Commissaire des Brevets, [1974] R.C.S. 111 (Tennessee Eastman), de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, puis fait observer que la jurisprudence dans ce domaine n\u2019est pas constante, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a affirm\u00e9 que le point de d\u00e9part consiste \u00e0 se demander : \u00ab que disent les revendications? \u00bb (voir les motifs de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, par. 161, renvoyant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Bayer Inc. c. Cobalt Pharmaceuticals Company, 2013 CF 1061, [2013] A.C.F. no 1152 (QL), par. 162 (Bayer)).\n[7] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ensuite examin\u00e9 l\u2019argument de Pharmascience selon lequel le fait que la dose d\u2019entretien pr\u00e9vue s\u2019inscrive dans une gamme (de 25 mg \u00e9q. \u00e0 150 mg \u00e9q., selon la monographie de produit de l\u2019INVEGA SUSTENNA) indique qu\u2019aucune dose pr\u00e9cise n\u2019aura le m\u00eame effet sur tous les patients et que le choix de la dose appropri\u00e9e pour un patient donn\u00e9 exigera que le m\u00e9decin prescripteur exerce sa comp\u00e9tence et son jugement.\n[8] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a not\u00e9 qu\u2019il est bien \u00e9tabli que les revendications visant un produit vendable ne sont pas interdites au motif qu\u2019elles constitueraient des m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical. Elle a ensuite conclu que l\u2019analyse relative aux m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical ne concerne que les revendications d\u2019utilisation qui, comme elle l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9, \u00e9taient les revendications 17 \u00e0 32 du brevet 335 (utilisation d\u2019une forme m\u00e9dicamenteuse) et non les revendications du produit qui, comme elle l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9, \u00e9taient les revendications 1 \u00e0 16 (seringues pr\u00e9remplies), les revendications 33 \u00e0 48 (pr\u00e9paration d\u2019un m\u00e9dicament) et les revendications 49 \u00e0 63 (forme posologique).\n[9] Au paragraphe 164 de ses motifs, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a not\u00e9 qu\u2019il fallait mettre l\u2019accent sur la question de savoir s\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire que le professionnel exerce sa comp\u00e9tence et son jugement pour mettre en \u0153uvre l\u2019invention revendiqu\u00e9e et elle a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la jurisprudence selon laquelle :\nles revendications qui se limitent \u00e0 des posologies et \u00e0 des calendriers d\u2019administration sont brevetables si les doses et les intervalles d\u2019administration sont fixes [\u2026] tandis [\u2026] que les revendications relatives \u00e0 des fourchettes posologiques ou des intervalles d\u2019administration qui exigent du m\u00e9decin qu\u2019il fasse appel \u00e0 ses comp\u00e9tences et \u00e0 son jugement visent un produit non commercial et sont donc non brevetables [\u2026] [Renvois omis.]\n[10] Toutefois, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement not\u00e9 que la dichotomie qu\u2019elle a pos\u00e9e (entre les posologies et fr\u00e9quences fixes et les posologies et fr\u00e9quences variables) a un fondement discutable. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle cite le passage suivant de l\u2019arr\u00eat de notre Cour Corporation de soins de sant\u00e9 Hospira c. Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research, 2020 CAF 30, par. 52 (Hospira) :\nCet \u00e9tat de la jurisprudence pr\u00e9sente une simplicit\u00e9 attirante. Toutefois, il ne me para\u00eet pas \u00e9vident que les d\u00e9cisions de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada qui constituent le fondement du principe voulant que les m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical ne soient pas brevetables justifient de faire une distinction entre une posologie (ou une fr\u00e9quence) fixe et une gamme de posologies (ou de fr\u00e9quences). Il semblerait qu\u2019un professionnel de la sant\u00e9 serait limit\u00e9 dans l\u2019exercice de sa comp\u00e9tence dans l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des cas. Aussi, on pourrait soutenir qu\u2019un m\u00e9dicament n\u2019est pas moins vendable simplement parce que sa posologie ou sa fr\u00e9quence d\u2019administration n\u2019est pas fixe.\n[11] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que les revendications 17 \u00e0 32 du brevet 335 n\u2019exigent pas que le professionnel exerce sa comp\u00e9tence ou son jugement parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun choix \u00e0 faire concernant la posologie, qui est enti\u00e8rement fixe. Elle a conclu que les choix relatifs aux fen\u00eatres posologiques et aux sites d\u2019injection n\u2019avaient aucune incidence clinique et n\u2019entravaient donc pas l\u2019exercice par le m\u00e9decin de sa comp\u00e9tence et de son jugement. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a not\u00e9 que le m\u00e9decin peut choisir de prescrire le sch\u00e9ma posologique revendiqu\u00e9, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e0 exercer sa comp\u00e9tence ou son jugement pour le mettre en \u0153uvre.\n[12] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le brevet 335 vise un objet brevetable.\nIII. Les questions en litige\n[13] Pharmascience fait valoir que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis des erreurs de droit \u00e0 deux \u00e9gards :\nen excluant les revendications 1 \u00e0 16 et 33 \u00e0 63 du brevet 335 de l\u2019analyse relative aux m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical au motif qu\u2019elles visaient un produit vendable;\nen concluant que les revendications en cause sont brevetables en raison de la dichotomie entre les sch\u00e9mas posologiques fixes et variables.\n[14] J\u2019examine chacun de ces arguments \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le, mais je commence par passer en revue la jurisprudence cl\u00e9 sur l\u2019exclusion des m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical.\nIV. La norme de contr\u00f4le\n[15] Les parties conviennent que la norme de contr\u00f4le qui s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est celle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33, [2002] 2 R.C.S. 235. Les questions de droit sont examin\u00e9es selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte et les questions de fait et les questions mixtes de fait et de droit, lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune question de droit isolable, sont examin\u00e9es selon la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et dominante. L\u2019erreur manifeste est l\u2019erreur qui est \u00e9vidente. L\u2019erreur dominante est l\u2019erreur qui touche directement \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire. Lorsque l\u2019on invoque une erreur manifeste et dominante, on ne peut se contenter de tirer sur les feuilles et les branches et de laisser l\u2019arbre debout. On doit faire tomber l\u2019arbre tout entier (Canada c. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 CAF 165, [2012] A.C.F. no 669, par. 46, cit\u00e9 avec approbation dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Benhaim c. St-Germain, 2016 CSC 48, [2016] 2 R.C.S. 352, par. 38).\n[16] Pharmascience soutient que toutes les questions en litige sont des questions de droit susceptibles de contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte. Pharmascience ne soutient pas que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis des erreurs susceptibles de contr\u00f4le selon la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et dominante. Je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019approche de Pharmascience.\nV. Analyse\nA. Jurisprudence concernant l\u2019interdiction de breveter les m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical\n[17] La Loi sur les brevets, L.R.C. (1985), ch. P-4, ne contient aucune interdiction explicite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des revendications visant des m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical. De plus, le paragraphe 43(2) de la Loi sur les brevets pr\u00e9voit que les brevets sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s valides. Les revendications sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es ne pas viser des m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical et il incombe \u00e0 la partie qui les met en doute (Pharmascience, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce) d\u2019\u00e9tablir le contraire.\n[18] Comme il est indiqu\u00e9 plus haut, l\u2019origine de cette interdiction au Canada est l\u2019arr\u00eat Tennessee Eastman rendu par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada en 1974. Cet arr\u00eat concernait une tentative de breveter une m\u00e9thode chirurgicale de r\u00e9union ou de conglutination des bords d\u2019incisions ou de blessures de tissus organiques vivants par l\u2019application \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat liquide des compos\u00e9s adh\u00e9sifs d\u00e9crits dans les revendications, directement sur l\u2019un au moins des bords du tissu que l\u2019on veut r\u00e9unir. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, le paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi sur les brevets interdisait, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les revendications de \u00ab substances pr\u00e9par\u00e9es ou produites par des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s chimiques et destin\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019alimentation ou \u00e0 la m\u00e9dication \u00bb. Par cons\u00e9quent, les compos\u00e9s adh\u00e9sifs vis\u00e9s dans la demande de brevet en question ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre revendiqu\u00e9s en tant que tels.\n[19] La Cour supr\u00eame a confirm\u00e9 le rejet de la demande de brevet par le commissaire aux brevets. Son analyse portait sur la d\u00e9finition d\u2019\u00ab invention \u00bb \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la Loi sur les brevets. \u00c0 la page 118, la Cour a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\nIl est clair qu\u2019une nouvelle substance utile dans le traitement m\u00e9dical ou chirurgical des hommes et des animaux est une \u00ab invention \u00bb. Il est \u00e9galement \u00e9vident qu\u2019un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de fabrication d\u2019une telle substance est aussi une \u00ab invention \u00bb. En fait, la substance peut \u00eatre revendiqu\u00e9e comme une invention seulement lorsqu\u2019elle est \u00ab pr\u00e9par\u00e9e ou produite par \u00bb un tel proc\u00e9d\u00e9. Mais que dire de la m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical ou chirurgical qui utilise la substance nouvelle? Peut-elle aussi \u00eatre revendiqu\u00e9e comme une invention? Pour en \u00e9tablir l\u2019utilit\u00e9, il faut la d\u00e9finir dans une certaine mesure. Dans le cas d\u2019un m\u00e9dicament, les effets souhait\u00e9s aussi bien que les effets secondaires \u00e0 redouter doivent \u00eatre \u00e9tablis, de m\u00eame que la posologie convenable, les modes d\u2019administration et les contre-indications. Peut-on revendiquer ces donn\u00e9es th\u00e9rapeutiques par elles\u2011m\u00eames comme une invention distincte consistant en une m\u00e9thode de traitement qui comporte l\u2019utilisation du nouveau m\u00e9dicament? Je ne le crois pas, et il me semble que l\u2019art. 41 indique sans \u00e9quivoque que tel n\u2019est pas le cas.\n[20] \u00c0 la page 119, la Cour a ajout\u00e9 que, \u00ab [\u00e9]tant arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que les m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical ne sont pas vis\u00e9es comme \u201cproc\u00e9d\u00e9s\u201d par d\u00e9finition d\u2019\u201cinvention\u201d, le m\u00eame raisonnement doit, pour les m\u00eames motifs, s\u2019appliquer aux m\u00e9thodes de traitement chirurgical \u00bb.\n[21] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a eu l\u2019occasion de commenter l\u2019arr\u00eat Tennessee Eastman dans son arr\u00eat subs\u00e9quent Shell Oil Co. c. Commissaire des brevets, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 536, p. 554 (Shell) :\nDans l\u2019arr\u00eat Tennessee Eastman Co. c. Commissaire des brevets (1970), 62 C.P.R. 117 (C. de l\u2019\u00c9.), confirm\u00e9 par [1974] R.C.S. 111, la requ\u00e9rante demandait un brevet \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une m\u00e9thode de suture apr\u00e8s une intervention chirurgicale qui consiste \u00e0 utiliser une substance adh\u00e9sive \u00e0 laquelle on avait d\u00e9couvert la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019adh\u00e9rer fermement au tissu vivant. Le commissaire a refus\u00e9 le brevet parce qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas de la sorte de d\u00e9couverte (l\u2019adh\u00e9sif lui-m\u00eame n\u2019\u00e9tant pas nouveau) qui r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019\u00ab invention \u00bb au sens de la Loi. Il a conclu notamment qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une \u00ab r\u00e9alisation \u00bb parce qu\u2019elle ne servait qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019occasion de traitements m\u00e9dicaux ou chirurgicaux et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas d\u2019incidence sur le commerce ou l\u2019industrie. La requ\u00e9rante a interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier o\u00f9 la seule question \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer \u00e9tait celle de savoir si cette utilisation de l\u2019adh\u00e9sif \u00e9tait vis\u00e9e par l\u2019expression \u00ab r\u00e9alisation ou proc\u00e9d\u00e9 pr\u00e9sentant le caract\u00e8re de la nouveaut\u00e9 et de l\u2019utilit\u00e9 \u00bb au sens de la Loi sur les brevets. On a conclu qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019\u00e9tait pas pour les motifs donn\u00e9s par le commissaire. En effet la substance n\u2019\u00e9tait pas brevetable parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait essentiellement de nature non \u00e9conomique et non reli\u00e9e au commerce ou \u00e0 l\u2019industrie. Elle appartenait plut\u00f4t au domaine de la comp\u00e9tence professionnelle.\n[22] L\u2019interdiction explicite des revendications de \u00ab substances pr\u00e9par\u00e9es ou produites par des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s chimiques et destin\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019alimentation ou \u00e0 la m\u00e9dication \u00bb, pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi sur les brevets, a plus tard \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9e par l\u2019abrogation de cette disposition. Toutefois, cette modification n\u2019a pas eu pour effet de lever l\u2019interdiction de breveter des m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical. En effet, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a confirm\u00e9 fait dans les observations sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Tennessee Eastman qu\u2019elle a formul\u00e9es dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Apotex Inc. c. Wellcome Foundation Ltd., 2002 CSC 77, [2002] 4 R.C.S. 153, par. 49 (Wellcome), o\u00f9 elle a cit\u00e9 l\u2019explication pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Shell Oil selon laquelle une revendication d\u2019une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical n\u2019est pas brevetable parce qu\u2019elle est \u00ab essentiellement de nature non \u00e9conomique et non reli\u00e9e au commerce ou \u00e0 l\u2019industrie \u00bb et \u00ab appart[ient] plut\u00f4t au domaine de la comp\u00e9tence professionnelle \u00bb.\n[23] L\u2019arr\u00eat Wellcome concernait un brevet revendiquant l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019AZT dans le traitement du VIH. La Cour a conclu que le brevet ne portait pas sur une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical, affirmant ce qui suit au paragraphe 50 :\nLe brevet pour l\u2019AZT ne cherche pas \u00e0 \u00ab circonscrire \u00bb un secteur de traitement m\u00e9dical. Il vise \u00e0 obtenir le droit exclusif de commercialiser l\u2019AZT. La question de savoir comment et quand, s\u2019il y a lieu, employer l\u2019AZT est laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence et au jugement des membres de la profession m\u00e9dicale.\n[24] Les arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada Tennessee Eastman, Shell Oil et Wellcome sont des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents que, de toute \u00e9vidence, notre Cour est tenue de suivre. Il est important de se rappeler ce qu\u2019ils indiquent et ce qu\u2019ils n\u2019indiquent pas. Ce qu\u2019ils indiquent, c\u2019est que les m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical ne sont pas brevetables parce qu\u2019elles ne constituent pas une \u00ab invention \u00bb au sens de la Loi sur les brevets. Cela s\u2019explique par le fait que les m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical ne sont pas li\u00e9es au commerce ni \u00e0 l\u2019industrie et qu\u2019elles concernent des comp\u00e9tences professionnelles de nature non \u00e9conomique. Les brevets ne doivent pas viser \u00e0 circonscrire l\u2019exercice de ces comp\u00e9tences (y compris la fa\u00e7on dont un m\u00e9dicament doit \u00eatre administr\u00e9 et le moment o\u00f9 il doit l\u2019\u00eatre), mais il peut couvrir la commercialisation.\n[25] La jurisprudence qui s\u2019est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e au-del\u00e0 de ce qui est discut\u00e9 dans ces arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire ce qu\u2019ils n\u2019indiquent pas) ne lie pas notre Cour de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, bien que cette derni\u00e8re doive suivre ses propres arr\u00eats, \u00e0 moins que ceux-ci ne soient manifestement erron\u00e9s (Miller c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2002 CAF 370, par. 10). Je me penche maintenant sur cette jurisprudence pour examiner les principes qui en d\u00e9coulent.\n[26] Les renvois \u00ab au commerce ou \u00e0 l\u2019industrie \u00bb et \u00e0 la \u00ab commercialisation \u00bb par la Cour supr\u00eame semblent expliquer pourquoi de nombreux arr\u00eats et d\u00e9cisions portent sur la question de savoir si une invention concerne un \u00ab produit vendable \u00bb : voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Hospira, par. 53, ainsi que l\u2019arr\u00eat Wellcome rendu par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ([2000] A.C.F. no 1770, par. 74). Cette question centrale est \u00e9galement examin\u00e9e dans les d\u00e9cisions suivantes de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale : Merck Frosst Canada & Co. c. Apotex Inc., 2005 CF 755, par. 136 et 137; Merck & Co., Inc. c. Pharmascience Inc., 2010 CF 510, par. 110 et 114 (Merck 2010); Janssen Inc. c. Mylan Pharmaceuticals ULC, 2010 CF 1123, par. 53 (Mylan); Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. c. Cobalt Pharmaceuticals Company, 2013 CF 985, par. 78, 91 et 98 (Novartis), conf. par 2014 CAF 17; Bayer, par. 162; AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2014 CF 1251, par. 115 et 125 (AbbVie); et Biogen Canada Inc. c. Taro Pharmaceuticals Inc., 2020 CF 621, [2020] A.C.F. no 611, par. 211. L\u2019id\u00e9e, \u00e0 laquelle je souscris, est qu\u2019un produit vendable a une valeur \u00e9conomique et se distingue du travail sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 d\u2019un m\u00e9decin et, par cons\u00e9quent, ne constitue pas une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical tel que l\u2019entend la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada.\n[27] En ce qui concerne les inventions li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019administration d\u2019un m\u00e9dicament, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9tabli, dans sa jurisprudence, une approche selon laquelle les revendications peuvent \u00eatre jug\u00e9es comme visant un objet brevetable ou une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical non brevetable suivant que celles-ci pr\u00e9voient une posologie (ou un intervalle d\u2019administration) fixe ou une gamme de posologies (ou d\u2019intervalles). Cette approche semble tirer son origine de la d\u00e9cision Axcan Pharma Inc. c. Pharmascience Inc., 2006 CF 527, aux paragraphes 45 \u00e0 51 (Axcan), puis avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e dans les d\u00e9cisions Merck 2010 aux paragraphes 111 \u00e0 114 et Novartis aux paragraphes 82 \u00e0 99.\n[28] Comme le montre le passage de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hospira cit\u00e9 au paragraphe 10 ci\u2011dessus, la distinction entre les posologies (ou les fr\u00e9quences) fixes et variables a un fondement discutable, puisque cette distinction semble n\u2019avoir aucune incidence sur le fait que le m\u00e9dicament en question est ou non un produit vendable. Toutefois, la distinction est plus logique si l\u2019on tient compte des lignes directrices fournies dans la d\u00e9cision Bayer et mentionn\u00e9es au paragraphe 6 ci-dessus, selon lesquelles ce qui importe, c\u2019est ce que disent les revendications; le produit que le titulaire du brevet met en march\u00e9 est accessoire. \u00c0 mon avis, il est permis de mettre l\u2019accent sur la question de savoir si le sch\u00e9ma posologique est fixe ou variable, \u00e0 condition que l\u2019analyse demeure li\u00e9e \u00e0 la question essentielle de savoir si l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019invention demande qu\u2019un professionnel exerce sa comp\u00e9tence. C\u2019est ce qui ressort de la d\u00e9cision Mylan, o\u00f9 est pris note de l\u2019attention port\u00e9e, dans les d\u00e9cisions Axcan et Merck 2010, aux gammes de posologies et o\u00f9 \u00e9tait affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit, au paragraphe 26 :\nJe retiens de la jurisprudence pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e qu\u2019une revendication de brevet visant une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical qui, de par sa nature, appartient \u00e0 un domaine pour lequel on peut penser que la comp\u00e9tence ou le jugement du m\u00e9decin est n\u00e9cessaire n\u2019est pas brevetable au Canada. Cela comprend l\u2019administration d\u2019un m\u00e9dicament lorsque le m\u00e9decin, bien qu\u2019il se fie \u00e0 la recommandation de dosage du brevet\u00e9, doit tout de m\u00eame pr\u00eater attention au profil du patient et \u00e0 la r\u00e9action de ce dernier au compos\u00e9.\n[29] Dans la d\u00e9cision Mylan, au paragraphe 4, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a not\u00e9 que, \u00ab l\u2019id\u00e9e originale du brevet [en cause] se limite \u00e0 la d\u00e9couverte dont se r\u00e9clame Janssen, soit qu\u2019un lent ajustement de la posologie de la galantamine a am\u00e9lior\u00e9 la tol\u00e9rance des patients au m\u00e9dicament en r\u00e9duisant les effets secondaires et a permis l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une dose d\u2019entretien plus faible que celle qui s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e efficace \u00bb. La Cour a conclu que les revendications en question concernaient une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical non brevetable parce qu\u2019elles d\u00e9crivaient un \u00ab ajustement posologique \u00bb (voir par. 50) qui exigeait du m\u00e9decin qu\u2019il exerce constamment sa comp\u00e9tence et son jugement professionnels. Le monopole revendiqu\u00e9 par les revendications aurait donc entrav\u00e9 la capacit\u00e9 du m\u00e9decin \u00e0 exercer cette comp\u00e9tence et ce jugement.\n[30] Malgr\u00e9 cela, \u00e0 mon avis, ce serait passer les bornes que d\u2019affirmer que tout sch\u00e9ma posologique exigeant que le m\u00e9decin surveille le patient est non brevetable. Une telle interdiction serait trop vaste et toucherait potentiellement presque tous les m\u00e9dicaments.\n[31] Dans la d\u00e9cision AbbVie, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail la jurisprudence sur les m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical. Aux paragraphes 110 et 121, la Cour a fait la distinction, \u00e0 juste titre \u00e0 mon avis, entre l\u2019exercice de la comp\u00e9tence et du jugement pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019utiliser une invention revendiqu\u00e9e (ce qui n\u2019est pas indicatif d\u2019une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical) et l\u2019exercice de la comp\u00e9tence et du jugement pour d\u00e9cider comment utiliser l\u2019invention (ce qui est indicatif d\u2019une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical vis\u00e9e par l\u2019interdiction).\n[32] Comme dans la d\u00e9cision Mylan, la d\u00e9cision AbbVie met en garde contre la simple distinction entre les posologies et intervalles fixes et les posologies et fr\u00e9quences variables. Les paragraphes 112 \u00e0 114 sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9s ainsi :\n[112] L\u2019intim\u00e9 nous met en garde contre le recours \u00e0 des formules toutes faites plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 des principes. \u00c0 mon avis, la jurisprudence traduit bien cette approche et le principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9, peu importe le fait que les tribunaux aient employ\u00e9 des expressions telles que \u00ab circonscrire \u00bb ou \u00ab doses pr\u00e9cises \u00bb. Dans chaque cas, il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si le brevet revendique une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical. En appliquant les m\u00eames principes, des revendications portant sur des doses et des intervalles posologiques pr\u00e9cis qui n\u2019impliquent pas une prise de d\u00e9cision professionnelle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme brevetables.\n[113] Ce n\u2019est cependant pas parce qu\u2019une revendication vise une dose fixe et une fr\u00e9quence d\u2019administration pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019elle est automatiquement brevetable ou qu\u2019elle constitue un objet non brevetable. Une dose fixe et une fr\u00e9quence d\u2019administration pr\u00e9cise peuvent \u00eatre un bon indice ou un bon point de d\u00e9part, mais la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en ce qui concerne le sch\u00e9ma posologique \u2013 y compris la fr\u00e9quence d\u2019administration \u2013 revendiqu\u00e9 peut indiquer que ce dernier ne correspond pas exactement \u00e0 ce qui est revendiqu\u00e9 et que des ajustements faisant appel \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence et au jugement du professionnel peuvent \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaires.\n[114] L\u2019examen des d\u00e9cisions pertinentes confirme l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que les appelantes font des principes tir\u00e9s de la jurisprudence et d\u00e9montre que les tribunaux ont constamment jug\u00e9 qu\u2019une revendication visant l\u2019exercice de la comp\u00e9tence ou du jugement professionnel n\u2019est pas brevetable. Toutefois, une revendication qui ne limite pas l\u2019exercice de la comp\u00e9tence ou du jugement professionnel, n\u2019empi\u00e8te pas sur eux ni ne les fait par ailleurs intervenir \u2013 notamment une revendication portant sur une dose fixe ou une fr\u00e9quence d\u2019administration ou un intervalle posologique pr\u00e9cis \u2013 n\u2019est pas un objet interdit lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve contredisant la posologie revendiqu\u00e9e. Contrairement \u00e0 la conclusion tir\u00e9e par le commissaire et \u00e0 la th\u00e8se de l\u2019intim\u00e9, la d\u00e9cision [Mylan] n\u2019a aucunement chang\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9tat du droit.\n[33] Pharmascience soutient que les observations formul\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision AbbVie au sujet d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pouvant contredire la posologie ou la fr\u00e9quence fixes revendiqu\u00e9es concerne les affaires o\u00f9 la posologie ou la fr\u00e9quence en question pouvaient ne pas \u00eatre efficaces pour tous les patients, de sorte que le m\u00e9decin aurait parfois \u00e0 exercer sa comp\u00e9tence et son jugement pour d\u00e9terminer la posologie appropri\u00e9e. Pharmascience fait valoir qu\u2019un sch\u00e9ma posologique revendiqu\u00e9 qui ne convient pas \u00e0 tous les patients constitue une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical non brevetable. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de cet argument, Pharmascience invoque le passage suivant de la d\u00e9cision AbbVie, au paragraphe 121 :\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, la revendication ne suppose pas que le m\u00e9decin fera appel \u00e0 sa comp\u00e9tence. Les pratiques de prescription ne sont pas assujetties \u00e0 des limites. Le m\u00e9decin doit exercer sa comp\u00e9tence et son jugement pour d\u00e9cider si l\u2019utilisation revendiqu\u00e9e convient \u00e0 son patient. Le m\u00e9decin d\u00e9cide de prescrire le m\u00e9dicament tel quel ou de ne pas le prescrire. S\u2019il le prescrit, l\u2019exercice de sa comp\u00e9tence et de son jugement ne s\u2019en trouve pas restreint. Suivant la preuve, l\u2019administration de la dose pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 des intervalles de deux semaines convient \u00e0 toutes les personnes auxquelles le m\u00e9dicament est administr\u00e9.\n[34] \u00c0 mon sens, la d\u00e9cision AbbVie n\u2019exclut pas, au motif qu\u2019il s\u2019agirait d\u2019une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical non brevetable, toutes les revendications visant un sch\u00e9ma posologique qui pourraient ne pas \u00eatre efficaces pour tous les patients. Cette approche rigide serait incompatible avec la jurisprudence. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, je m\u2019attendrais \u00e0 ce que peu de sch\u00e9mas posologiques pr\u00e9voyant une dose particuli\u00e8re soient efficaces pour tous les patients. \u00c0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision AbbVie portait essentiellement, \u00e0 juste titre, sur la question de savoir si l\u2019on s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce que l\u2019exercice de comp\u00e9tence et de jugement professionnels soit requis pour utiliser l\u2019invention brevet\u00e9e. Dans cette affaire, la Cour n\u2019a trouv\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve en ce sens (voir par. 111).\n[35] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion contraire dans la d\u00e9cision Hoffmann-La Roche Limited c. Sandoz Canada Inc., 2021 CF 384 (Hoffmann). Dans cette d\u00e9cision, la Cour a conclu, au paragraphe 204, que \u00ab la preuve a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il \u00e9tait toujours n\u00e9cessaire que le m\u00e9decin fasse preuve de comp\u00e9tence et de jugement \u00bb. De toute \u00e9vidence, cette question est tributaire des faits; elle d\u00e9pend des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et porte sur la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019invention brevet\u00e9e est destin\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e.\n[36] Il semble qu\u2019une autre difficult\u00e9 possible d\u00e9coule de la d\u00e9cision Novartis. En concluant que les revendications du brevet en cause \u00e9taient invalides, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a not\u00e9, au paragraphe 99, que les revendications englobaient \u00ab le traitement au moyen d\u2019une administration de doses par intermittence et que certaines revendications pr\u00e9cisent un intervalle posologique et d\u2019autres, des doses pr\u00e9cises; \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que certaines revendications revendiquent des intervalles posologiques plus courts et d\u2019autres, plus longs \u00bb. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ajout\u00e9 que les revendications englobaient donc \u00ab ce qui rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence du m\u00e9decin \u00bb. Ce raisonnement donne \u00e0 penser que la Cour, dans la d\u00e9cision Novartis, \u00e9tait consciente que, m\u00eame si certaines revendications individuelles d\u00e9crivaient une posologie et des fr\u00e9quences fixes, les revendications du brevet mises bout \u00e0 bout couvraient une gamme de posologies ou de fr\u00e9quences possibles, de sorte que l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019invention brevet\u00e9e telle qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait revendiqu\u00e9e n\u00e9cessitait effectivement l\u2019exercice de comp\u00e9tence et de jugement. Bien que des paragraphes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents de cette d\u00e9cision aient discut\u00e9 la variabilit\u00e9 de la fr\u00e9quence des doses par intermittence (dans la partie sur la divulgation du brevet), cette variabilit\u00e9 dans une revendication donn\u00e9e n\u2019est pas mentionn\u00e9e au paragraphe 99.\n[37] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, on ne peut d\u00e9terminer si une revendication visant un sch\u00e9ma posologique se rapporte ou non \u00e0 une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical en se fondant exclusivement sur la question de savoir si sa posologie et sa fr\u00e9quence sont fixes ou non. La bonne question \u00e0 poser demeure celle de savoir si l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019invention (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire comment l\u2019utiliser, et non s\u2019il y a lieu de l\u2019utiliser) n\u00e9cessite l\u2019exercice de comp\u00e9tence et de jugement, et le fardeau d\u2019en faire la preuve incombe \u00e0 la partie qui conteste le brevet. Il est difficile de fournir des lignes directrices plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9es aux parties \u00e0 de futurs litiges et aux tribunaux saisis d\u2019all\u00e9gations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 des revendications au motif que ces derni\u00e8res viseraient un objet non brevetable, \u00e0 savoir des m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical. Ces all\u00e9gations reposent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sur les faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au dossier.\nB. Question 1 : Les revendications 1 \u00e0 16 et 33 \u00e0 63 auraient-elles d\u00fb \u00eatre prises en compte dans l\u2019analyse relative aux m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical?\n[38] Au paragraphe 34 de ses motifs, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a divis\u00e9 les revendications du brevet 335 en quatre groupes :\ni. les revendications 1 \u00e0 16 concernent des seringues pr\u00e9remplies adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019administration selon les sch\u00e9mas posologiques revendiqu\u00e9s;\nii. les revendications 17 \u00e0 32 concernent l\u2019emploi d\u2019une \u00ab forme m\u00e9dicamenteuse \u00bb conform\u00e9ment aux sch\u00e9mas posologiques revendiqu\u00e9s;\niii. les revendications 33 \u00e0 48 concernent l\u2019emploi de palip\u00e9ridone sous forme de palmitate de palip\u00e9ridone dans la fabrication et la pr\u00e9paration d\u2019un \u00ab m\u00e9dicament \u00bb adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019administration conform\u00e9ment aux sch\u00e9mas posologiques revendiqu\u00e9s;\niv. les revendications 49 \u00e0 63 concernent l\u2019emploi d\u2019une \u00ab forme m\u00e9dicamenteuse \u00bb adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019administration selon les sch\u00e9mas posologiques revendiqu\u00e9s.\n[39] Au paragraphe 163, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que toutes les revendications \u00e0 l\u2019exception des revendications 17 \u00e0 32 (les autres revendications) \u00e9taient des revendications relatives au produit et non \u00e0 des m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical.\n[40] Pharmascience fait valoir que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en tirant une conclusion sur ce fondement. Elle fait valoir que les autres revendications ne concernent pas un simple produit (des seringues pr\u00e9remplies ou une forme posologique), mais plut\u00f4t un sch\u00e9ma posologique comprenant l\u2019administration constante de doses d\u2019entretien. Pharmascience fait valoir que ces revendications n\u2019auraient pas d\u00fb \u00eatre exclues de l\u2019analyse relative aux m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical.\n[41] \u00c0 mon avis, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur de droit en concluant que les autres revendications ne d\u00e9crivaient pas des m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de revendications relatives au produit. Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 qu\u2019un produit vendable n\u2019est pas une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical. Par cons\u00e9quent, la question est en fait de savoir si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en concluant que les autres revendications visaient un produit vendable. \u00c0 mon avis, une revendication peut concerner un produit vendable m\u00eame si un de ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels est un sch\u00e9ma posologique.\n[42] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a express\u00e9ment expos\u00e9 ses conclusions selon lesquelles les autres revendications \u00e9taient des revendications de produit aux paragraphes 99, 109 et 111 de ses motifs. Je ne suis pas convaincu que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis une erreur \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Les revendications 1 \u00e0 16 concernent des seringues pr\u00e9remplies, qui sont manifestement des produits vendables. Les revendications 33 \u00e0 48 concernent l\u2019utilisation de la palip\u00e9ridone, mais dans la pr\u00e9paration d\u2019un m\u00e9dicament, qui est aussi un produit vendable. Enfin, les revendications 49 \u00e0 63 concernent une forme posologique, qui est encore une fois un produit vendable. Je ne vois aucune raison de modifier la conclusion de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale selon laquelle ces revendications ne visent pas des m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical. Je reconnais le bien-fond\u00e9 de l\u2019argument de Pharmascience selon lequel il serait erron\u00e9 de mettre l\u2019accent sur la forme plut\u00f4t que sur le fond, mais je ne vois rien dans le fond de ces revendications qui soit incompatible avec leur forme en tant que revendications relatives \u00e0 des produits vendables.\n[43] Je ne retiens pas non plus l\u2019all\u00e9gation de Pharmascience selon laquelle ces revendications avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 exclues de l\u2019analyse relative aux m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical. Si les conclusions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au paragraphe 163 peuvent le donner \u00e0 penser, j\u2019estime n\u00e9anmoins qu\u2019elle a examin\u00e9 ces revendications et qu\u2019elle a conclu qu\u2019elles concernaient un produit vendable et qu\u2019elles visaient donc un objet brevetable. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, l\u2019analyse relative aux m\u00e9thodes de traitement m\u00e9dical effectu\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des revendications 17 \u00e0 32 du brevet 335 s\u2019appliquerait \u00e9galement aux autres revendications.\nC. Question 2 : La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que les revendications en question sont brevetables en raison de la dichotomie entre les sch\u00e9mas posologiques fixes et variables?\n[44] La th\u00e8se de Pharmascience \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette question comporte deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments. Premi\u00e8rement, Pharmascience fait valoir que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis une erreur dans sa description de la mani\u00e8re dont les sch\u00e9mas posologiques fixes ou variables sont pertinents lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical. Deuxi\u00e8mement, Pharmascience soutient que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en concluant que les revendications 17 \u00e0 32 du brevet 335 d\u00e9crivaient des posologies et des fr\u00e9quences fixes. J\u2019examine ces deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments s\u00e9par\u00e9ment.\n(1) Pertinence des posologies fixes ou variables\n[45] J\u2019ai analys\u00e9 la jurisprudence applicable \u00e0 cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la question 2 aux paragraphes 27 \u00e0 37 ci-dessus. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette analyse, la description que fait la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du droit concernant les posologies et les fr\u00e9quences fixes, au paragraphe 164 de sa d\u00e9cision (voir la citation au paragraphe 9 ci-dessus), est incompl\u00e8te. D\u00e9terminer si un objet est brevetable ou non ne repose pas n\u00e9cessairement sur la seule question du caract\u00e8re fixe de la posologie et des fr\u00e9quences d\u00e9crites dans la revendication en cause. En fait, la question \u00e0 laquelle il faut r\u00e9pondre est de savoir si l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019invention brevet\u00e9e requiert l\u2019exercice de comp\u00e9tence et de jugement professionnels. Bien qu\u2019une posologie et des fr\u00e9quences fixes puissent \u00eatre un bon indice qu\u2019un tel exercice ne serait pas requis, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve peuvent montrer le contraire.\n[46] Pharmascience attire \u00e9galement l\u2019attention de notre Cour sur le paragraphe 167 de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale :\nComme l\u2019a reconnu l\u2019expert de Pharmascience, le Dr Jeffries, les revendications 17 \u00e0 32 n\u2019emp\u00eachent pas les m\u00e9decins d\u2019utiliser le brevet 335 avec le palmitate de palip\u00e9ridone pour traiter la schizophr\u00e9nie comme ils le faisaient auparavant, [traduction] \u00ab parce qu\u2019ils ne faisaient rien avant \u00bb.\n[47] Je suis plut\u00f4t port\u00e9 \u00e0 convenir avec Pharmascience que cette observation peut \u00eatre utile \u00e0 la question de l\u2019\u00e9vidence, mais qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas utile \u00e0 la question de savoir si les revendications en cause d\u00e9crivent un objet brevetable.\n[48] N\u00e9anmoins, je consid\u00e8re que ni le paragraphe 164 ni le paragraphe 167 ne pr\u00e9sente d\u2019erreur susceptible de contr\u00f4le. \u00c0 mon sens, le paragraphe 167 est un apart\u00e9 qui n\u2019est pas essentiel \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Pour ce qui est du paragraphe 164 et du fait que de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ait omis de mentionner la pertinence potentielle d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve contredisant la nature fixe de la posologie et des fr\u00e9quences d\u00e9crites dans les revendications, je conclus que cela n\u2019a eu aucune incidence sur le r\u00e9sultat. Premi\u00e8rement, le m\u00eame juge (le juge Manson) connaissait cette question pr\u00e9cise, puisqu\u2019il l\u2019avait examin\u00e9e l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente dans la d\u00e9cision Hoffmann, au paragraphe 202. Deuxi\u00e8mement, comme il est expliqu\u00e9 ci-dessous en ce qui concerne le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la question 2, Pharmascience ne m\u2019a pas convaincu que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au dossier \u00e9taient suffisants pour d\u00e9montrer que la posologie et les fr\u00e9quences d\u00e9crites dans les revendications du brevet 335 \u00e9taient de nature fixe. Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale fasse \u00e9tat de cette nuance dans le crit\u00e8re juridique, mais je ne consid\u00e8re pas que cette omission constitue une erreur susceptible de contr\u00f4le.\n[49] Aux paragraphes 168 \u00e0 171 de sa d\u00e9cision, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00fbment examin\u00e9 la question de savoir si l\u2019utilisation des revendications n\u00e9cessitait l\u2019exercice de comp\u00e9tence et de jugement. Au paragraphe 171, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00fbment reconnu la distinction entre l\u2019exercice de comp\u00e9tence et de jugement pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019utiliser l\u2019invention et l\u2019exercice de la comp\u00e9tence et du jugement pour d\u00e9cider comment utiliser l\u2019invention.\n(2) La conclusion que les revendications 17 \u00e0 32 d\u00e9crivent des posologies et des fr\u00e9quences fixes\n[50] Pharmascience souligne qu\u2019au paragraphe 162 de ses motifs, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale reconna\u00eet que des doses diff\u00e9rentes peuvent \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaires pour diff\u00e9rents patients et que, par cons\u00e9quent, le brevet 335 ne d\u00e9crit pas un sch\u00e9ma posologique fixe. Pharmascience soutient que le sch\u00e9ma brevet\u00e9 n\u2019est pas une solution et constitue donc une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical. Comme il est indiqu\u00e9 plus haut, dans la discussion sur la d\u00e9cision AbbVie, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e que, parce que la posologie fixe n\u2019est pas efficace pour certains patients, il s\u2019ensuit automatiquement que l\u2019invention constitue une m\u00e9thode de traitement m\u00e9dical non brevetable. Comme je l\u2019indique \u00e0 plusieurs reprises dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, la question qu\u2019il faut poser est de savoir si l\u2019exercice d\u2019une comp\u00e9tence et d\u2019un jugement est n\u00e9cessaire pour utiliser l\u2019invention.\n[51] Pharmascience renvoie \u00e9galement \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments des revendications du brevet 335 o\u00f9 la posologie et les fr\u00e9quences sont variables pour soutenir qu\u2019il faut conclure que l\u2019invention ne se limite pas \u00e0 une posologie et \u00e0 des fr\u00e9quences fixes. Un exemple est la fen\u00eatre pr\u00e9vue dans les revendications 17 \u00e0 32 pour la deuxi\u00e8me dose d\u2019attaque ([traduction] \u00ab une semaine \u00b1 2 jours apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re dose d\u2019attaque \u00bb) et pour les doses d\u2019entretien ([traduction] \u00ab administration chaque mois \u00b1 7 jours apr\u00e8s la deuxi\u00e8me dose d\u2019attaque \u00bb). Pharmascience fait valoir que les revendications indiquent donc en fait que la deuxi\u00e8me dose doit \u00eatre administr\u00e9e entre le jour 6 et le jour 10 et que la dose d\u2019entretien doit \u00eatre administr\u00e9e de 23 \u00e0 37 jours apr\u00e8s la deuxi\u00e8me dose.\n[52] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est pench\u00e9e sur cet argument au paragraphe 170 de ses motifs, mais a conclu que ces choix n\u2019ont aucune incidence clinique et sont l\u00e0 pour permettre une certaine souplesse dans l\u2019administration du m\u00e9dicament. Sur ce fondement, la Cour a conclu que les revendications n\u2019entraveraient pas l\u2019exercice par un m\u00e9decin de sa comp\u00e9tence et de son jugement. Je ne vois l\u00e0 aucune erreur de droit, et Pharmascience n\u2019affirme pas qu\u2019une erreur manifeste et dominante ou une erreur mixte de fait et de droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wellcome, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que les revendications qui d\u00e9finissaient la posologie pr\u00e9vue par les termes de [traduction] \u00ab quantit\u00e9 efficace \u00bb visaient des objets brevetables bien qu\u2019elles aient clairement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une certaine variabilit\u00e9.\n[53] Pharmascience fait valoir un argument semblable en ce qui concerne la souplesse quant \u00e0 l\u2019emplacement de l\u2019injection de la dose d\u2019entretien mensuelle, qui peut \u00eatre dans [traduction] \u00ab un muscle delto\u00efde ou un muscle fessier \u00bb. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion \u2013 qu\u2019il lui \u00e9tait loisible de tirer \u2013 selon laquelle ce choix n\u2019a aucune incidence clinique et n\u2019entrave pas l\u2019exercice par un m\u00e9decin de sa comp\u00e9tence et de son jugement.\n[54] Pharmascience fait \u00e9galement valoir que la partie sur la divulgation du brevet 335 indique qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu que les m\u00e9decins exercent leur comp\u00e9tence et leur jugement concernant l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019invention. Elle met en \u00e9vidence le passage suivant de la divulgation, \u00e0 la page 12, lignes 23 \u00e0 25 :\n[traduction]\nLes personnes vers\u00e9es dans l\u2019art comprendront que la dose d\u2019entretien peut \u00eatre ajust\u00e9e \u00e0 la hausse ou \u00e0 la baisse en fonction de l\u2019\u00e9tat des patients (r\u00e9ponse au m\u00e9dicament et fonction r\u00e9nale).\n[55] Dans la jurisprudence, l\u2019ajustement est invoqu\u00e9 comme fondement de la conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une invention exige l\u2019exercice de comp\u00e9tence et de jugement : voir les d\u00e9cisions Mylan et Hoffmann. Toutefois, \u00e0 mon avis, cette phrase est insuffisante pour que je conclus \u00e0 l\u2019erreur susceptible de contr\u00f4le en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. M\u00eame si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9tait tenue d\u2019examiner l\u2019effet de cette phrase dans son examen du brevet 335 dans son ensemble, cette phrase n\u2019exige pas que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale conclue que l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019invention revendiqu\u00e9e exige l\u2019exercice de comp\u00e9tence et de jugement. Encore une fois, je ne vois l\u00e0 aucune erreur de droit, et Pharmascience n\u2019affirme pas qu\u2019une erreur manifeste et dominante de fait ou mixte de fait et de droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise.\n[56] Un autre argument potentiel li\u00e9 \u00e0 la variabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue dans le brevet 335 est la diff\u00e9rence entre les posologies pour les patients atteints d\u2019insuffisance r\u00e9nale et les posologies pour les patients non atteints d\u2019insuffisance r\u00e9nale. Toutefois, il semble qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019une distinction objective qui n\u2019implique pas l\u2019exercice par un m\u00e9decin de sa comp\u00e9tence et de son jugement. Cela montre en fait que le brevet pr\u00e9voit un sch\u00e9ma posologique diff\u00e9rent pour les patients atteints d\u2019insuffisance r\u00e9nale.\nD. Port\u00e9e de l\u2019injonction\n[57] Une derni\u00e8re question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e \u00e0 titre d\u2019argument subsidiaire dans le m\u00e9moire des faits et du droit de Pharmascience concerne la port\u00e9e de l\u2019injonction qu\u2019a accord\u00e9e la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans son jugement. Cette question n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e verbalement \u00e0 l\u2019audience, mais elle n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e.\n[58] Pharmascience fait valoir que l\u2019injonction est d\u2019une port\u00e9e trop vaste, en ce sens qu\u2019elle couvre des activit\u00e9s qui ne rel\u00e8vent pas des droits exclusifs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par les brevets et \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 42 de la Loi sur les brevets, \u00e0 savoir le droit de fabriquer, de construire, d\u2019exploiter et de vendre l\u2019invention.\n[59] L\u2019injonction accord\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale figure au paragraphe 4 de son jugement :\nPar injonction accord\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019expiration du brevet 335, le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2028, il est interdit \u00e0 Pharmascience, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 ses filiales et soci\u00e9t\u00e9s affili\u00e9es, dirigeants, administrateurs, employ\u00e9s, mandataires, licenci\u00e9s, successeurs, cessionnaires et toute autre personne sur qui Pharmascience exerce une autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gitime :\nde fabriquer, de construire, d\u2019exploiter ou de vendre du pms\u2011PALIPERIDONE PALMITATE au Canada, selon ce qui est indiqu\u00e9 aux PADN nos 244641 et 251767;\nde mettre en vente, commercialiser ou faire commercialiser le pms\u2011PALIPERIDONE PALMITATE au Canada, selon ce qui est indiqu\u00e9 aux PA[DN] nos 244641 et 251767;\nd\u2019importer, d\u2019exporter, de distribuer ou de faire distribuer le pms\u2011PALIPERIDONE PALMITATE au Canada, selon ce qui est indiqu\u00e9 aux PA[DN] nos 244641 et 251767.\n[60] En fait, Pharmascience s\u2019oppose \u00e0 ce que l\u2019injonction lui interdise les actes suivants \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019objet brevet\u00e9 en cause : (i) le mettre en vente; (ii) le commercialiser; (iii) le mettre en march\u00e9; (iv) l\u2019importer; (v) l\u2019exporter; (vi) le distribuer; et (vii) le faire distribuer.\n[61] Pharmascience n\u2019a pas vraiment expliqu\u00e9 en quoi ces activit\u00e9s ne rel\u00e8veraient pas des droits exclusifs du brevet\u00e9. Je note que notre Cour a r\u00e9cemment accord\u00e9 une injonction de port\u00e9e semblable contre Apotex Inc. dans une action parall\u00e8le impliquant Janssen et le brevet 335 (Janssen Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2023 CAF 253). Les paragraphes 64 \u00e0 70 de cet arr\u00eat expliquent les motifs pour lesquels une injonction de cette port\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e.\n[62] Je fais \u00e9galement observer, tout comme Janssen, que Pharmascience n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 cette question dans son avis d\u2019appel.\n[63] Je rejetterais l\u2019argument subsidiaire de Pharmascience concernant la port\u00e9e de l\u2019injonction, tant parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel que pour les motifs expos\u00e9s aux paragraphes 64 \u00e0 70 de l\u2019arr\u00eat mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 61 ci-dessus.\nVI. Conclusion\n[64] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je rejetterais le pr\u00e9sent appel. J\u2019adjugerais \u00e0 Janssen des d\u00e9pens de 10 000 $, tout compris.\n\u00ab George R.

En ordonnant que Bell et TCI fournissent temporairement acc\u00e8s \u00e0 leurs installations FTTP au moyen de services d\u2019acc\u00e8s haute vitesse de gros group\u00e9s, la d\u00e9cision du CRTC exige de Bell et de TCI (dans le cas de cette derni\u00e8re, uniquement pour un nombre relativement petit de clients) qu\u2019elles donnent acc\u00e8s temporairement \u00e0 des revendeurs concurrents, au moyen de services group\u00e9s, \u00e0 leurs installations de fibre en Ontario et au Qu\u00e9bec qui permettent aux clients d\u2019avoir un acc\u00e8s par fil \u00e0 Internet haute vitesse. Le CRTC \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019ainsi les concurrents pourraient vendre des services d\u2019Internet haute vitesse en Ontario et au Qu\u00e9bec qui feraient concurrence \u00e0 ceux offerts par Bell et TCI. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le CRTC a \u00e9galement fix\u00e9 temporairement les tarifs de gros que Bell et TCI pouvaient facturer aux revendeurs pour les services group\u00e9s d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 leurs installations FTTP.\n[4] En 2015, le CRTC a ordonn\u00e9 que les entreprises dot\u00e9es d\u2019installations, dont Bell et TCI, fournissent des services FTTP d\u00e9group\u00e9s aux revendeurs et a fix\u00e9 les tarifs qui pouvaient \u00eatre factur\u00e9s pour ces services.\n[5] La diff\u00e9rence entre les services d\u2019acc\u00e8s group\u00e9s et d\u00e9group\u00e9s est bien r\u00e9sum\u00e9e par Bell, aux paragraphes 18 et 19 des observations \u00e9crites qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate :\n[traduction]\n18. Les entreprises dot\u00e9es d\u2019installations investissent notamment dans deux types d\u2019installations : le transport et l\u2019acc\u00e8s. Les installations de transport permettent que de grandes quantit\u00e9s de trafic de donn\u00e9es soient envoy\u00e9es et re\u00e7ues dans tout le r\u00e9seau de fibres optiques. On peut les comparer aux autoroutes ou aux lignes de transmission d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. Les installations d\u2019acc\u00e8s, par contraste, sont celles qui connectent le lieu o\u00f9 se trouve le client (c.-\u00e0-d. les locaux) au r\u00e9seau de fibres optiques. On peut les comparer aux routes locales ou aux lignes de distribution d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9.\n19. Traditionnellement, le CRTC r\u00e9glemente deux types de services Internet de gros utilisant ces installations :\n(a) les services Internet de gros group\u00e9s : ils permettent aux revendeurs de louer une combinaison (i) d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux installations dont ils ont besoin pour brancher les locaux du client et (ii) d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux installations de transport par lesquelles de grandes quantit\u00e9s de trafic de donn\u00e9es peuvent \u00eatre envoy\u00e9es ou re\u00e7ues. Avant la d\u00e9cision du CRTC, les services de gros group\u00e9s \u00e9taient offerts pour le service Internet de fibre optique jusqu\u2019au n\u0153ud (un bon service Internet, mais pas aussi bon que le service FTTP), mais pas pour le service FTTP, qui est une technologie \u00e9mergente que les entreprises dot\u00e9es d\u2019installations utilisent pour fournir les services Internet les plus rapides dont ils disposent;\n(b) les services Internet de gros d\u00e9group\u00e9s : ils permettent aux revendeurs de louer seulement l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux installations dont ils ont besoin pour connecter les locaux du client, mais pas l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux installations de transport. \u00c0 la place, les concurrents doivent obtenir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des installations de transport soit en investissant dans leurs propres r\u00e9seaux [\u2026] soit en louant des installations d\u2019une autre entreprise sur une base commerciale. Les services de gros d\u00e9group\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts pour les installations FTTP pendant un certain temps, mais, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, aucun des concurrents de Bell ne s\u2019en est pr\u00e9valu.\n[6] Selon certains des intim\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, l\u2019option des services d\u2019acc\u00e8s d\u00e9group\u00e9s aux installations FTTP \u00e9tait inex\u00e9cutable parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait trop ch\u00e8re pour eux selon les modalit\u00e9s fix\u00e9es par le CRTC en 2015.\n[7] Le 9 f\u00e9vrier 2023, le gouverneur en conseil a pris un d\u00e9cret en vertu de l\u2019article 8 de la Loi sur les t\u00e9l\u00e9communications, L.C. 1993, ch. 38, intitul\u00e9 D\u00e9cret donnant au CRTC des instructions sur une approche renouvel\u00e9e de la politique de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication : DORS\/2023-23, enregistr\u00e9 le 10 f\u00e9vrier 2023 (C.P. 2023-110 le 9 f\u00e9vrier 2023) (le d\u00e9cret).\n[8] L\u2019article 10 de ce d\u00e9cret est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi :\nService d\u2019acc\u00e8s haute vitesse de gros group\u00e9\nAggregated wholesale high-speed access service\n10 Le Conseil doit rendre obligatoire la fourniture de services d\u2019acc\u00e8s haute vitesse de gros group\u00e9 \u2014 qui s\u2019ajoutent \u00e0 tout autre type de service d\u2019acc\u00e8s de gros \u00e0 haut d\u00e9bit dont la fourniture est obligatoire \u2014 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il d\u00e9termine qu\u2019une concurrence vaste, durable et significative perdurera m\u00eame si la fourniture d\u2019un service group\u00e9 n\u2019est plus obligatoire.\n10 The Commission must mandate the provision of an aggregated wholesale high-speed access service \u2014 that is additional to any other types of wholesale high-speed access services that are mandated \u2014 until it determines that broad, sustainable and meaningful competition will persist even if the provision of an aggregated service is no longer mandated.\n[9] Le 7 mars 2023, le CRTC a publi\u00e9 l\u2019avis de consultation de t\u00e9l\u00e9com CRTC 2023-56. Dans cet avis, le CRTC a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il allait examiner le cadre existant de services d\u2019acc\u00e8s haute vitesse (AHV) de gros \u00ab compte tenu des conditions changeantes du march\u00e9, des d\u00e9fis consid\u00e9rables dans la mise en \u0153uvre du cadre et de l\u2019importance pour la population canadienne d\u2019avoir plus de choix et des services plus abordables \u00bb. Le CRTC a \u00e9galement exprim\u00e9 les avis pr\u00e9liminaires suivants :\ni) la fourniture de services AHV de gros group\u00e9s devrait \u00eatre obligatoire; ii) l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux installations par fibre jusqu\u2019aux locaux des abonn\u00e9s (FTTP) devrait \u00eatre offert pour ces services; et iii) la fourniture d\u2019installations FTTP au moyen des services AHV de gros group\u00e9s devrait \u00eatre obligatoire temporairement et de mani\u00e8re acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le Conseil parvienne \u00e0 tirer une conclusion \u00e0 savoir si un tel acc\u00e8s doit \u00eatre offert ind\u00e9finiment.\n[10] Dans son avis de consultation, le CRTC a invit\u00e9 les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00e0 formuler des commentaires. Plus de 300 entreprises et individus ont fait conna\u00eetre leur point de vue au CRTC, dont Bell et les intim\u00e9es qui ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des observations dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, soit TekSavvy Solutions inc. (TekSavvy), Qu\u00e9becor M\u00e9dia inc. au nom de Vid\u00e9otron lt\u00e9e (QMI) et Op\u00e9rateurs de r\u00e9seaux concurrentiels canadiens (ORCC).\n[11] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le CRTC a confirm\u00e9, en partie, ses avis pr\u00e9liminaires sur la mesure temporaire qu\u2019elle envisageait d\u2019imposer. En cons\u00e9quence, le CRTC a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Bell et \u00e0 TCI de fournir aux revendeurs concurrents acc\u00e8s \u00e0 leurs installations FTTP pour les services d\u2019AHC de gros group\u00e9s, en Ontario et au Qu\u00e9bec, au plus tard le 7 mai 2024, de mani\u00e8re temporaire en attendant l\u2019issue de l\u2019examen g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du CRTC \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du cadre des services d\u2019AHV.\n[12] Dans son analyse, le CRTC a not\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, le nombre d\u2019abonn\u00e9s aux services FTTP de Bell avait augment\u00e9 consid\u00e9rablement et que l\u2019intensit\u00e9 de la concurrence dans ce secteur avait d\u00e9clin\u00e9. Il a conclu qu\u2019ordonner temporairement l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux services d\u2019acc\u00e8s FTTP group\u00e9s aiderait \u00e0 stabiliser la concurrence. Il s\u2019est \u00e9galement dit d\u2019avis que \u00ab le fait que les concurrents n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en mesure de fournir des services au moyen de r\u00e9seaux FTTP a grandement nui \u00e0 leur capacit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer une concurrence efficace \u00bb. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00ab craint que cette incidence n\u00e9gative sur la concurrence fond\u00e9e sur les services de gros va s\u2019aggraver encore avec le temps \u00bb et que, \u00ab [s]ans intervention r\u00e9glementaire, une v\u00e9ritable concurrence dans les services fond\u00e9s sur les services de gros continuera de diminuer \u00bb (d\u00e9cision du CRTC, au para. 57).\n[13] Le CRTC a limit\u00e9 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019acc\u00e8s temporaire obligatoire aux installations FTTP en Ontario et au Qu\u00e9bec, au motif que ces deux r\u00e9gions sont celles \u00ab o\u00f9 la concurrence fond\u00e9e sur les services de gros est le plus manifestement en d\u00e9clin \u00bb (d\u00e9cision du CRTC, aux paras. 59 et 68).\n[14] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le CRTC a pris en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019observation de Bell selon laquelle elle pourrait ne pas \u00eatre en mesure de recouvrer les co\u00fbts de mise en \u0153uvre associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la fourniture d\u2019acc\u00e8s temporaire \u00e0 ses installations FTTP pour les services d\u2019AHV de gros group\u00e9s si cet acc\u00e8s n\u2019\u00e9tait pas rendu obligatoire de fa\u00e7on permanente. Le CRTC a jug\u00e9 que ces difficult\u00e9s, si elles devaient survenir, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00ab pas insurmontables d\u2019un point de vue r\u00e9glementaire \u00bb. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00ab pr\u00eat \u00e0 traiter ces questions plus tard au besoin \u00bb (d\u00e9cision du CRTC, au para. 67).\n[15] Le contexte \u00e9tant \u00e9tabli, je passe \u00e0 l\u2019examen de la requ\u00eate en tant que telle.\n[16] Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9, Bell demande un sursis \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du CRTC jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que soit tranch\u00e9e sa demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel visant cette d\u00e9cision et, si l\u2019autorisation est accord\u00e9e, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019appel soit tranch\u00e9. Si la requ\u00eate de Bell est accueillie, Bell ne serait pas tenue de fournir \u00e0 ses concurrents l\u2019acc\u00e8s temporaire \u00e0 ses installations FTTP pour les services d\u2019AHV de gros group\u00e9s en Ontario et au Qu\u00e9bec jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que notre Cour se prononce sur la requ\u00eate en autorisation d\u2019appel de la d\u00e9cision du CRTC et, si l\u2019autorisation est accord\u00e9e, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019appel soit tranch\u00e9.\n[17] TekSavvy, QMI et ORCC s\u2019opposent \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\n[18] Le crit\u00e8re applicable aux sursis comme celui demand\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est bien connu et n\u00e9cessite que la partie requ\u00e9rante \u00e9tablisse : (1) que l\u2019appel soul\u00e8ve une question s\u00e9rieuse; (2) qu\u2019elle subirait un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable si le sursis \u00e9tait refus\u00e9; et (3) que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients penche en faveur du sursis : RJR-MacDonald Inc c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 1994 CanLII 117 (CSC), [1994] 1 R.C.S. 311, \u00e0 la p. 334 (RJR-MacDonald); Canada c. Conseil canadien pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, 2008 CAF 40, 2008 CarswellNat 3303, au para. 18 (Conseil canadien pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s). Les trois conditions ci-dessus doivent \u00eatre remplies pour que le tribunal accorde le sursis.\n[19] Le seuil applicable \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re condition, soit l\u2019existence d\u2019une question s\u00e9rieuse, est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement peu \u00e9lev\u00e9. Ce seuil est atteint dans les affaires, comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, o\u00f9 les questions soulev\u00e9es dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel ne sont pas frivoles ou vexatoires : RJR-MacDonald, \u00e0 la p. 348; Conseil canadien pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, aux paras. 18 et 22. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je suis pr\u00eate \u00e0 accepter, pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, que l\u2019avis d\u2019appel de Bell soul\u00e8ve au moins une question s\u00e9rieuse.\n[20] Cependant, je conclus que Bell n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019elle subirait un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable si le sursis \u00e9tait refus\u00e9. La deuxi\u00e8me condition n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019octroi du sursis demand\u00e9 n\u2019est donc pas remplie.\n[21] Le pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable renvoie \u00e0 la nature, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue, du pr\u00e9judice que subira la partie si le sursis est rejet\u00e9. Il doit y avoir une \u00ab une forte probabilit\u00e9 que, faute de sursis, un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable soit in\u00e9vitablement caus\u00e9 \u00bb : voir Arctic Cat, Inc. c.

Comme notre Cour l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 au paragraphe 24 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Janssen, \u00ab il serait \u00e9trange qu\u2019une partie faisant valoir un pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019elle a elle\u2011m\u00eame caus\u00e9, un pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019elle aurait pu ou pourrait encore \u00e9viter ou un pr\u00e9judice auquel elle aurait pu ou pourrait encore rem\u00e9dier, puisse justifier un redressement de si grave port\u00e9e [qu\u2019apporterait le sursis] \u00bb.\n[23] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a donn\u00e9 des exemples du type de pr\u00e9judice qui peut s\u2019av\u00e9rer irr\u00e9parable parce qu\u2019il ne peut \u00eatre quantifi\u00e9. On y trouve notamment les situations o\u00f9 la partie demandant le sursis perdra son entreprise, subira une perte commerciale permanente ou verra sa r\u00e9putation commerciale entach\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re irr\u00e9versible : voir RJR-MacDonald\u00b8 \u00e0 la p. 341, renvoyant \u00e0 R.L.

Il en est ainsi puisque, comme l\u2019avait conclu le juge Stratas au paragraphe 48 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Shotclose :\nIl est beaucoup trop facile pour ceux qui demandent un sursis dans une affaire comme celle\u2011ci d\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9rer diverses difficult\u00e9s, de les qualifier de graves, puis, au moment de pr\u00e9ciser le pr\u00e9judice qui risque d\u2019en d\u00e9couler, d\u2019employer des termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et expressifs qui ne servent pour l\u2019essentiel qu\u2019\u00e0 affirmer \u2013 et non \u00e0 prouver \u00e0 la satisfaction de la Cour \u2013 que le pr\u00e9judice est irr\u00e9parable.\n[26] Bell note que notre Cour a reconnu le pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable dans des ordonnances ayant sursis \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de certaines d\u00e9cisions du CRTC en attendant l\u2019appel.

Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CAF 56, 2011 CarswellNat 8229, notre Cour a sursis \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision du CRTC qui aurait eu pour r\u00e9sultat la perte d\u2019une fr\u00e9quence radio en demande dans un march\u00e9 fortement contest\u00e9, ce qui aurait vraisemblablement mis en p\u00e9ril l\u2019existence d\u2019une station de radio universitaire.\n[27] Comme il appara\u00eet clairement ci-apr\u00e8s, les affaires ci-dessus sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[28] Bell renvoie aussi \u00e0 deux ordonnances rendues verbalement qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9es, dont celle rendue par notre Cour en 2019 dans le dossier 19-A-59. Cependant, parce qu\u2019elles sont br\u00e8ves, ces ordonnances ne fournissent ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre d\u2019indication quant aux circonstances pertinentes ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 leur prononc\u00e9, sauf l\u2019affirmation selon laquelle la Cour \u00e9tait convaincue que les ordonnances de sursis \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires pour pr\u00e9venir une distorsion du march\u00e9 : dossier de requ\u00eate de Bell, onglet 4, pi\u00e8ces H et I de l\u2019affidavit de Sonia Atwell. Par contre, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le CRTC a rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans le but de corriger une telle distorsion et de pr\u00e9server la concurrence dans le march\u00e9 de l\u2019Internet haute vitesse en Ontario et au Qu\u00e9bec.\n[29] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Bell ne fait valoir que des affirmations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales quant au pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019elle pourrait subir si le sursis n\u2019\u00e9tait pas accord\u00e9 et ne pr\u00e9sente pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suffisamment probants dont il ressort une forte probabilit\u00e9 que, faute de sursis, un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable sera in\u00e9vitablement caus\u00e9.\n[30] Bell affirme qu\u2019elle subira trois types de pr\u00e9judices qui, selon elle, seront irr\u00e9parables si elle se conforme \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du CRTC : (1) elle perdra des clients et des revenus; (2) elle devra d\u00e9bourser des co\u00fbts pour la mise en \u0153uvre de la d\u00e9cision du CRTC, lesquels seront irr\u00e9couvrables; (3) elle devra reporter ou annuler d\u2019autres projets. Cependant, Bell n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suffisamment d\u00e9taill\u00e9s et probants que ces pr\u00e9judices seraient irr\u00e9parables.\n[31] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de ses all\u00e9gations de pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable, Bell se fonde sur un affidavit de sa vice-pr\u00e9sidente principale des Services technologiques, Anuja Sheth (l\u2019affidavit de Mme Sheth), lequel est conjectural et manque d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant le pr\u00e9judice que Bell pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle subira si le sursis est refus\u00e9. Bell se fonde \u00e9galement sur l\u2019affidavit d\u2019un auxiliaire juridique qui inclut en pi\u00e8ce jointe, entre autres choses, certains documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans l\u2019affaire devant le CRTC, ainsi qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision et d\u2019autres documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans l\u2019affaire devant le Tribunal de la concurrence concernant la fusion entre Rogers et Shaw, soit Canada (Commissaire de la concurrence) c. Rogers Communications Inc. et Shaw Communications Inc., 2023 Trib Conc 1, conf. par 2023 CAF 16, 2023 CarswellNat 170 (Fusion Rogers Shaw).\n[32] La plupart des pr\u00e9judices all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans l\u2019affidavit de Mme Sheth sont fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se que le CRTC, \u00e0 la fin de son examen g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, n\u2019ordonnera pas de mani\u00e8re permanente \u00e0 Bell de donner acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ses installations FTTP au moyen de services AHV de gros group\u00e9s. \u00c0 ce moment-ci, c\u2019est de la pure conjecture.\n[33] En ce qui concerne plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment chacun des pr\u00e9judices all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, Bell ne fournit pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, documentaire ou autre, montrant en d\u00e9tail comment ou pourquoi elle perdrait vraisemblablement des clients ou des revenus de fa\u00e7on permanente. Bien que l\u2019affidavit de Mme Sheth mentionne, en passant, des pertes estim\u00e9es et hypoth\u00e9tiques, elle pr\u00e9sente peu d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments, voire aucun, justifiant les sommes ou les effets all\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\n[34] L\u2019estimation de Bell ne comporte pas les nuances requises. Par exemple, comme TekSavvy le souligne, les chiffres pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Bell ne font aucune distinction entre les diff\u00e9rents types de clients. Il n\u2019y a pas de distinction entre d\u2019une part les clients qui pourraient abandonner un concurrent fond\u00e9 sur les services de gros utilisant les lignes d\u2019acc\u00e8s d\u00e9di\u00e9es de Bell pour se tourner vers un concurrent fond\u00e9 sur les services de gros utilisant les installations FTTP de Bell, d\u2019autre part les clients qui pourraient se tourner vers un concurrent fond\u00e9 sur les services de gros qui utilise aussi les services FTTP de Bell ou encore les personnes qui ne sont pas des clients et qui pourraient s\u2019abonner \u00e0 un concurrent fond\u00e9 sur les services de gros utilisant les installations FTTP de Bell. Dans chacun de ces exemples, Bell gagnerait des revenus de vente de gros pour ces clients, mais les estimations g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es dans l\u2019affidavit de Mme Sheth n\u2019en tiennent pas compte.\n[35] \u00c0 mon avis, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur les pertes potentielles de parts de march\u00e9 produits par Bell dans l\u2019affidavit de Mme Sheth se comparent aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans l\u2019affaire Gateway City Church. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019\u00ab \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suffisamment probants, dont il ressort une forte probabilit\u00e9 que, faute de sursis, un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable soit in\u00e9vitablement caus\u00e9 \u00bb : Gateway City Church, au para. 16. Cet affidavit comprend plusieurs hypoth\u00e8ses et conjectures qui ne sont pas \u00e9tay\u00e9es par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et qui par cons\u00e9quent \u00ab n\u2019ont aucune valeur probante \u00bb : voir Glooscap, au para. 31.\n[36] Bell fonde \u00e9galement ses arguments relatifs \u00e0 la perte de parts de march\u00e9 et de revenus sur certains documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce devant le CRTC par TekSavvy et ORCC ainsi que sur la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal de la concurrence dans l\u2019affaire Fusion Rogers Shaw et des documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans cette affaire. Pourtant, aucun de ces documents n\u2019\u00e9tablit de forte probabilit\u00e9 que Bell perdra de mani\u00e8re irr\u00e9vocable des parts de march\u00e9 ou des revenus. Bien que le CRTC ait eu l\u2019intention, par sa d\u00e9cision, d\u2019accro\u00eetre la concurrence dans ce secteur, et que TekSavvy et ORCC aient indiqu\u00e9 dans leurs observations au CRTC qu\u2019elles croyaient que l\u2019acc\u00e8s temporaire envisag\u00e9 par le CRTC \u00e9tait requis, cela n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas de forte probabilit\u00e9 que Bell perdra des parts de march\u00e9 ou des revenus de mani\u00e8re permanente. Les intim\u00e9es font valoir de mani\u00e8re convaincante dans leurs documents en r\u00e9ponse que la possible intensification de la concurrence ne se traduira pas n\u00e9cessairement par une perte de parts de march\u00e9 pour Bell. En outre, Bell n\u2019a pas offert de pr\u00e9cisions montrant comment les tarifs de gros temporaires fix\u00e9s par le CRTC se comparent aux prix apr\u00e8s les rabais que Bell offre d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 certains de ses abonn\u00e9s.\n[37] Pour ce qui est de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal de la concurrence dans l\u2019affaire Fusion Rogers Shaw et des documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans cette affaire, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la d\u00e9claration de t\u00e9moin en r\u00e9ponse de Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lescadres, je ne vois pas comment ils prouvent quoi que ce soit de pertinent, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que cette affaire portait sur des services, des march\u00e9s et des questions qui diff\u00e8rent consid\u00e9rablement. Bien que le Tribunal de la concurrence ait reconnu que l\u2019acquisition de VMedia, un revendeur, par Vid\u00e9otron est un indice des plans d\u2019expansion en Ontario de Vid\u00e9otron, Bell n\u2019a pas offert d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve liant cette expansion \u00e0 une perte permanente de ses parts de march\u00e9 ou de ses revenus.\n[38] En ce qui concerne les co\u00fbts de mise en \u0153uvre irr\u00e9couvrables, l\u2019assurance du CRTC qu\u2019il peut r\u00e9soudre ces difficult\u00e9s, si n\u00e9cessaire, r\u00e9pond compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 cet argument, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Bell n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve montrant comment ou pourquoi le CRTC serait incapable de le faire. L\u2019affidavit de Mme Sheth n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas de mani\u00e8re convaincante que le CRTC ne pourrait pas fixer par ordonnance de nouveaux tarifs qui permettraient \u00e0 Bell de recouvrer les co\u00fbts engag\u00e9s pour mettre en \u0153uvre l\u2019acc\u00e8s temporaire si le CRTC d\u00e9cidait de ne pas ordonner de mani\u00e8re permanente de tel acc\u00e8s aux installations FTTP de Bell au moyen des services AHV de gros group\u00e9s \u00e0 la fin de son examen g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la politique.\n[39] Enfin, le propre choix de Bell de rediriger ou de couper des investissements ne constitue pas un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable, mais plut\u00f4t le choix d\u2019entreprise qu\u2019elle semble avoir fait en cons\u00e9quence de la d\u00e9cision du CRTC. En l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrant que la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019acc\u00e8s temporaire mettrait en danger l\u2019existence m\u00eame de Bell, je ne vois pas en quoi le fait qu\u2019elle proc\u00e8de aux investissements n\u00e9cessaires pour la mise en \u0153uvre de la d\u00e9cision du CRTC plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u2019autres investissements constitue un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable.\n[40] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, Bell n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u00e0 la satisfaction de la Cour \u00ab l\u2019existence r\u00e9elle d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice qui ne pourra \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9 plus tard, ou une r\u00e9elle probabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019un tel pr\u00e9judice soit subi \u00bb : Shotclose, au para. 48. Ses affirmations sont trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rales pour remplir la deuxi\u00e8me condition du crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald.\n[41] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les conditions du crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald sont conjonctives, l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de Bell d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019elle subira un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable signifie que la requ\u00eate en sursis doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que je me penche sur la troisi\u00e8me condition du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald, soit la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients.\n[42] Par cons\u00e9quent, je vais rejeter la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate et adjuger une seule s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9pens payables par Bell en parts \u00e9gales \u00e0 chacune des intim\u00e9es TekSavvy, QMI et ORCC.\n\u00ab Mary J.L.

Macciacchera, j\u2019en viens \u00e0 la conclusion que leur requ\u00eate devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e parce qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas les moyens de se payer un avocat et, par cons\u00e9quent, ils ne m\u2019ont pas convaincu que des circonstances particuli\u00e8res existent.\n[6] Comme il est indiqu\u00e9 au paragraphe 5 de la d\u00e9cision Alpha, \u00ab [l]a capacit\u00e9 de [la requ\u00e9rante] de s\u2019offrir les services d\u2019un avocat constitue sans doute le facteur le plus important dont la Cour doit tenir compte \u00bb.\n[7] Comme il est indiqu\u00e9 au paragraphe 4 de l\u2019arr\u00eat El Mocambo Rocks Inc. c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des auteurs, compositeurs et \u00e9diteurs de musique (SOCAN), 2012 CAF 98, \u00ab [l]a d\u00e9monstration qu\u2019une personne morale n\u2019a pas les moyens de se payer un avocat devrait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement se faire par la pr\u00e9sentation de renseignements financiers clairs et complets concernant la personne morale, de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence au moyen d\u2019\u00e9tats financiers \u00bb.\n[8] MM. Macciacchera tentent de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas les moyens de se payer un avocat au paragraphe 11 de leurs observations \u00e9crites. M\u00eame s\u2019ils soutiennent qu\u2019ils sont r\u00e9solus \u00e0 poursuivre le pr\u00e9sent appel et que de nombreuses \u00e9tapes menant \u00e0 la tenue d\u2019une audience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 achev\u00e9es, ils n\u2019all\u00e8guent pas qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas les moyens de se payer un avocat. Ils ne fournissent aucun renseignement financier.\n[9] Je reconnais que les intim\u00e9es ne s\u2019opposent pas \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de MM. Macciacchera. Toutefois, m\u00eame si ce facteur peut \u00eatre pertinent dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019une requ\u00eate au titre de l\u2019article 120 des R\u00e8gles, il n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminant. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, cette non-opposition ne l\u2019emporte pas sur l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tablissant que MM. Macciacchera n\u2019ont pas les moyens de se payer un avocat.\n[10] Le rejet de la requ\u00eate de MM. Macciacchera a des r\u00e9percussions sur la poursuite du pr\u00e9sent appel. Sans repr\u00e9sentation, les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s appelantes ne peuvent pas agir. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ordonnerai, comme l\u2019a fait le juge Donald J. Rennie dans son ordonnance du 8 d\u00e9cembre 2023, que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s appelantes nomment un nouvel avocat au dossier, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 124 des R\u00e8gles, et ce, dans un d\u00e9lai de 30 jours.\n[11] Je fais \u00e9galement remarquer qu\u2019une demande d\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 8 janvier 2024. M\u00eame s\u2019il y est indiqu\u00e9 que la demande est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au nom de tous les appelants, elle ne peut pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au nom des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s appelantes puisque ces derni\u00e8res n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u00fbment repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ordonnerai, comme l\u2019a fait le juge Rennie dans son ordonnance du 8 d\u00e9cembre 2023, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une nouvelle demande d\u2019audience, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 347 des R\u00e8gles, dans les 30 jours suivant la nomination du nouvel avocat.\n\u00ab George R.

Aux termes de son jugement, le juge Boyle rejetait des requ\u00eates de l\u2019appelant visant \u00e0 obtenir la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019appels log\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cotisations \u00e9mises \u00e0 son endroit pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 1999 \u00e0 2002 et 2005 mais \u00e9ventuellement r\u00e9gl\u00e9s par le syndic de faillite de l\u2019appelant en 2014. Ce r\u00e8glement a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la production, par le syndic, d\u2019avis de d\u00e9sistement dans chaque dossier.\n[2] L\u2019Entente sur le contenu du dossier d\u2019appel est, \u00e0 toutes fins utiles, le dernier acte de proc\u00e9dure utile produit au pr\u00e9sent dossier. Cela remonte au 20 septembre 2022.\n[3] L\u2019intim\u00e9 demande donc \u00e0 la Cour, dans une requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2023, de rejeter le pr\u00e9sent appel pour cause de retard injustifi\u00e9. Il en demande \u00e9galement le rejet sur la base qu\u2019il n\u2019a par ailleurs aucune chance de succ\u00e8s. Sur ce dernier point, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019avis d\u2019appel produit en l\u2019instance ne soul\u00e8ve aucune erreur de la part du juge Boyle. Par surcroit, dit-il, le pr\u00e9sent appel s\u2019ajouterait \u00e0 une longue liste de proc\u00e9dures initi\u00e9es sans succ\u00e8s par l\u2019appelant dans d\u2019autres dossiers le concernant ou concernant des personnes li\u00e9es, en vue de faire annuler les jugements rendus dans ces affaires ou remettre en cause des conclusions qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9es.\n[4] L\u2019appelant, qui, depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, est impliqu\u00e9 dans de nombreux litiges, de nature civile et p\u00e9nale, avec l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019ARC) et qui se dit victime \u00ab depuis 2006 \u00bb d\u2019une \u00ab fraude majeure \u00bb de la part de cette derni\u00e8re, a d\u2019abord pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour d\u00e9p\u00f4t, le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2023, ce qui se voulait son dossier de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Or, ce dossier a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u, mais non d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par le greffe de la Cour en raison de sa non-conformit\u00e9 aux exigences applicables des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, DORS\/98-106 (les R\u00e8gles). Le 22 d\u00e9cembre 2023, l\u2019intim\u00e9, pour les m\u00eames raisons, s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 au d\u00e9p\u00f4t dudit dossier. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a aussi contest\u00e9 le mode de signification utilis\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 72(1)b) des R\u00e8gles, le greffe a sollicit\u00e9 de la Cour une directive quant \u00e0 savoir si le dossier de r\u00e9ponse pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour d\u00e9p\u00f4t par l\u2019appelant devait \u00eatre accept\u00e9 ou refus\u00e9. J\u2019y reviendrai plus loin dans ces motifs.\n[5] Le 9 janvier 2024, l\u2019appelant a choisi de d\u00e9poser sa propre requ\u00eate dans l\u2019espoir de \u00ab corriger la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pour rejet d\u2019appel et de faire une mise \u00e0 jour avec de nombreuses nouvelles preuves \u00bb puisqu\u2019il lui paraissait n\u00e9cessaire de \u00ab refaire l\u2019affidavit et les pi\u00e8ces conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 306 des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales \u00bb.\n[6] L\u2019appelant, qui se repr\u00e9sente lui-m\u00eame, fait fausse route pour deux raisons. Premi\u00e8rement, sa requ\u00eate est fond\u00e9e sur les r\u00e8gles r\u00e9gissant les demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, lesquelles n\u2019ont aucune application en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un appel que l\u2019appelant a log\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la d\u00e9cision du juge Boyle. En appel, le \u00ab dossier \u00bb qui est devant la Cour est le \u00ab Dossier d\u2019appel \u00bb, tel que constitu\u00e9 aux termes des articles 343 et 344 des R\u00e8gles. Il n\u2019est pas constitu\u00e9 des affidavits et pi\u00e8ces des parties, comme ce serait le cas si la Cour \u00e9tait saisie d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. La requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelant d\u00e9note une incompr\u00e9hension des r\u00e8gles applicables. Il en r\u00e9sulte un vice de forme et de fond qui, \u00e0 lui seul, pourrait justifier son rejet.\n[7] Deuxi\u00e8mement, et plus important encore, m\u00eame en supposant la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelant r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement devant la Cour, on n\u2019y trouve rien qui satisfasse aux crit\u00e8res r\u00e9gissant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve nouvelle en appel, lesquels sont pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 351 des R\u00e8gles, tel qu\u2019interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 par la Cour. C\u2019est le cas aussi du dossier de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet d\u2019appel de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour d\u00e9p\u00f4t par l\u2019appelant.\n[8] Pour satisfaire \u00e0 ces crit\u00e8res, l\u2019appelant devait d\u00e9montrer que les nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019il souhaite introduire au dossier \u00ab 1) [\u2026] n\u2019auraient pas pu \u00eatre produits au proc\u00e8s avec diligence raisonnable, 2) [\u2026] sont pertinents, en ce sens qu\u2019ils portent sur une question d\u00e9cisive ou potentiellement d\u00e9cisive quant \u00e0 l\u2019appel, 3) [\u2026] sont plausibles, en ce sens qu\u2019on peut raisonnablement y ajouter foi, et 4) [\u2026] sont tels que si l\u2019on y ajoute foi, on peut raisonnablement penser qu\u2019ils auraient influ\u00e9 sur le r\u00e9sultat : Palmer c. la Reine, [1980] 1 R.C.S. 759, page 775, 1979 CanLII 8; May c. \u00c9tablissement Ferndale, 2005 CSC 82, [2005] 3 R.C.S. 809, au paragraphe 1071) \u00bb (Coady c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale), 2019 CAF 102 au para. 3 (Coady)).\n[9] Ce test est exigeant et l\u2019appelant devait en faire plus que de se contenter d\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9s vagues et g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. La principale lacune tient au fait qu\u2019on ne sait pas ce qui a emp\u00each\u00e9 l\u2019appelant, en faisant preuve de diligence raisonnable, de produire ses nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments au proc\u00e8s, surtout que l\u2019on sait du dossier que cette preuve aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverte \u00ab entre 2020 et 2022 \u00bb. On ne sait pas davantage si ces nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve portent sur une \u00ab question d\u00e9cisive ou potentiellement d\u00e9cisive quant \u00e0 l\u2019appel \u00bb. Cela, \u00e0 mon sens, est fatal \u00e0 la d\u00e9marche de l\u2019appelant. Le fait que l\u2019appelant ait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 sous le couvert d\u2019une demande de prorogation de d\u00e9lai n\u2019y change rien puisqu\u2019il demeurait tenu de d\u00e9montrer, notamment, que sa demande de pr\u00e9sentation de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve avait un certain m\u00e9rite (Alberta c. Canada, 2018 CAF 83, au para. 44, citant Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Hennelly (1999), 244 N.R. 399 (C.A.F.)). Or, cette d\u00e9monstration, comme on vient de le voir, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\n[10] La Cour devrait-elle toutefois exercer sa discr\u00e9tion et permettre le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve malgr\u00e9 le fait que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas satisfait aux crit\u00e8res de l\u2019article 351 des R\u00e8gles (Coady au para. 3)? J\u2019estime que non pour les raisons qui suivent.\n[11] Je note, du dossier de requ\u00eate produit par l\u2019intim\u00e9, que l\u2019approche emprunt\u00e9e ici par l\u2019appelant a toutes les allures du modus operandi observ\u00e9 dans d\u2019autres dossiers o\u00f9 chaque fois qu\u2019un jugement lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favorable, l\u2019appelant a invoqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9couverte de faits nouveaux en vue de le faire annuler ou encore a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9chapper aux cons\u00e9quences du jugement en ayant recours \u00e0 des moyens dilatoires. Je renvoie \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e0 la description qu\u2019en a fait la juge Roussel, maintenant juge \u00e0 notre Cour, dans Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (Re), 2018 CF 1012, au jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec dans Laquerre c. R., 2021 QCCA 157, et \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance rendue le 27 juin 2023 par la juge Rochester, aussi maintenant juge \u00e0 notre Cour, dans les dossiers de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale T-1594-06 et T-699-07. Toutes ces tentatives ont \u00e9chou\u00e9.\n[12] Je note aussi que dans son ordonnance, la juge Rochester n\u2019a pas manqu\u00e9 de souligner n\u2019avoir \u00ab aucun doute que [l\u2019appelant avait] eu toutes les opportunit\u00e9s de faire valoir ses droits depuis 2008 \u00bb et que \u00ab [m]algr\u00e9 cela, il persist[ait] \u00e0 utiliser les ressources judiciaires limit\u00e9es de la Cour pour des requ\u00eates non fond\u00e9es pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu de la R\u00e8gle 399 \u00bb. Il est utile de le rappeler que cette r\u00e8gle, et plus particuli\u00e8rement son paragraphe 399(2), permet de faire annuler une ordonnance dans les cas o\u00f9 \u00ab des faits nouveaux sont survenus ou ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s que l\u2019ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue \u00bb ou dans ceux o\u00f9 \u00ab l\u2019ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue par fraude \u00bb.\n[13] Il est utile de rappeler \u00e9galement que c\u2019est exactement ce qu\u2019a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 faire valoir l\u2019appelant, sous forme de requ\u00eates en r\u00e9ouverture de dossiers fond\u00e9es sur la d\u00e9couverte de faits nouveaux, devant le juge Boyle et, tout r\u00e9cemment, sans succ\u00e8s aussi, devant son coll\u00e8gue, le juge Gagnon, dans Fiducie Mario Laquerre c. Le Roi, 2024 CCI 5.\n[14] Dans un tel contexte, la plus grande vigilance est de mise et milite contre l\u2019exercice de la discr\u00e9tion r\u00e9siduaire d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019article 351 des R\u00e8gles. En d\u2019autres termes, il n\u2019y a pas mati\u00e8re \u00e0 relever l\u2019appelant du d\u00e9faut d\u2019avoir satisfait aux exigences de cette disposition. Sa requ\u00eate sera donc rejet\u00e9e.\n[15] Je reviens \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Normalement, le retard \u00e0 agir dans une proc\u00e9dure institu\u00e9e devant cette Cour est constat\u00e9 par un Avis de l\u2019examen de l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019instance \u00e9mis en vertu de l\u2019article 382.2 des R\u00e8gles. Cet avis enclenche alors une proc\u00e9dure de justification du d\u00e9lai \u00e0 agir qui peut mener soit au rejet de l\u2019acte introductif d\u2019instance, que ce soit un appel ou une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, soit \u00e0 la poursuite de l\u2019instance suivant les directives \u00e9mises par la Cour et le calendrier \u00e9tabli par elle. Aucun tel avis n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ce qui me fait h\u00e9siter \u00e0 faire droit \u00e0 ce volet de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Quant au volet li\u00e9 au fait que le pr\u00e9sent appel n\u2019aurait aucune chance de succ\u00e8s, j\u2019h\u00e9site aussi \u00e0 le consid\u00e9rer parce qu\u2019il invite \u00e0 un examen du fond de l\u2019appel alors que la Cour ne dispose que de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel pour ce faire. L\u2019\u00e9chantillon est donc trop mince pour faire un examen utile et complet des chances de succ\u00e8s, au m\u00e9rite, du pr\u00e9sent appel.\n[16] Ceci \u00e9tant dit, je ne rejetterai pas la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9; je vais la suspendre. En effet, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il s\u2019agit ici, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019historique judiciaire de l\u2019appelant, tel qu\u2019il se d\u00e9gage des affaires cit\u00e9es dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs auxquels il \u00e9tait parti, directement ou par l\u2019entremise de parties li\u00e9es, d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 la Cour doit exercer, d\u2019office, sa comp\u00e9tence pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re, laquelle lui conf\u00e8re les pouvoirs n\u00e9cessaires, au-del\u00e0 de ceux qui lui sont d\u00e9volus par la loi, pour assurer le bon d\u00e9roulement des instances devant elle de mani\u00e8re, notamment, \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir les abus de proc\u00e9dure (Dugr\u00e9 c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2021 CAF 8 aux para. 20-21).\n[17] Je vais donc permettre la poursuite du pr\u00e9sent appel, avec en arri\u00e8re-plan la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Toutefois, je vais assujettir l\u2019appel \u00e0 un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier que l\u2019appelant devra respecter \u00e0 la lettre. \u00c0 cette fin, les parties auront dix (10) jours \u00e0 compter de la date de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance pour s\u2019entendre sur un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier et le d\u00e9poser pour approbation par la Cour.\n[18] Cet \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier devra comprendre les \u00e9tapes suivantes :\na)Confection (\u00e0 partir de l\u2019entente sur le contenu du dossier d\u2019appel d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 22 septembre 2022) et d\u00e9p\u00f4t du Dossier d\u2019appel (article 345 des R\u00e8gles);\nb)Signification et d\u00e9p\u00f4t du m\u00e9moire des faits et du droit de l\u2019appelant (paragraphe 346(1) des R\u00e8gles);\nc)Signification et d\u00e9p\u00f4t du m\u00e9moire des faits et du droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9 (paragraphe 346(2) des R\u00e8gles);\nd)Signification et d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la demande d\u2019audience (article 347 des R\u00e8gles); et\ne)Signification et d\u00e9p\u00f4t du\/des cahier-s des lois, r\u00e8glements, jurisprudence et doctrine (article 348 des R\u00e8gles).\n[19] Si les parties n\u2019arrivent pas \u00e0 s\u2019entendre, la Cour, une fois le d\u00e9lai de dix (10) jours expir\u00e9, imposera alors un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier aux parties sans autre avis ni d\u00e9lai.\n[20] Une fois l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier \u00e9tabli, l\u2019intim\u00e9, en cas de d\u00e9faut de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 le respecter, aura le loisir de resoumettre sa requ\u00eate en rejet par l\u2019envoi \u2013 et la signification \u2013 d\u2019une simple lettre au greffe de la Cour. L\u2019appelant aura alors sept (7) jours \u00e0 compter de la date de signification de la lettre de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour signifier et d\u00e9poser une justification acceptable de son retard \u00e0 agir. Si la justification avanc\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas acceptable aux yeux de la Cour \u2013 ou si l\u2019appelant fait d\u00e9faut d\u2019en produire une dans ledit d\u00e9lai \u2013 le pr\u00e9sent appel pourra \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, sans autre avis ni d\u00e9lai.\n[21] Par ailleurs, pour plus de clart\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la suite des choses, l\u2019examen du jugement du juge Boyle devra \u00e9ventuellement se faire, comme l\u2019intim\u00e9 le mentionne \u00e0 juste titre dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelant, \u00e0 partir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019il avait devant lui, du moins ceux qui sont r\u00e9pertori\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019entente sur le contenu du dossier d\u2019appel d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en septembre 2022. Il appartiendra alors \u00e0 la Cour de d\u00e9terminer si, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve qu\u2019il avait devant lui, le juge Boyle, en rejetant les requ\u00eates en r\u00e9ouverture de dossiers de l\u2019appelant, a commis une erreur justifiant son intervention.\n[22] Finalement, quant au sort du dossier de r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet d\u2019appel, je n\u2019en ai pas autoris\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t dans une directive \u00e9mise en date de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, en raison de ses nombreuses lacunes : aucun intitul\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019affidavit, pi\u00e8ces non\u2011asserment\u00e9es ou non\u2011mentionn\u00e9es dans l\u2019affidavit, dossier non\u2011pagin\u00e9, absence d\u2019une table des mati\u00e8res et documents ne respectant pas l\u2019ordre dans lequel ils doivent apparaitre au dossier.\n[23] Toutefois, cela, \u00e0 mon sens, est sans cons\u00e9quence puisque j\u2019ai consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelant, laquelle visait \u00e0 rectifier le tir de sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet.\n[24] Il n\u2019y aura pas d\u2019adjudication de d\u00e9pens, puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne les a pas demand\u00e9s dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelant.\n\u00ab Ren\u00e9 LeBlanc \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\nA-168-22\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nMARIO LAQUERRE c.

La division d\u2019appel a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de la demanderesse, Diane Beaurivage, d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale (la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale). L\u2019appel devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale concernait une d\u00e9cision de la Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada (la Commission) qui a rejet\u00e9 une demande de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi par Mme Beaurivage puisqu\u2019elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait toujours de l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire pay\u00e9 par son employeur apr\u00e8s la fin de son emploi.\n[2] Nous sommes d\u2019avis que la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e est celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. Nous ne retenons pas l\u2019argument de Mme Beaurivage que la norme de contr\u00f4le devrait plut\u00f4t \u00eatre celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte. Devant notre Cour, la pr\u00e9somption en mati\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le judiciaire veut que nous consid\u00e9rions la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e suivant la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. \u00c0 notre avis, et contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019argument de Mme Beaurivage, les questions soulev\u00e9es dans cette demande ne figurent pas parmi les exceptions \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9somption \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653 (Vavilov). Mais quoi qu\u2019il en soit, nous sommes d\u2019avis que, quelle que soit la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable, cette affaire ne peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[3] D\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, il est utile de rappeler ce qui suit quant aux r\u00f4les de la division d\u2019appel et la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. La division d\u2019appel peut accorder un appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale seulement dans les cas o\u00f9 cette derni\u00e8re (i) n\u2019a pas observ\u00e9 un principe de justice naturelle ou a autrement exc\u00e9d\u00e9 ou refus\u00e9 d\u2019exercer sa comp\u00e9tence, (ii) a rendu une d\u00e9cision entach\u00e9e d\u2019une erreur de droit, ou (iii) a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une conclusion de fait erron\u00e9e, tir\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance : Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l'emploi et du d\u00e9veloppement social, L.C. 2005, c. 34, art. 58. Le r\u00f4le de la division d\u2019appel est donc limit\u00e9. \u00c0 titre comparatif, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale entend un appel de la Commission de novo : Page c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2023 CAF 169, 483 D.L.R. (4th) 742 au para. 17. Sa d\u00e9cision n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre limit\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision de la Commission.\n[4] Mme Beaurivage affirme que la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e en sa faveur compte tenu du fait qu\u2019en 2016 la Commission lui avait accord\u00e9 des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi, tout en \u00e9tant pleinement consciente qu\u2019elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire pay\u00e9 par son employeur. Nous ne pouvons pas retenir cet argument. Premi\u00e8rement, il est loin d\u2019\u00eatre clair que la Commission est li\u00e9e, lorsqu\u2019elle d\u00e9cide une demande de prestations, par une d\u00e9cision sur une autre demande de prestations faite dans le pass\u00e9 par la m\u00eame personne. Chaque demande d\u2019assurance-emploi est tributaire des faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission et du droit applicable au moment o\u00f9 la demande est faite. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je note que dans sa d\u00e9cision, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision de la division d\u2019appel (R.B. c. Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada, 2018 TSS 754) qui semble appuyer la d\u00e9cision de la Commission dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier en ce qui concerne l\u2019usage du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire de Mme Beaurivage pour les fins de la demande de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi en cause ici. Mme Beaurivage a par ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e d\u2019une autre d\u00e9cision de la division d\u2019appel au m\u00eame effet pendant une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique le 14 ao\u00fbt 2020 (voir la page 40 du dossier de la demanderesse).\n[5] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, puisque l\u2019appel d\u2019une telle d\u00e9cision devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est de novo, il est clair que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure de la Commission. Donc, la division d\u2019appel avait raison de conclure que la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion ne s\u2019appliquait pas dans ce cas.\n[6] En ce qui concerne l\u2019argument subsidiaire de Mme Beaurivage qu\u2019il y a aussi un abus de proc\u00e9dure, nous arrivons \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion, et ce, pour les m\u00eames raisons d\u00e9crites ci-dessus.\n[7] Mme Beaurivage demande aussi, dans le cas o\u00f9 nous ne retenons pas ses arguments sur le fond de sa demande, que nous recommandions \u00e0 la Commission \u00ab d\u2019user [de] son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et d\u2019ordonner la d\u00e9falcation des sommes dues dans tous les dossiers afin de mettre fin au litige avec la Demanderesse \u00bb. Nous refusons cette demande. Le r\u00f4le de cette Cour est d\u2019entendre des demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire des d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale sur des appels des d\u00e9cisions de la Commission. Il serait inappropri\u00e9 de donner suite \u00e0 la recommandation vis\u00e9e par Mme Beaurivage, surtout que cette question pourrait \u00e9ventuellement \u00eatre port\u00e9e devant notre Cour.\n[8] En conclusion, nous rejetons la demande. Puisque le d\u00e9fendeur ne demande pas des d\u00e9pens, nous n\u2019en accordons aucun.\n\u00ab George R.

La plainte concernait la nomination d\u2019une tierce partie \u00e0 un poste auquel s\u2019int\u00e9ressait Mme Fortin.\n[2] La Commission a rejet\u00e9 la plainte parce qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai prescrit.

Apr\u00e8s avoir indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait une explication \u00e9crite (vraisemblablement en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience), une telle explication lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie le 28 juillet 2022. Toutefois, il semble que cette explication ne l\u2019a pas satisfaite; elle a simplement reformul\u00e9 sa question.\n[4] Le d\u00e9lai pour pr\u00e9senter une plainte concernant la nomination contest\u00e9e expirait le 28 juillet 2022, soit 15 jours suivant la date figurant sur la notification : art. 10 du R\u00e8glement concernant les plaintes relatives \u00e0 la dotation dans la fonction publique, DORS\/2006-6 (le R\u00e8glement). Mme Fortin n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa plainte que le 3 ao\u00fbt 2022.\n[5] Suite au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, le SCC a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de la rejeter pour non-respect du d\u00e9lai. Le SCC s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande subs\u00e9quente de Mme Fortin pour proroger ce d\u00e9lai. Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u des courriels de Mme Fortin les 9, 10 et 11 ao\u00fbt 2022 portant sur les d\u00e9fis caus\u00e9s par sa d\u00e9ficience, la Commission a conclu, tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, que le d\u00e9lai pour d\u00e9poser la plainte n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9, et que le crit\u00e8re de circonstances exceptionnelles n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait. En particulier, la Commission a not\u00e9 que \u00ab la plaignante avait la responsabilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser sa plainte dans le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu et elle n'a pas expliqu\u00e9 comment sa d\u00e9ficience a cr\u00e9\u00e9 des circonstances exceptionnelles l'emp\u00eachant de respecter ce d\u00e9lai. \u00bb\n[6] La norme de contr\u00f4le applicable \u00e0 cette demande est celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable, sauf en ce qui concerne des questions d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale: Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653. Ceci veut dire que, pour les questions qui ne concernent pas l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, nous n\u2019interviendrons que dans le cas o\u00f9 Mme Fortin nous convainc que les motifs de la Commission sont d\u00e9raisonnables. Notre r\u00f4le, il est important de le noter, n\u2019est pas de refaire la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. En d\u2019autres termes, il n\u2019est pas de r\u00e9\u00e9valuer la demande qui \u00e9tait devant la Commission, et d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 notre propre conclusion sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de cette demande. Pour les questions d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, nous nous demandons si la proc\u00e9dure devant la Commission \u00e9tait \u00e9quitable.\n[7] \u00c0 mon avis, il \u00e9tait loisible \u00e0 la Commission, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve qu\u2019elle avait devant elle, de conclure au non-respect du d\u00e9lai de 15 jours. Elle pouvait aussi conclure \u00e0 l\u2019absence de circonstances exceptionnelles en raison du manque de preuve concernant le lien entre sa d\u00e9ficience et le non-respect du d\u00e9lai.\n[8] Mme Fortin reconnait qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli ce lien devant la Commission, mais affirme que cette lacune d\u00e9montre en soi son incapacit\u00e9. M\u00eame si j\u2019acceptais son argument, je suis d\u2019avis que la Commission pouvait n\u00e9anmoins raisonnablement conclure, selon la preuve qui \u00e9tait devant elle, que le crit\u00e8re de circonstances exceptionnelles n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait.\n[9] Mme Fortin note qu\u2019elle se repr\u00e9sentait seule devant la Commission, et affirme que si une audience avait eu lieu quant \u00e0 sa demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e de l\u2019importance de fournir la preuve m\u00e9dicale, ce qu\u2019elle aurait fait. Ceci semble \u00eatre un argument d\u2019un manquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale d\u00fb au d\u00e9faut de tenir une audience avant que la Commission ne rende sa d\u00e9cision. Je note que l\u2019article 27 du R\u00e8glement pr\u00e9voit que la Commission est \u00ab ma\u00eetre de la proc\u00e9dure \u00bb, et qu\u2019elle peut d\u00e9cider de la mani\u00e8re dont la preuve sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. \u00c0 mon avis, la Commission n\u2019avait aucune obligation de tenir une audience. Mme Fortin a eu l\u2019occasion de d\u00e9poser des repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites qui \u00e9tayaient sa position. Dans les circonstances, on ne peut reprocher \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019avoir manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son devoir d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de Mme Fortin.\n[10] Mme Fortin all\u00e8gue aussi que la Commission l\u2019a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en ne prenant aucune mesure d\u2019adaptation en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Je ne peux pas retenir cet argument puisqu\u2019il est circulaire. En l\u2019absence de preuve devant la Commission de la pertinence de sa d\u00e9ficience quant au non-respect du d\u00e9lai, celle-ci n\u2019avait aucune raison de croire qu\u2019une mesure d\u2019adaptation \u00e9tait souhaitable. La Commission n\u2019a pas err\u00e9 non plus \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[11] Je conclus en notant que m\u00eame les rapports m\u00e9dicaux soumis avec le dossier de Mme Fortin n\u2019indiquent pas qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait incapable de respecter le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu. Tel qu\u2019il appert de son m\u00e9moire et de ses repr\u00e9sentations \u00e0 l\u2019audience, je note \u00e9galement que bien des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de justification du non-respect du d\u00e9lai n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Commission. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, Mme Fortin indique, aux paragraphes 39 et suivants de son m\u00e9moire, qu\u2019avec le recul, elle est maintenant en mesure de mieux expliquer \u00e0 la Cour les raisons de son d\u00e9faut \u00e0 respecter ce d\u00e9lai, et ce, dans l\u2019espoir que, par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, cette Cour proroge elle-m\u00eame ledit d\u00e9lai. Malheureusement pour elle, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, notre r\u00f4le se limite \u00e0 examiner la d\u00e9cision de la Commission \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qu\u2019elle avait devant elle. En d\u2019autres mots, nous ne pouvons rendre la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la place de la Commission \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de faits qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019occasion de consid\u00e9rer.\n[12] Pour les raisons ci-dessus, et malgr\u00e9 la sympathie que j\u2019\u00e9prouve pour Mme Fortin, je suis d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est raisonnable, et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas enfreint l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Je rejetterais la demande, incluant toutes les r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es par Mme Fortin.\n[13] Puisque le d\u00e9fendeur ne demande pas des d\u00e9pens, je n\u2019en accorderais aucun.\n[14] Je suis d\u2019accord avec le d\u00e9fendeur que l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de cause devrait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 pour remplacer le Commissaire du service correctionnel du Canada par le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada.\n\u00ab George R.

Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2017 CF 43, [2017] A.C.F. no 24 (Q.L.) (la juge St-Louis) (le Jugement). Aux termes du Jugement, la juge rejetait la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire introduite par l\u2019appelante \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une d\u00e9cision (la D\u00e9cision) de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) concluant, en vertu du sous-alin\u00e9a 44(3)b)(i) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, c. H-6 (la Loi), qu\u2019un examen de sa plainte pour discrimination, repr\u00e9sailles et harc\u00e8lement (la Plainte) de la part de son ancien employeur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9, compte tenu des circonstances.\n[2] Dans le Jugement, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en appliquant la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte \u00e0 un aspect de la d\u00e9cision discr\u00e9tionnaire de la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019examen par le Tribunal de la Plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9 compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la Plainte \u2013 \u00e0 savoir si la Commission pouvait exclure de son traitement de la Plainte les all\u00e9gations de violation d\u2019un protocole d\u2019entente conclu par les parties pour r\u00e9gler une plainte ant\u00e9rieure \u2013 et en substituant aux motifs de la Commission sa propre justification du r\u00e9sultat obtenu par la Commission. Me mettant \u00e0 la place de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et appliquant la norme de contr\u00f4le appropri\u00e9e, je conclus que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est d\u00e9raisonnable parce que ses motifs sur cet aspect de la D\u00e9cision ne font pas \u00e9tat d\u2019une analyse rationnelle et parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019ensemble du droit et des faits pertinents. Cependant, j\u2019exercerais mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de r\u00e9paration en n\u2019annulant pas la D\u00e9cision et en ne renvoyant pas l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la Commission pour une nouvelle d\u00e9cision puisque la seule d\u00e9cision raisonnable, compte tenu des contraintes juridiques et factuelles applicables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, serait de rejeter la Plainte.\nI. Contexte [3] Il sera utile de pr\u00e9senter le contexte entourant les questions soulev\u00e9es dans le pr\u00e9sent appel.\nA. Contexte l\u00e9gislatif [4] La Loi interdit plusieurs actes discriminatoires. Notamment, elle interdit, \u00e0 l\u2019article 7, le fait de refuser de continuer d\u2019employer un individu ou de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi pour un motif de distinction illicite, dont la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et la couleur. La Loi interdit \u00e9galement, \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)a), le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi pour un motif de distinction illicite. \u00c0 l\u2019article 14.1, la Loi interdit \u00e0 la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte de discrimination sous la Loi, ou la personne qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[5] Aux termes du paragraphe 40(1), sous r\u00e9serve de certaines conditions de recevabilit\u00e9 qui ne sont pas applicables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les personnes ayant des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019une personne a commis un acte discriminatoire peuvent d\u00e9poser une plainte devant la Commission.\n[6] Lorsqu\u2019elle re\u00e7oit une plainte, la Commission peut refuser de statuer sur la plainte dont elle est saisie si elle la juge irrecevable pour un des motifs d\u00e9finis au paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi :\nIrrecevabilit\u00e9\nCommission to deal with complaint\n41 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 40, la Commission statue sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle estime celle-ci irrecevable pour un des motifs suivants :\n41 (1) Subject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that\na) la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de l\u2019acte discriminatoire devrait \u00e9puiser d\u2019abord les recours internes ou les proc\u00e9dures d\u2019appel ou de r\u00e8glement des griefs qui lui sont normalement ouverts;\n(a) the alleged victim of the discriminatory practice to which the complaint relates ought to exhaust grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available;\nb) la plainte pourrait avantageusement \u00eatre instruite, dans un premier temps ou \u00e0 toutes les \u00e9tapes, selon des proc\u00e9dures pr\u00e9vues par une autre loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale;\n(b) the complaint is one that could more appropriately be dealt with, initially or completely, according to a procedure provided for under an Act of Parliament other than this Act;\nc) la plainte n\u2019est pas de sa comp\u00e9tence;\n(c) the complaint is beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission;\nd) la plainte est frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi;\n(d) the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith; or\ne) la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration d\u2019un d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an apr\u00e8s le dernier des faits sur lesquels elle est fond\u00e9e, ou de tout d\u00e9lai sup\u00e9rieur que la Commission estime indiqu\u00e9 dans les circonstances.\n(e) the complaint is based on acts or omissions the last of which occurred more than one year, or such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances, before receipt of the complaint.\n[7] En vertu du paragraphe 43(1), la Commission peut charger une personne (\u00ab l\u2019enqu\u00eateur \u00bb) d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur une plainte et, une fois l\u2019enqu\u00eate termin\u00e9e, de pr\u00e9senter un rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e0 la Commission selon le paragraphe 44(1).\n[8] La Commission exerce alors un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, d\u00e9fini aux paragraphes 44(2) et (3), pour d\u00e9cider comment donner suite au rapport. L\u2019une des options pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 44(3) est de demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal des droits de la personne (\u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte. Le Tribunal tient alors une audience, donnant \u00e0 la Commission et aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et leurs observations afin de trancher les questions de fait et de droit soulev\u00e9es par la plainte. L\u2019autre option est de rejeter la plainte si la Commission est convaincue que son examen n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des circonstances applicables ou que la plainte n\u2019est pas recevable pour un des motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s aux alin\u00e9as 41(1)c) \u00e0 e).\n[9] L\u2019article 48 de la Loi traite de la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e8glements. Elle pr\u00e9voit que les parties peuvent tenter de r\u00e9gler leurs diff\u00e9rends \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte mais avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience au Tribunal : Loi, art. 48(1). Tout r\u00e8glement doit \u00eatre approuv\u00e9 par la Commission, apr\u00e8s quoi, par requ\u00eate d\u2019une des parties ou de la Commission, il peut \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 comme telle: Loi, art. 48(2)\u2013(3).\nB. Contexte factuel [10] Cet appel s\u2019inscrit dans la foul\u00e9e d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de proc\u00e9dures judiciaires et administratives intent\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante sur une p\u00e9riode de vingt ans devant la Commission, le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un traitement par son ancien employeur qu\u2019elle juge avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 discriminatoire. Afin de replacer le Jugement dans son contexte factuel, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner l\u2019historique de ces proc\u00e9dures.\n(1) La plainte de 2003 et le protocole d\u2019entente [11] L\u2019appelante, Mme Marie Mache Rameau, a \u0153uvr\u00e9 dans la fonction publique du Canada de 1990 \u00e0 2014 quand son poste a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019un r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement des effectifs. L\u2019appelante a notamment travaill\u00e9 au sein de l\u2019Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international (l\u2019ACDI), qui fait \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent partie d\u2019Affaires mondiales Canada.\n[12] Le 28 juillet 2003, l\u2019appelante d\u00e9pose aupr\u00e8s de la Commission une premi\u00e8re plainte (la plainte de 2003) all\u00e9guant qu\u2019en cours d\u2019emploi, l\u2019ACDI s\u2019est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 de la discrimination et \u00e0 du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9s sur la race contrairement aux articles 7 et 14 de la Loi. La Commission achemine la plainte de 2003 au Tribunal en d\u00e9cembre 2005.\n[13] Avant que la plainte de 2003 ne soit instruite devant le Tribunal et \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation, les parties signent, le 29 novembre 2006, un protocole d\u2019entente (le protocole) pour r\u00e9soudre les all\u00e9gations soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte de 2003.\n[14] Au paragraphe 10 du protocole, l\u2019appelante convient que ce dernier \u00ab repr\u00e9sente un r\u00e8glement d\u00e9finitif [\u00e0] l\u2019\u00e9gard de tous les incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans [la plainte de 2003] et lib\u00e8re et d\u00e9charge pour toujours l\u2019intim\u00e9e [\u2026] de toute r\u00e9clamation ou cause d\u2019action d\u00e9coulant des all\u00e9gations faites dans la plainte. \u00bb\n[15] Les parties pr\u00e9voient aux paragraphes 14 \u00e0 16 du protocole les moyens par lesquels ce r\u00e8glement sera ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 :\n14. Les parties reconnaissent que la Commission fera le suivi du r\u00e8glement, une fois approuv\u00e9, afin d\u2019assurer la mise en \u0153uvre des modalit\u00e9s tel que convenues dans cette entente.\n15. Les parties consentent \u00e0 ce que ce r\u00e8glement soit assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et soit ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 comme telle en vertu du paragraphe 48(3) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n16. Une fois le r\u00e8glement approuv\u00e9 par la Commission, dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d\u2019un d\u00e9saccord concernant la mise en \u0153uvre de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ses conditions, les parties conviennent de reprendre la m\u00e9diation afin de ren\u00e9gocier les points en litige. Les parties conviennent \u00e9galement que la modification sera soumise [\u00e0] l\u2019approbation de la Commission conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 48 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et que celle-ci aura force ex\u00e9cutoire en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale selon les m\u00eames modalit\u00e9s que le r\u00e8glement initial.\n[16] La Commission approuve l\u2019entente et le 17 janvier 2007, le Tribunal arr\u00eate les proc\u00e9dures et ferme son dossier.\n[17] En vertu des paragraphes 4 et 5 du protocole, l\u2019appelante est nomm\u00e9e \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire dans un poste au groupe et niveau PE-04 et affect\u00e9e dans un poste au sein de la Commission de la fonction publique (CFP) pour une p\u00e9riode de 12 mois en vertu d\u2019une entente d\u2019affectation, aux frais de l\u2019ACDI, convenue entre la CFP et l\u2019ACDI. L\u2019appelante compl\u00e8te sa formation \u00e0 la CFP et son affectation est reconduite, cette fois aux frais de la CFP, pour une autre p\u00e9riode de 12 mois.\n[18] Le 16 f\u00e9vrier 2009, au terme de cette deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode d\u2019affectation, l\u2019appelante r\u00e9int\u00e8gre son poste au sein de l\u2019ACDI au niveau PE-03. Elle demande alors d\u2019\u00eatre nomm\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste de niveau PE-04 en vertu du paragraphe 6 du protocole :\n6. Dans le cas o\u00f9 la plaignante ne r\u00e9ussi (sic) pas la formation dans les six premiers mois de son affectation \u00e0 la Commission de la fonction publique, la plaignante retourne au sein de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au poste de PE-3. L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019engage \u00e0 lui offrir une formation de 18 mois. Moyennant le r\u00e9sultat positif de l\u2019\u00e9valuation trimestrielle bas\u00e9 sur des objectifs clairs et pr\u00e9cis ainsi que des crit\u00e8res d\u2019\u00e9valuation, la plaignante sera nomm\u00e9e au niveau PE-4 via un processus non annonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode de formation de 18 mois.\n[19] Selon l\u2019appelante, l\u2019ACDI s\u2019engage, au paragraphe 6, \u00e0 lui fournir une formation de 18 mois et \u00e0 la nommer \u00e0 un poste PE-04 peu importe le moment de son retour \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI. L\u2019ACDI retient une interpr\u00e9tation fort diff\u00e9rente du paragraphe 6. Elle soutient qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019engage \u00e0 remplir les obligations qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es que si l\u2019appelante ne r\u00e9ussit pas sa formation \u00e0 la CFP et revient \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI dans les six premiers mois. Selon elle, puisque l\u2019appelante a compl\u00e9t\u00e9 sa formation \u00e0 la CFP, le \u00ab Plan B \u00bb formul\u00e9 au paragraphe 6 ne s\u2019applique pas.\n[20] Vu ce d\u00e9saccord quant \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du protocole, les parties tentent, en vertu du paragraphe 16 du protocole, de reprendre la m\u00e9diation par l\u2019entremise de la Commission afin de ren\u00e9gocier les points en litige. Le processus de m\u00e9diation est infructueux et l\u2019ACDI s\u2019en retire le 7 mars 2012.\n[21] Le 11 avril 2012, l\u2019appelante apprend que son poste est touch\u00e9 par un r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement des effectifs.\n[22] Le 28 mai 2012, l\u2019appelante d\u00e9pose, aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, la Plainte all\u00e9guant que l\u2019ACDI a contrevenu au protocole, l\u2019a soumise \u00e0 un traitement discriminatoire en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi et a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle en se soustrayant de ses obligations sous le protocole et en prenant d\u2019autres mesures d\u00e9favorables contre elle. Je reviendrai au traitement de la Plainte ci-dessous dans la section I. B. 3) de ces motifs.\n(2) Tentatives de l\u2019appelante de faire ex\u00e9cuter et interpr\u00e9ter le protocole [23] Le 29 mai 2012, apr\u00e8s que l\u2019ACDI se soit retir\u00e9e du processus de m\u00e9diation pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 16 du protocole et visant la ren\u00e9gociation des points en litige quant \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre du protocole, \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019appelante et conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 15 du protocole, le juge Pinard de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rend une ordonnance assimilant le protocole \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en vertu du paragraphe 48(3) de la Loi.\n[24] L\u2019appelante demande alors \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019\u00e9mettre une ordonnance de justification \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la pr\u00e9sidente de l\u2019ACDI, plaidant qu\u2019en refusant de la nommer \u00e0 un poste PE-04, elle a viol\u00e9 le protocole, assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et a donc commis un outrage au tribunal. Le 2 novembre 2012, dans la d\u00e9cision Rameau c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 1286, [2012] A.C.F. no 1641 (Q.L.) (le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage), le juge Boivin (maintenant juge \u00e0 cette Cour) rejette la requ\u00eate. Vu l\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 du paragraphe 6 du protocole, qui n\u2019\u00e9nonce pas clairement la conduite des parties, il d\u00e9cide qu\u2019il ne peut y avoir une violation d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e du protocole et donc un outrage au tribunal. Il d\u00e9termine aussi que les faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties n\u2019\u00e9tablissent pas que le d\u00e9roulement des n\u00e9gociations entreprises en vertu du paragraphe 16 du protocole puisse \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 un outrage : Jugement sur l\u2019outrage au para. 20. L\u2019appelante ne porte pas le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage en appel.\n[25] Le 16 janvier 2013, l\u2019appelante demande au Tribunal de trancher une question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation portant sur l\u2019application du paragraphe 6 du protocole.\n[26] Le 26 ao\u00fbt 2014, le Tribunal refuse de se saisir du d\u00e9saccord portant sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019application du protocole : Mache-Rameau c. Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international, 2014 TCDP 26, [2014] D.C.D.P. no 26 (Q.L.) (Rameau TCDP). Il fait valoir que sa comp\u00e9tence est tributaire des plaintes dont il est saisi par la Commission. Puisqu\u2019il a ferm\u00e9 son dossier quant \u00e0 la plainte de 2003 \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019approbation du protocole par la Commission et avant qu\u2019il n\u2019instruise cette plainte, il ne peut accueillir la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelante de se saisir de ce dossier afin d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le protocole : Rameau TCDP aux para. 52\u201354.\n[27] Le Tribunal prend acte du fait que les parties conviennent, au paragraphe 15 du protocole, que le protocole soit assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et, au paragraphe 16, que toute modification au protocole n\u00e9goci\u00e9e par les parties afin de r\u00e9gler un d\u00e9saccord concernant sa mise en \u0153uvre ait aussi force ex\u00e9cutoire en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il d\u00e9cide que ces dispositions ont pour effet de lui retirer \u00ab de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive toute comp\u00e9tence [\u2026] au regard de ce protocole d\u2019entente, lequel a identifi\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comme \u00e9tant le nouveau forum l\u00e9gal applicable afin de r\u00e9gler toute m\u00e9sentente en ce qui a trait \u00e0 ce protocole d\u2019entente sign\u00e9 entre les parties \u00bb : Rameau TCDP au para. 58.\n[28] L\u2019appelante d\u00e9pose \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une demande en contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. Le 19 octobre 2015, dans la d\u00e9cision Rameau c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CF 1180, [2015] A.C.F. no 1212 (Q.L.) (le Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal), le juge Roy rejette sa demande. Il d\u00e9cide que \u00ab le Tribunal avait raison d\u2019affirmer qu\u2019il ne pouvait disposer de la question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que voulait lui soumettre la demanderesse \u00bb et que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal \u00e9tait donc \u00ab correcte \u00bb : Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal au para. 21.\n[29] Selon le juge Roy, la comp\u00e9tence conf\u00e9r\u00e9e au Tribunal est d\u2019instruire une plainte. Aucune instruction de la plainte de 2003 n\u2019avait eu lieu, puisqu\u2019elle avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un r\u00e8glement complet et d\u00e9finitif. Sans instruction de plainte, le Tribunal, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait ni partie au r\u00e8glement ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 par la Commission ni partie \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance d\u2019une Cour, \u00e9tait sans comp\u00e9tence.\n[30] Le juge Roy se dit aussi d\u2019avis, au paragraphe 38, \u00ab qu\u2019un poids certain doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9 au fait que l\u2019entente, le r\u00e8glement, soit devenue une ordonnance de cette Cour \u00bb. \u00c0 ce titre, le juge Roy observe que le Tribunal, en expliquant que le protocole lui retirait, en faveur de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, toute comp\u00e9tence au regard du protocole, constatait son absence de comp\u00e9tence d\u2019agir au sujet du protocole devenu ordonnance de la Cour : Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal aux para. 45\u201346.\n[31] L\u2019appelante ne porte pas le Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal en appel.\n(3) La Plainte [32] Dans la Plainte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission le 28 mai 2012, l\u2019appelante all\u00e8gue que l\u2019ACDI a contrevenu au protocole, qu\u2019elle est victime d\u2019un traitement discriminatoire en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi sur la base de sa race, de sa couleur et de son origine nationale ou ethnique et que l\u2019ACDI a fait preuve de discrimination en exer\u00e7ant des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle, y compris en se soustrayant \u00e0 ses obligations telles que stipul\u00e9es dans le protocole et en prenant d\u2019autres mesures d\u00e9favorables contre elle. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle affirme que l\u2019ACDI a contrevenu au protocole en ne la nommant pas au niveau PE-04 \u00e0 son retour d\u2019affectation \u00e0 la CFP en f\u00e9vrier 2009, que l\u2019ACDI refuse toujours de reconna\u00eetre ses comp\u00e9tences et qu\u2019elle est victime d\u2019un refus syst\u00e9matique de toute possibilit\u00e9 de promotion ou d\u2019avancement au-del\u00e0 du niveau PE-03 ainsi que de repr\u00e9sailles et de harc\u00e8lement.\n[33] D\u2019embl\u00e9e, l\u2019ACDI, la mise en cause dans la Plainte, demande \u00e0 la Commission de se prononcer sur la recevabilit\u00e9 de la Plainte en vertu de l\u2019article 41 de la Loi \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des proc\u00e9dures intent\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale afin de faire ex\u00e9cuter le protocole, d\u00e9sormais assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour.\n[34] Une enqu\u00eatrice de la Commission (la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice) examine si le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage prononc\u00e9 par le juge Boivin avait trait\u00e9 des questions des droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la Plainte, la rendant vexatoire au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)d) de la Loi. Dans un rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate du 21 mars 2013 (le Rapport sur la recevabilit\u00e9), elle conclut que la Plainte compte des all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans son Jugement sur l\u2019outrage et que la Plainte, n\u2019\u00e9tant pas vexatoire au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)d) de la Loi, n\u2019est pas irrecevable. En particulier, elle constate que la Plainte inclut des all\u00e9gations additionnelles, notamment, l\u2019all\u00e9gation que la suppression du poste de l\u2019appelante constitue une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles :\nBien que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a (sic) rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de la plaignante, les questions des droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la plainte n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour et il y a des all\u00e9gations dans la plainte qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour non plus. De plus, la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise dans le contexte d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure d\u2019outrage, ce qui soul\u00e8ve des consid\u00e9rations diff\u00e9rentes et un fardeau de preuve distinct d\u2019une plainte \u00e0 la Commission.\nL\u2019enqu\u00eatrice recommande donc que la Commission statue sur la Plainte.\n[35] Le 19 juin 2013, s\u2019appuyant sur le Rapport sur la recevabilit\u00e9 et les repr\u00e9sentations des parties, la Commission d\u00e9cide que la Plainte \u00ab contient des all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb et que par cons\u00e9quent, elle n\u2019est pas vexatoire au sens de l\u2019article 41 (la D\u00e9cision sur la recevabilit\u00e9). Elle charge donc une enqu\u00eatrice de la Plainte (la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice).\n[36] Dans un rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate du 27 mars 2014 (le Rapport), la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice recommande \u00e0 la Commission de rejeter la Plainte en vertu du sous-alin\u00e9a 44(3)b)(i) de la Loi au motif que, compte tenu des circonstances, l\u2019examen de la Plainte par le Tribunal n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9.\n[37] Dans le Rapport, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au Jugement sur l\u2019outrage et \u00e0 la conclusion du juge Boivin selon laquelle les faits n\u2019\u00e9tayaient pas la pr\u00e9tention que le d\u00e9roulement des n\u00e9gociations en vertu du paragraphe 16 du protocole puisse \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 un outrage. Elle conclut :\nDe ce fait, les all\u00e9gations concernant la contravention du protocole d\u2019entente ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par un autre processus et la Commission ne traitera pas de ces all\u00e9gations. Cependant, quant aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles et de discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, le 19 juin 2013, de statuer sur la plainte en vertu du paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne parce que la plainte contient des all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[Je souligne.]\n[38] Bien qu\u2019elle exclut de son enqu\u00eate un traitement des all\u00e9gations concernant le non-respect du protocole, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice examine trois all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans la Plainte :\na)que l\u2019appelante s\u2019est vue refuser toute possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir un emploi, une promotion, une affectation int\u00e9rimaire ou tout autre occasion emploi;\nb)qu\u2019elle a subi un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel n\u00e9gatif dans le cadre de son emploi lorsque l\u2019ACDI ne lui a pas offert de possibilit\u00e9 de formation en dotation;\nc)qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de l\u2019ACDI, qui l\u2019a maintenue \u00e0 un niveau PE-03 et a bloqu\u00e9 ses avancements de carri\u00e8re du fait qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la Commission et parce qu\u2019elle a exerc\u00e9 ses droits en disputant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du protocole. De ce fait, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gativement affect\u00e9e par le r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement des effectifs qui a touch\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s de niveau PE-03.\nElle conclut, pour les motifs suivants, qu\u2019aucune de ces all\u00e9gations n\u2019est appuy\u00e9e.\n[39] Quant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation, la preuve indique que l\u2019appelante ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux exigences requises ou n\u2019avait pas manifest\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les postes en question.\n[40] Quant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation, la preuve indique que l\u2019appelante n\u2019avait pas fait de demande de formation dans ses plans d\u2019apprentissage et que l\u2019ACDI n\u2019\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9e d\u2019offrir des formations qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas connexes aux fonctions de l\u2019employ\u00e9e.\n[41] Enfin, quant \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation, la preuve indique que l\u2019appelante et son autre coll\u00e8gue de niveau PE-03 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on dans le processus de s\u00e9lection aux fins de maintien au poste et de mise en disponibilit\u00e9 et n\u2019appuie pas l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[42] Le 16 juillet 2014, la Commission d\u00e9cide, \u00e0 la suite de son examen du Rapport et des observations transmises par l\u2019appelante et par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, de rejeter la Plainte au motif que, compte tenu des circonstances, l\u2019examen de la Plainte par le Tribunal n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9 (la D\u00e9cision).\nII. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sous appel [43] Le 15 ao\u00fbt 2014, l\u2019appelante demande le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la D\u00e9cision.\n[44] En premier lieu, elle soutient que la Commission, agissant conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la recommandation de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice, a commis une erreur de droit en refusant, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du Jugement sur l\u2019outrage du juge Boivin, de traiter de la question du non-respect du protocole.\n[45] Deuxi\u00e8mement, elle plaide que la Commission a rendu une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable en adoptant les motifs d\u2019un rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate r\u00e9sultant d\u2019une enqu\u00eate d\u00e9ficiente, illogique, incompl\u00e8te et \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des principes et valeurs de la Loi. Elle reproche \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019avoir refus\u00e9, sans explication, de consid\u00e9rer les circonstances de la plainte de 2003, y compris le non-respect du protocole, dans son \u00e9valuation de la Plainte. Elle soutient que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas enqu\u00eater sur une contravention all\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00e0 une entente approuv\u00e9e par la Commission mine l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de la Commission et le respect des droits de la personne au Canada. Elle pr\u00e9tend aussi que la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a err\u00e9 en omettant d\u2019\u00e9tudier l\u2019impact de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019ACDI, en contravention au protocole, de ne pas la nommer \u00e0 un poste PE-04 o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9e du r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement des effectifs men\u00e9 par son employeur.\n[46] Troisi\u00e8mement, elle soutient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de manquements \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Notamment, elle plaide que la Commission l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre ad\u00e9quatement aux erreurs commises par la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice en limitant ses observations \u00e0 la suite du Rapport \u00e0 un maximum de dix pages. De plus, elle pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019omission de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice de lui d\u00e9voiler qu\u2019elle ne traiterait pas des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole avant de transmettre le Rapport aux parties l\u2019a priv\u00e9e de l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser d\u2019autres documents et pi\u00e8ces justificatives pour appuyer et \u00e9clairer sa position.\nA. Norme de contr\u00f4le [47] Tout d\u2019abord, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale souscrit \u00e0 la position des parties que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas consid\u00e9rer les all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole donne lieu \u00e0 une question de droit qui doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte : Jugement au para. 47. Hormis cette question, elle examine le bien-fond\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission que l\u2019examen de la Plainte par le Tribunal n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9 en appliquant la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. Enfin, elle examine la question de manquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte.\nB. Refus de traiter de la question du non-respect du protocole [48] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale conclut que la Commission n\u2019a pas err\u00e9 en d\u00e9cidant, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la recommandation de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice, qu\u2019elle n\u2019examinerait pas les all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole dans le cadre de son traitement de la Plainte.\n[49] Comme l\u2019avait conclu le Rapport sur la recevabilit\u00e9, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale convient que le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage ne traite pas des questions des droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la Plainte : Jugement au para. 58. Le juge Boivin ne fait que constater l\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 du protocole et conclut que les faits ne lui permettent pas de d\u00e9duire que le d\u00e9roulement des n\u00e9gociations entre l\u2019appelante et l\u2019ACDI en vertu du protocole puisse \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 un outrage. La Cour observe que cela ne voulait pas dire pour autant que le Rapport sur la recevabilit\u00e9 recommandait \u00e0 la Commission de traiter toutes les all\u00e9gations de l\u2019appelante. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, la Cour estime d\u00e9terminant que :\n[\u2026 T]el que l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 le PGC, l\u2019assimilation du protocole d\u2019entente \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale limite la capacit\u00e9 de la Commission ou du Tribunal de statuer sur une all\u00e9gation de violation. Selon les paragraphes 15 et 16 du protocole d\u2019entente, les parties ont consenti \u00e0 ce que celui-ci soit assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de notre Cour, soit ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 de la sorte et que tout d\u00e9saccord concernant la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ses conditions fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019une m\u00e9diation permettant de ren\u00e9gocier les points en litige.\n[Jugement au para. 59.]\nC. Caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la D\u00e9cision [50] La Cour d\u00e9cide que le Rapport consid\u00e8re ad\u00e9quatement le contexte de la plainte de 2003 en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 une \u00ab plainte pr\u00e9alable \u00bb ou \u00e0 une \u00ab plainte ant\u00e9rieure \u00bb, en la mentionnant dans la chronologie des \u00e9v\u00e9nements reli\u00e9s \u00e0 la Plainte et en s\u2019en servant comme point de d\u00e9part de son analyse des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles avanc\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante. Puisque la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice n\u2019avait pas err\u00e9 en refusant de traiter des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole, la Cour rejette l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelante selon lequel l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice aurait d\u00fb aborder les cons\u00e9quences positives qui auraient pu r\u00e9sulter de sa nomination \u00e0 un poste PE-04 en vertu du paragraphe 6 du protocole.\nD. D\u00e9ni d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale [51] La Cour conclut qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de d\u00e9ni d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale dans le processus suivi par la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice et la Commission.\n[52] Se fondant sur Jean Pierre c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), 2015 CF 1423, [2015] A.C.F. no 1503 (Q.L.) au para. 51, et Donoghue c. Canada (Ministre de la D\u00e9fense nationale), 2010 CF 404, [2010] A.C.F. no 459 (Q.L.) au para. 28, elle d\u00e9cide que l\u2019exigence impos\u00e9e aux parties de soumettre des observations au sujet du Rapport ne d\u00e9passant pas dix pages est raisonnable et ne pose aucun probl\u00e8me v\u00e9ritable d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[53] La Cour d\u00e9cide que l\u2019omission de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice de d\u00e9voiler \u00e0 l\u2019appelante qu\u2019elle ne traiterait pas des all\u00e9gations concernant le non-respect du protocole ne constitue pas un manquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale puisque, en recevant le Rapport, l\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de la preuve consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice et a pu expliquer et pr\u00e9senter tous les arguments pertinents s\u2019y rapportant.\nIII. Les questions en litige et le r\u00f4le de la Cour dans cet appel [54] Ce pourvoi soul\u00e8ve trois questions. Premi\u00e8rement, y a-t-il eu un d\u00e9ni d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale dans le processus suivi par la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice et la Commission? Deuxi\u00e8mement, mis \u00e0 part sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est-elle d\u00e9raisonnable dans son traitement de la preuve plac\u00e9e devant elle? Troisi\u00e8mement, le refus de la Commission de traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole rend-il la D\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable?\n[55] Avant d\u2019examiner ces questions, il est n\u00e9cessaire de traiter du r\u00f4le de la Cour dans le pr\u00e9sent appel.\n[56] Notre Cour est tenue de d\u00e9cider si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a employ\u00e9 la norme de contr\u00f4le appropri\u00e9e et si elle l\u2019a appliqu\u00e9 correctement. De cette fa\u00e7on, en nous mettant \u00e0 la place de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, nous nous concentrons effectivement sur la d\u00e9cision administrative : Agraira c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2013 CSC 36, [2013] 2 R.C.S. 559 aux para. 45\u201347; Office r\u00e9gional de sant\u00e9 du Nord c. Horrocks, 2021 CSC 42, [2021] A.C.S. no 42 (Q.L.) aux para. 10\u201312.\n[57] En ce qui concerne les questions d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, la cour de r\u00e9vision doit trancher si la proc\u00e9dure suivie par le d\u00e9cideur administratif est \u00e9quitable eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des circonstances : Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique Limit\u00e9e c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CAF 69, [2019] 1 R.C.F. 121 au para. 54. En ce faisant, la cour de r\u00e9vision n\u2019applique aucune norme de contr\u00f4le : Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique au para. 54. La question fondamentale demeure celle de savoir si la partie vis\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision administrative connaissait la preuve \u00e0 r\u00e9futer et si elle a eu possibilit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te et \u00e9quitable d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre : Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique au para. 56; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Ennis, 2021 CAF 95, [2021] 4 R.C.F. 154 aux para. 44\u201345.\n[58] La norme d\u00e9f\u00e9rente de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable s\u2019applique au bien-fond\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer ou non au Tribunal une plainte relative aux droits de la personne, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte : Ennis au para. 46. Comme cette d\u00e9cision administrative n\u2019est pas susceptible d\u2019appel, cette norme s\u2019applique sauf dans des circonstances extraordinaires : Ennis au para. 46, citant Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, [2019] 4 R.C.S. 653. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les parties s\u2019entendent sur l\u2019application de la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable et n\u2019ont soulev\u00e9 aucune circonstance pouvant justifier une d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019application de cette norme.\n[59] Il s\u2019ensuit que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dont le jugement a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov, a err\u00e9 en appliquant la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission d\u2019exclure de l\u2019enqu\u00eate le traitement des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole au motif qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une question de droit : Jugement au para. 47. Pour les deux autres questions en litige, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a correctement identifi\u00e9 les normes de contr\u00f4le applicables.\n[60] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Tazehkand c. Banque du Canada, 2023 CAF 208, 2023 CarswellNat 5838 aux para. 28\u201340, notre Cour a r\u00e9cemment r\u00e9sum\u00e9 les principes juridiques qui encadrent le contr\u00f4le judiciaire des d\u00e9cisions de la Commission. Il en ressort les principes importants suivants :\na)La Commission n\u2019est pas un organisme d\u00e9cisionnel, une fonction remplie par le Tribunal. Son r\u00f4le est de \u00ab d\u00e9terminer si, aux termes des dispositions de la Loi et eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des faits, il est justifi\u00e9 de tenir une enqu\u00eate. L\u2019aspect principal de ce r\u00f4le est alors de v\u00e9rifier s\u2019il existe une preuve suffisante \u00bb : Cooper c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1996] 3 R.C.S. 854, 1996 CanLII 152 (C.S.C.) au para. 53; Tazehkand au para. 29.\nb)La Commission jouit d\u2019un vaste pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour d\u00e9cider, \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019examen d\u2019une plainte, qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate par le Tribunal est justifi\u00e9e compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 celle-ci. Les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives qui conf\u00e8rent cette discr\u00e9tion empruntent des termes non-limitatifs, et imposent ainsi des contraintes minimales \u00e0 la Commission dans l\u2019exercice de cette fonction : Tazehkand au para. 30; Halifax (Regional Municipality) c. Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Human Rights Commission), 2012 CSC 10, [2012] 1 R.C.S. 364 au para. 25; Ennis au para. 56.\nc)Dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate que m\u00e8ne la Commission afin de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il est justifi\u00e9 de constituer un Tribunal en vertu de l\u2019article 44 de la Loi, la Commission doit faire preuve de neutralit\u00e9 et de rigueur : Slattery c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1994] 2 C.F. 574, 1994 CanLII 3463 (C.F.) \u00e0 la p. 598, conf par 205 N.R. 383, 118 F.T.R. 318 (C.A.F.); Tazehkand au para. 33.\nd)Cependant, il faut faire preuve de retenue judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des organismes administratifs, dont la Commission, qui doivent \u00e9valuer la valeur probante de la preuve et d\u00e9cider de poursuivre ou non les enqu\u00eates : Slattery \u00e0 la p. 600; Tazehkand au para. 34.\ne)La cour de r\u00e9vision doit reconna\u00eetre que la Commission est ma\u00eetre de son processus et lui laisser beaucoup de latitude dans la fa\u00e7on dont elle m\u00e8ne ses enqu\u00eates : Tahmourpour c. Canada (Solliciteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 113, 332 N.R. 60 au para. 39; Tazehkand aux para. 35\u201336.\nf)En \u00e9valuant si la Commission fait preuve de rigueur dans son enqu\u00eate, il ne faut pas astreindre cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 une norme de perfection. Vu ses ressources limit\u00e9es et son volume de travail \u00e9lev\u00e9, la Commission doit chercher un \u00e9quilibre entre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des plaignants d\u2019avoir droit \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate la plus compl\u00e8te possible, et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour la Commission de r\u00e9pondre aux exigences de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 administrative: Slattery \u00e0 la p. 600; Tahmourpour au para. 39; Tazehkand aux para. 36\u201337.\ng)Les parties peuvent compenser les omissions moins graves dans le rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur en les portant \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la Commission dans leurs observations compl\u00e9mentaires. Les seules lacunes dont serait entach\u00e9 le rapport d\u2019un enqu\u00eateur qui n\u00e9cessiteront une intervention du tribunal sont celles qui sont \u00e0 ce point fondamentales qu\u2019il ne pourra y \u00eatre rem\u00e9di\u00e9 par les observations compl\u00e9mentaires pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les parties \u00e0 la Commission : Sketchley c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 404, [2006] 3 R.C.F. 392 au para. 38; Slattery aux pp. 600\u2013601; Tazehkand au para. 38.\nh)Lorsque la Commission ent\u00e9rine les recommandations d\u2019un enqu\u00eateur et motive sa d\u00e9cision de mani\u00e8re sommaire, la Cour de r\u00e9vision pr\u00e9sume que les motifs de la Commission sont ceux expos\u00e9s dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Les motifs de la Commission peuvent donc \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9s en se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate : Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de production du Qu\u00e9bec et de l\u2019Acadie c.

Canada (Conseil national de recherches), 2001 CFPI 687, 206 F.T.R. 207 au para. 70; Tazehkand au para. 40.\n[61] En gardant ces principes \u00e0 l\u2019esprit, je vais examiner chacune des trois questions en litige.\nIV. Analyse A. Y a-t-il eu un d\u00e9ni d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale? [62] L\u2019appelante soutient que dans sa D\u00e9cision sur la recevabilit\u00e9, la Commission a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019objection de l\u2019ACDI que la Plainte \u00e9tait vexatoire \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du Jugement sur l\u2019outrage du juge Boivin. Elle estime donc qu\u2019elle avait, compte tenu de la D\u00e9cision sur la recevabilit\u00e9, une attente l\u00e9gitime que la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice tiendrait compte de la contravention all\u00e9gu\u00e9e du protocole. En refusant de la consid\u00e9rer, la Commission se serait \u00ab contredite \u00bb, aurait \u00ab ressuscit\u00e9 \u00bb l\u2019objection de l\u2019ACDI dans le Rapport et aurait port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019attente l\u00e9gitime de l\u2019appelante.\n[63] L\u2019appelante soumet que si la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice lui avait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne tiendrait pas compte de la contravention all\u00e9gu\u00e9e du protocole, elle aurait d\u00e9pos\u00e9, dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, des documents additionnels pour appuyer et \u00e9tayer sa position, notamment la plainte de 2003, la recommandation de la Commission concernant la plainte de 2003 et les rapports d\u2019\u00e9valuation concernant la formation de l\u2019appelante \u00e0 la CFP en 2006\u20132007. C\u2019est dans ce contexte que l\u2019appelante maintient qu\u2019il est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale de limiter sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 un maximum de 10 pages.\n[64] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soumet que les exigences de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9es puisque l\u2019appelante connaissait la preuve \u00e0 r\u00e9futer et a eu une possibilit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te et \u00e9quitable d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre. L\u2019appelante a re\u00e7u le Rapport avant qu\u2019il ne soit envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission et a donc appris que l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice ne traitait pas des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole. Dans leurs repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites, les procureurs de l\u2019appelante ont contest\u00e9 cette conclusion de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice, expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi ces all\u00e9gations devraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es et joint une copie du protocole. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, la limite de 10 pages impos\u00e9es aux parties pour r\u00e9pondre au Rapport n\u2019enfreignait pas l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[65] \u00c0 mon avis, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas err\u00e9 en concluant que l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il y a eu un d\u00e9ni d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale dans le processus emprunt\u00e9 par la Commission pour en arriver \u00e0 la D\u00e9cision.\n[66] L\u2019appelante a re\u00e7u le Rapport avant que la Commission ne l\u2019examine et prenne sa d\u00e9cision. Elle a, de ce fait, pris connaissance de la preuve \u00e0 r\u00e9futer, y compris la d\u00e9cision de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice de ne pas traiter les all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole. Elle a eu la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019y r\u00e9pliquer et a d\u2019ailleurs soumis des repr\u00e9sentations en r\u00e9ponse au Rapport qui faisaient \u00e9tat de sa position sur la question.\n[67] L\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9, dans le dossier devant la Cour, une affirmation claire, nette et explicite qui aurait suscit\u00e9 chez elle une attente l\u00e9gitime concernant la tenue de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Plainte : Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Mavi, 2011 CSC 30, [2011] 2 R.C.S. 534 au para. 68. Comme l\u2019a constat\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au paragraphe 55 du Jugement, ni la D\u00e9cision sur la recevabilit\u00e9 ni le Rapport sur la recevabilit\u00e9 ont affirm\u00e9 que la Commission devait se prononcer sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du protocole. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, l\u2019appelante a eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter des repr\u00e9sentations en r\u00e9ponse au Rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Ses droits proc\u00e9duraux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9s.\n[68] L\u2019argument de l\u2019appelante selon laquelle elle aurait d\u00e9pos\u00e9, dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, des documents additionnels si la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice lui avait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne consid\u00e9rerait pas les all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole ne tient pas la route. Si, comme le pr\u00e9tend l\u2019appelante, certains documents \u00e9taient pertinents et indispensables pour comprendre et mettre en contexte les all\u00e9gations de discrimination expos\u00e9es dans la Plainte, rien ne l\u2019emp\u00eachait de les d\u00e9poser aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but - que l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice d\u00e9cide ou non de se pencher sur les all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole.\n[69] Enfin, comme cette Cour l\u2019a confirm\u00e9 dans Phipps c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Canadienne des Postes, 2016 CAF 117, 484 N.R. 7 au para. 8, confirmant 2015 CF 1080, [2015] A.C.F. no 1079 (Q.L.) au para. 40, l\u2019imposition aux parties par la Commission d\u2019une longueur maximale de 10 pages pour leurs repr\u00e9sentations en r\u00e9ponse au Rapport ne constitue pas en soi un d\u00e9ni d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale \u00e0 condition que cette restriction soit appliqu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re uniforme aux parties. L\u2019appelante ne m\u2019a pas convaincu que ce principe ne saurait trouver application en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nB. Mise \u00e0 part la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole, sa d\u00e9cision est-elle d\u00e9raisonnable dans son traitement de la preuve plac\u00e9e devant elle ? [70] L\u2019appelante soumet que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission manque de transparence et d\u2019intelligibilit\u00e9 dans son traitement des preuves relatives \u00e0 la plainte de 2003 en omettant sans raison toute r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus entre 2009 et 2012 et soutient que ces erreurs, qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, d\u00e9montrent le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable de la d\u00e9cision.\n[71] L\u2019appelante souligne notamment les erreurs suivantes :\na)Le Rapport ne consid\u00e8re pas les all\u00e9gations de la plainte de 2003 en tant que circonstances factuelles pertinentes \u00e0 la Plainte et ignore compl\u00e8tement les \u00e9v\u00e9nements entre f\u00e9vrier 2009 et janvier 2012 dont l\u2019\u00e9tude serait n\u00e9cessaire pour comprendre le lien all\u00e9gu\u00e9 entre ces deux plaintes.\nb)La deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice n\u2019a pas pris en compte les all\u00e9gations de la plainte de 2003 afin de bien comprendre le contexte de la Plainte. Ces plaintes sont intimement li\u00e9es dans les faits et les all\u00e9gations de la plainte de 2003 indiquent que l\u2019ACDI n\u2019a jamais cess\u00e9 de traiter l\u2019appelante de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en doutant de ses comp\u00e9tences et en lui refusant toute promotion alors qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait ses preuves.\nc)Plut\u00f4t que d\u2019examiner l\u2019impact diff\u00e9rentiel et discriminatoire sur l\u2019appelante, dans le cadre du r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement des effectifs, du refus de l\u2019ACDI de la nommer \u00e0 un poste PE-04 en contravention du protocole, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a examin\u00e9 si l\u2019appelante et ses coll\u00e8gues de niveau PE-03 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, une analyse illogique qui ne r\u00e9pond pas aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles soulev\u00e9es dans la Plainte.\n[72] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice n\u2019a pas ignor\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations et le contexte de la plainte de 2003 puisqu\u2019elle la mentionne dans la \u00ab Chronologie des \u00e9v\u00e9nements de cette plainte \u00bb au paragraphe 10 du Rapport et qu\u2019elle en fait le point de d\u00e9part de son analyse des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles aux paragraphes 58 \u00e0 61 du Rapport.\n[73] Le contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable s\u2019int\u00e9resse avant tout aux motifs de la d\u00e9cision : Vavilov au para. 84. Une cour de r\u00e9vision \u00ab doit d\u2019abord examiner les motifs donn\u00e9s avec \u201cune attention respectueuse\u201d, et chercher \u00e0 comprendre le fil du raisonnement suivi par le d\u00e9cideur pour en arriver \u00e0 sa conclusion \u00bb : Vavilov au para. 84. Une d\u00e9cision raisonnable est \u00e0 la fois fond\u00e9e sur un raisonnement intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rent et justifi\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des contraintes juridiques et factuelles qui ont une incidence sur la d\u00e9cision : Vavilov au para. 99. Il incombe donc \u00e0 l\u2019appelante de convaincre cette Cour que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission et le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur lequel elle se fonde sont entach\u00e9s d\u2019une lacune suffisamment capitale pour les rendre d\u00e9raisonnables : Vavilov au para. 100.\n[74] Dans le Rapport, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a trait\u00e9 de trois revendications importantes qu\u2019avan\u00e7ait l\u2019appelante dans la Plainte : que l\u2019ACDI aurait syst\u00e9matiquement refus\u00e9 de promouvoir l\u2019appelante, qu\u2019elle lui aurait refus\u00e9 des possibilit\u00e9s de formation et qu\u2019elle aurait pris, envers l\u2019appelante, des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles li\u00e9es au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte de 2003.\n[75] Je suis d\u2019avis que la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a suivi un raisonnement rationnel et logique dans son analyse de ces arguments et de la preuve qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et qu\u2019\u00e0 ce chapitre, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission n\u2019est pas d\u00e9raisonnable.\n(1) Dans son traitement de la preuve, le Rapport suit un raisonnement intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rent et se justifie au regard des contraintes juridiques et factuelles pertinentes [76] Dans la Plainte, l\u2019appelante affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un refus syst\u00e9matique de promotion, malgr\u00e9 ses expressions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat et ses d\u00e9p\u00f4ts de candidatures pour des concours. Elle affirme que son \u00e9limination \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection dans un processus de nomination PE-05 \u00e9tait discriminatoire, puisqu\u2019elle ex\u00e9cutait \u00e0 la CFP des t\u00e2ches d\u2019analyste au niveau PE-05 et avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une performance satisfaisante.\n[77] Dans le cadre de son enqu\u00eate sur les pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019appelante relatives \u00e0 l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir un emploi, une promotion, une affectation int\u00e9rimaire ou autre occasion d\u2019emploi, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice fait \u00e9tat de trois occasions d\u2019emplois qui se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en 2011 et les examine en profondeur.\n[78] Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019appelante a postul\u00e9 pour le poste de Conseiller principal en mati\u00e8re de politique de ressources humaines (PE-05). Cependant, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a conclu, apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9vis\u00e9 les qualifications essentielles pour ce poste, que l\u2019appelante ne rencontrait pas la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019\u00ab [e]xp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente et vaste de la prestation de conseils en mati\u00e8re de dotation ou de classification \u00e0 la haute direction \u00bb qui \u00e9tait une qualification essentielle \u00e0 ce poste.\n[79] Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019appelante a exprim\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour participer \u00e0 un projet sp\u00e9cial \u00e0 l\u2019interne au niveau PE-04 qui consistait \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper une strat\u00e9gie de recrutement. L\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a conclu que ce projet a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 quand l\u2019ACDI a d\u00fb se pr\u00e9parer pour un r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement des effectifs et que personne n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi pour participer au projet sp\u00e9cial.\n[80] Troisi\u00e8mement, bien que l\u2019appelante ait exprim\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat verbalement pour un poste int\u00e9rimaire au niveau PE-04, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a conclu qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu des informations suppl\u00e9mentaires sur les connaissances requises, l\u2019appelante a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux exigences et n\u2019a pas manifest\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le poste par \u00e9crit.\n[81] Je suis d\u2019avis que la conclusion de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice rejetant l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle l\u2019ACDI aurait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en refusant \u00e0 l\u2019appelante toute possibilit\u00e9 de promotion ou d\u2019affectation aux postes en question est fond\u00e9e sur un raisonnement intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rent qui est \u00e0 la fois rationnel et logique et tient compte de la preuve devant elle.\n[82] De m\u00eame, la conclusion de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice quant \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de l\u2019appelante qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de traitement diff\u00e9rentiel n\u00e9gatif dans le cadre de son emploi parce que, malgr\u00e9 ses demandes verbales, l\u2019ACDI ne lui a pas offert de possibilit\u00e9s de formation en dotation, est fond\u00e9e sur un raisonnement intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rent qui est \u00e0 la fois rationnel et logique et tient compte de la preuve devant elle.\n[83] L\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a not\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante a reconnu ne pas avoir fait de demande \u00e9crite pour de la formation en dotation dans ses plans d\u2019apprentissage et que les obligations de l\u2019employeur se limitaient \u00e0 offrir aux employ\u00e9s des formations connexes \u00e0 leurs fonctions. Ainsi, la preuve n\u2019appuyait pas l\u2019all\u00e9gation de l\u2019appelante qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel n\u00e9gatif. Devant cette Cour, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 en quoi cette d\u00e9termination de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable.\n[84] Enfin, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a conclu que l\u2019appelante n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le r\u00e9sultat du processus de s\u00e9lection aux fins de maintien en poste et de mise en disponibilit\u00e9 constituait une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles envers l\u2019appelante parce qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte de 2003. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que, bien que certains membres du comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation \u00e9taient au courant que la plaignante avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte, les examens administr\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appelante et \u00e0 une autre candidate ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus anonymes avant d\u2019\u00eatre corrig\u00e9s et, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019autre candidate, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas obtenu la note de passage pour toutes les qualifications essentielles. Cette conclusion de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice est aussi d\u00e9fendable compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve devant elle.\n[85] Dans ses repr\u00e9sentations \u00e0 la Commission sur le Rapport, l\u2019appelante soutient que l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a mal compris la Plainte en rattachant le r\u00e9sultat de ce processus \u00e0 ses all\u00e9gations sur les repr\u00e9sailles et que le Rapport est illogique et ne r\u00e9pond pas aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles soulev\u00e9es dans la Plainte.\n[86] Cependant, l\u2019appelante ne fait aucune mention dans la Plainte ou dans ses repr\u00e9sentations d\u2019actes pr\u00e9cis qui constitueraient des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte de 2003. En l\u2019absence d\u2019explications \u00e9tayant son all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles, il \u00e9tait loisible \u00e0 la Commission de conclure que l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles n\u2019\u00e9tait pas appuy\u00e9e.\n(2) L\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de lacunes fondamentales dans le traitement par la Commission et l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de la preuve devant elles [87] L\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019en ne prenant pas en compte les all\u00e9gations de la plainte de 2003 dans son analyse de la Plainte, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a agi de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable. Elle souligne que les all\u00e9gations qu\u2019elle a formul\u00e9es dans la plainte de 2003 portaient sur des comportements semblables \u00e0 celles qu\u2019elle a faites dans la Plainte.\n[88] Il appert du Rapport que l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice \u00e9tait bien au fait de ces pr\u00e9tentions. Aux paragraphes 2 et 6, apr\u00e8s sa description des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui entourent la plainte de 2003, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice \u00e9crit que l\u2019appelante \u00ab all\u00e8gue que le mis en cause continue de refuser d\u2019accueillir ses comp\u00e9tences [\u2026] et qu\u2019elle a maintenant supprim\u00e9 le poste de la plaignante, ce qui n\u2019aurait pas eu lieu si le mis en cause n\u2019avait pas refus\u00e9 d\u2019accepter ses comp\u00e9tences \u00bb [je souligne].\n[89] Comme l\u2019observait la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au paragraphe 61 du Jugement, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice dresse une chronologie des \u00e9v\u00e9nements de la Plainte et inclut au tout d\u00e9but de la chronologie la plainte de 2003.\n[90] Le Rapport, au paragraphe 44, refl\u00e8te fid\u00e8lement l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelante que \u00ab compte tenu des discussions concernant la plainte pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, le mis en cause n\u2019a pas offert des occasions \u00e0 la plaignante pour approfondir ses connaissances en dotation, au niveau op\u00e9rationnel \u00bb [je souligne]. L\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a not\u00e9 que d\u00e8s son retour \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI en 2009, l\u2019appelante a re\u00e7u des formations, bien qu\u2019elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en dotation, mais n\u2019a jamais fait de demande \u00e9crite dans ses plans d\u2019apprentissage pour les ann\u00e9es fiscales 2009\u20132010, 2010\u20132011 et 2011\u20132012.\n[91] De m\u00eame, au paragraphe 62 du Rapport, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice refl\u00e8te fid\u00e8lement l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelante en repla\u00e7ant son all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles dans le contexte des discussions entre l\u2019appelante et l\u2019ACDI concernant leur dispute au sujet de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du protocole.\n[92] Contrairement aux pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019appelante, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a bien saisi son argument que le comportement de l\u2019ACDI envers l\u2019appelante apr\u00e8s son retour en 2009 \u00e9tait une continuation du comportement qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la plainte de 2003.\n[93] D\u2019ailleurs, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 dans la discussion des arguments centr\u00e9s sur le d\u00e9ni all\u00e9gu\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, si l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que des comportements sp\u00e9cifiques de l\u2019ACDI qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la plainte de 2003 \u00e9taient d\u2019une importance cruciale pour comprendre la Plainte ou la mettre en contexte, rien ne l\u2019emp\u00eachait de fournir ce rapport et tout autre document pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice pour qu\u2019elle les examine avec \u00ab toute la documentation fournie par les parties en plus de la plainte, de la position du mis en cause et de la r\u00e9futation de la plaignante. \u00bb\nC. Le refus de traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole rend-t-elle la D\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable? [94] L\u2019appelante plaide que la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a commis une erreur en fait et en droit lorsqu\u2019elle a refus\u00e9 de traiter des all\u00e9gations dans la Plainte concernant la contravention du protocole. Rappelons qu\u2019ayant soulign\u00e9 la conclusion du juge Boivin, dans le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage, que les faits ne lui permettaient pas de d\u00e9duire que le d\u00e9roulement des n\u00e9gociations entre l\u2019appelante et l\u2019ACDI en vertu du protocole puisse \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 un outrage, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a conclu au paragraphe 8 de son Rapport que la Commission ne traiterait pas des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole puisqu\u2019elles \u00ab ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par un autre processus \u00bb.\n[95] Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019en ent\u00e9rinant la recommandation de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole, la Commission a agi de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable.\n[96] Pour qu\u2019une cour de r\u00e9vision la d\u00e9clare raisonnable, il ne suffit pas qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit justifiable; le d\u00e9cideur doit, au moyen de ses motifs, justifier sa d\u00e9cision aupr\u00e8s des personnes auxquelles elle s\u2019applique.\n[97] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2021 CAF 157, [2022] 1 R.C.F. 153, notre Cour s\u2019est longuement pench\u00e9e sur l\u2019obligation d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif, \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov, de fournir aux personnes auxquelles s\u2019applique sa d\u00e9cision une explication motiv\u00e9e et suffisante pour appuyer cette d\u00e9cision.\n[98] Une explication motiv\u00e9e comprend deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments. Premi\u00e8rement, elle doit \u00eatre ad\u00e9quate, en permettant \u00e0 une cour de r\u00e9vision de discerner une analyse coh\u00e9rente et raisonnable qu\u2019elle est en mesure de suivre et de comprendre. Le d\u00e9cideur administratif ne satisfait pas \u00e0 cette exigence lorsque son raisonnement comprend des lacunes fondamentales parce que les motifs ne font pas \u00e9tat d\u2019une analyse rationnelle, ou lorsqu\u2019il est impossible de comprendre son raisonnement sur un point central de sorte qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun v\u00e9ritable raisonnement : Alexion au para. 12, citant Vavilov aux para. 85\u201386, 102\u201304. Deuxi\u00e8mement, ce raisonnement doit \u00eatre rationnel et logique et d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de faille d\u00e9cisive dans la logique globale. Le raisonnement d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif ne satisfait pas \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re si ses motifs ne font pas \u00e9tat d\u2019une analyse rationnelle, poss\u00e8dent un fondement erron\u00e9, r\u00e9v\u00e8lent une analyse d\u00e9raisonnable ou irrationnelle ou comprennent des erreurs manifestes sur le plan rationnel, dont le recours du d\u00e9cideur \u00e0 un raisonnement tautologique, de faux dilemmes, des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations non fond\u00e9es ou une pr\u00e9misse absurde : Alexion au para. 12, citant Vavilov aux para. 96, 103\u201304.\n[99] Afin de m\u00e9riter l\u2019intervention d\u2019une cour de r\u00e9vision, une lacune ne peut \u00eatre superficielle ou accessoire par rapport au fond de la d\u00e9cision; elle doit \u00eatre manifeste et concerner un point central reposant, entre autres, sur les questions et pr\u00e9occupations centrales soulev\u00e9es par les parties : Alexion au para. 13, citant Vavilov aux para. 102\u201303, 127\u201328.\n[100] Comme la Cour supr\u00eame dans Vavilov, notre Cour met en garde les cours de r\u00e9vision contre la tentation d\u2019examiner les motifs des d\u00e9cideurs administratifs au regard d\u2019une norme de perfection et d\u2019assujettir ces d\u00e9cideurs aux \u00ab normes auxquelles sont astreints des logiciens \u00e9rudits \u00bb : Alexion au para. 23, citant Vavilov aux para. 91, 104. S\u2019attendre que les d\u00e9cideurs administratifs livrent une justice administrative qui ressemble toujours \u00e0 la justice judiciaire risquerait de \u00ab judiciariser de fa\u00e7on excessive les processus administratifs, ce qui menacerait leur efficacit\u00e9 et risquerait de compromettre les motifs pr\u00e9cis pour lesquels le l\u00e9gislateur a confi\u00e9 cette comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l\u2019administration, \u00e0 l\u2019origine \u00bb : Alexion au para. 24.\n[101] La Cour supr\u00eame pr\u00e9vient que le fait qu\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif ne mentionne pas explicitement quelque chose dans ses motifs ne m\u00e8ne pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019ils sont insuffisants et que sa d\u00e9cision est d\u00e9raisonnable. Une cour de r\u00e9vision doit lire ses motifs de fa\u00e7on globale et contextuelle, eu \u00e9gard au dossier et en tenant d\u00fbment compte du r\u00e9gime administratif dans lequel ils sont donn\u00e9s : Alexion au para. 15, citant Vavilov aux para. 97, 103. Donc, le silence dans les motifs explicites sur un point pr\u00e9cis ne constitue pas n\u00e9cessairement une \u00ab lacune fondamentale \u00bb justifiant l\u2019intervention de la cour de r\u00e9vision :\nLes motifs du d\u00e9cideur administratif, lus s\u00e9par\u00e9ment ou au regard du dossier de fa\u00e7on globale et sensible, peuvent conduire l\u00e9gitimement la cour de r\u00e9vision \u00e0 conclure que le d\u00e9cideur administratif a tir\u00e9 une conclusion implicite. Le dossier de la preuve, les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, les points compris par le d\u00e9cideur administratif compte tenu des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents auxquels il renvoie ou qu\u2019il doit conna\u00eetre, la nature de la question que le d\u00e9cideur administratif doit trancher et les autres affaires connues du d\u00e9cideur administratif peuvent \u00e9galement alimenter le fondement permettant \u00e0 la cour de r\u00e9vision de conclure que le d\u00e9cideur administratif a tir\u00e9 des conclusions implicites.\n[Alexion au para. 16; citations omises.]\n[102] Je suis d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la recommandation de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice, de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole, repose sur des questions et pr\u00e9occupations centrales soulev\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante et concerne donc un point central de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission qu\u2019un examen par le Tribunal de la Plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9, compte tenu des circonstances.\n[103] D\u2019une part, dans la Plainte, l\u2019appelante d\u00e9crit la contravention all\u00e9gu\u00e9e du protocole par l\u2019ACDI comme la premi\u00e8re instance d\u2019une continuation, par son employeur, d\u2019un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel \u00e0 son endroit suite \u00e0 son retour \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI en 2009. Selon l\u2019appelante, n\u2019eut \u00e9t\u00e9 de la contravention du protocole, l\u2019ACDI l\u2019aurait nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de niveau PE-04, o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019abri de l\u2019\u00e9limination de son poste lors du r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement des effectifs.\n[104] D\u2019autre part, dans sa r\u00e9ponse au Rapport de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice, \u00e0 laquelle elle joint une copie du protocole, l\u2019appelante met au premier plan son argument que la recommandation de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de ne pas traiter de la contravention all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de l\u2019article 6 du protocole est en contradiction avec la D\u00e9cision sur la recevabilit\u00e9 et, de ce fait, entach\u00e9e d\u2019une erreur fondamentale. C\u2019est donc \u00e0 juste titre que la juge Saint-Louis, au paragraphe 50 du Jugement, affirme que cette recommandation est \u00ab au c\u0153ur \u00bb du litige entre les parties.\n[105] \u00c0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole comprend des lacunes fondamentales qui concernent ce point central. Le d\u00e9faut dont souffre cette d\u00e9cision n\u2019est pas qu\u2019il est impossible de comprendre le raisonnement de la Commission, qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun v\u00e9ritable raisonnement, ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas tir\u00e9 de conclusions explicites dans ses motifs; il ne rel\u00e8ve donc pas du caract\u00e8re ad\u00e9quat de l\u2019explication motiv\u00e9e. Son d\u00e9faut est plut\u00f4t que les motifs explicites de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice, qu\u2019ent\u00e9rine la Commission, reposent sur un fondement erron\u00e9, privant son raisonnement de la logique, la coh\u00e9rence et la rationalit\u00e9 qui caract\u00e9risent une d\u00e9cision raisonnable.\n[106] L\u2019examen du caract\u00e8re raisonnable d\u2019une d\u00e9cision administrative s\u2019int\u00e9resse avant tout aux motifs de la d\u00e9cision : Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes c. Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes, 2019 CSC 67, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 900 au para. 41. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, une analyse comparative de la D\u00e9cision sur la recevabilit\u00e9 et de la D\u00e9cision, ainsi que des rapports d\u2019enqu\u00eate qui les sous-tendent et qui en constituent les motifs, met en \u00e9vidence le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable de la D\u00e9cision.\n[107] La premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice, charg\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9paration du Rapport sur la recevabilit\u00e9, a examin\u00e9 si la Commission devait rejeter la Plainte au motif qu\u2019elle avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision dans le cadre d\u2019un autre processus et \u00e9tait donc vexatoire selon l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)d) de la Loi. Apr\u00e8s un survol de la jurisprudence pertinente, notamment la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame dans Colombie-Britannique (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) c. Figliola, 2011 CSC 52, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 422, et de notre Cour dans Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes c. Barrette, [2000] 4 CF 145, [2000] A.C.F. no 539 (Q.L.), elle a conclu que :\n[\u2026L]a Commission ne peut entendre une plainte ayant fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive dans le cadre d\u2019un autre processus que si (a) la plainte formul\u00e9e devant la Commission comporte des questions relatives aux droits de la personne qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es par l\u2019autre d\u00e9cideur, ou (b) le plaignant n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019occasion de soumettre ses questions relatives aux droits de la personne dans le cadre de l\u2019autre processus.\n[Je souligne.]\n[108] L\u2019ACDI a fait valoir \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice que la Commission ne devrait pas statuer sur la Plainte parce que les all\u00e9gations dont elle faisait part portaient essentiellement sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans sa requ\u00eate en outrage et invitaient la Commission \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter \u00e0 nouveau le paragraphe 6 du protocole.\n[109] La premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice n\u2019a pas accueilli cet argument et a conclu que la Plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vexatoire et de ce fait irrecevable. Il est utile de reproduire l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de son analyse :\n20. La question devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9tait \u00e0 savoir si la mise en cause avait commis un outrage \u00e0 la Cour en ne respectant pas son ordonnance donnant force au protocole d\u2019entente intervenu entre les parties en 2005. Or, la Cour a conclu qu\u2019il y avait (sic) \u00ab qu\u2019une diff\u00e9rence dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e et la conduite des parties n\u2019est donc pas clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 (sic) \u00bb (Mache Rameau c. Canada (Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 1286 au para 19). La Cour a aussi tenu compte des d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la Cour ne doit pas conclure \u00e0 un outrage quand l\u2019ordonnance en question est ambigu\u00eb, et la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\n21. Or, cette plainte inclut des all\u00e9gations additionnelles, notamment, l\u2019all\u00e9gation que la suppression de son poste constitue des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles.\n22. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019appel (sic) a confirm\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment que la Commission ne doit pas rejeter une plainte sous l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41 que dans les cas \u00e9vidents (voir Keith c Service correctionnel du Canada, 2012 CAF 117 au para 50). Ceci n\u2019est pas un cas \u00e9vident. Bien que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a (sic) rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de la plaignante, les questions des droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la plainte n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour et il y a des all\u00e9gations dans la plainte qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour non plus. De plus, la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise dans le contexte d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure d\u2019outrage, ce qui soul\u00e8ve des consid\u00e9rations diff\u00e9rentes et un fardeau de preuve distinct d\u2019une plainte \u00e0 la Commission.\nConclusion\n23. Cette plainte contient des all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte n\u2019est pas vexatoire au sens de l\u2019article 41.\n[Je souligne.]\n[110] Force est de constater que, selon la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice, la Plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vexatoire parce que les questions de droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la Plainte \u00ab n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour \u00bb et, selon la jurisprudence suivie par l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice, n\u2019avaient donc pas \u00ab \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es par l\u2019autre d\u00e9cideur \u00bb. Suivant cette recommandation, la Commission a conclu dans sa D\u00e9cision sur la recevabilit\u00e9 que la Plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vexatoire au sens de l\u2019article 41 parce qu\u2019elle contenait des \u00ab all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb.\n[111] Rappelons que dans la Plainte, l\u2019appelante all\u00e8gue que la pr\u00e9tendue contravention du protocole constitue la premi\u00e8re instance de traitement diff\u00e9rentiel envers elle de la part de son employeur apr\u00e8s son retour \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI en f\u00e9vrier 2009. Cette question est donc l\u2019une des \u00ab questions des droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la Plainte \u00bb qui, selon la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage. Comme le remarque cette enqu\u00eatrice, dans le contexte de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019outrage, la question devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale se limitait \u00e0 savoir si les obligations des parties \u00e9taient clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le protocole. Le juge Boivin n\u2019a pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 s\u2019il y a eu contravention du protocole ou si cette contravention \u00e9tait un acte discriminatoire. Il lui suffisait de d\u00e9cider que les dispositions du protocole \u00e9taient ambigu\u00ebs pour disposer de la requ\u00eate devant la Cour. Aux paragraphes 4 et 41 du Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal, d\u00e9cid\u00e9 deux ans plus tard, le juge Roy en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion.\n[112] Qu\u2019en est-il du Rapport de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice? Apr\u00e8s avoir constat\u00e9 que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les faits devant elle ne lui permettaient pas de d\u00e9duire que le d\u00e9roulement des n\u00e9gociations entre l\u2019appelante et l\u2019ACDI en vertu du paragraphe 16 du protocole puisse \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 un outrage, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice a conclu, au para. 8 :\nDe ce fait, les all\u00e9gations concernant la contravention du protocole d\u2019entente ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par un autre processus et la Commission ne traitera pas de ces all\u00e9gations. Cependant, quant aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles de discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, le 19 juin 2013, de statuer sur la plainte en vertu du paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne parce que la plainte contient des all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[Je souligne.]\n[113] Le fondement de la d\u00e9cision de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations concernant le non-respect du protocole, qu\u2019elles avaient \u00ab \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es \u00bb par le juge Boivin dans le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage, est erron\u00e9. Comme l\u2019a fait valoir la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice, la port\u00e9e du Jugement sur l\u2019outrage est limit\u00e9e. Afin d\u2019obtenir gain de cause dans sa requ\u00eate pour une ordonnance de justification, l\u2019appelante devait fournir \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une preuve prima facie de l\u2019outrage reproch\u00e9, y compris la preuve d\u2019une violation d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l\u2019ordonnance du juge Pinard qui homologuait le protocole. Une violation d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ne pouvait \u00eatre \u00e9tablie que si l\u2019ordonnance \u00e9nonce des obligations claires. Le juge Boivin a constat\u00e9 que le paragraphe 6 du protocole \u00e9tait ambigu, ce qui lui a suffi pour conclure que la requ\u00eate devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Il n\u2019a pas r\u00e9solu l\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 : Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal aux para. 4, 41.\n[114] Il s\u2019ensuit que la conclusion de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice que les all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole \u00ab avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par un autre processus \u00bb ne peut prendre sa source dans l\u2019analyse de la port\u00e9e du Jugement sur l\u2019outrage qu\u2019effectue l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice dans le Rapport.\n[115] Puisque la Commission a ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 les recommandations de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice et motiv\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision de mani\u00e8re sommaire, je dois pr\u00e9sumer que ses motifs sont ceux expos\u00e9s dans le Rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate et conclure qu\u2019ils souffrent de la m\u00eame lacune. La d\u00e9cision de la Commission d\u2019exclure de son traitement de la plainte les all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole ne saurait \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e par le fait que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait trait\u00e9 de ces all\u00e9gations dans son Jugement sur l\u2019outrage, vu la port\u00e9e limit\u00e9e de ce jugement.\n[116] La conclusion de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice dans le Rapport que le juge Boivin a trait\u00e9 de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de contravention du protocole est incompatible avec la conclusion de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice, dans le Rapport sur la recevabilit\u00e9, que les questions des droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la Plainte n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et que les consid\u00e9rations soulev\u00e9es devant la Cour dans la requ\u00eate en outrage \u00e9taient diff\u00e9rentes de celles soulev\u00e9es par la Plainte \u00e0 la Commission. Ni la Commission ni la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice n\u2019ont fourni une explication permettant de concilier ces d\u00e9cisions apparemment contradictoires. La d\u00e9cision de la Commission sur ce point est d\u00e9pourvue d\u2019une analyse intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rente et rationnelle.\n[117] Mes coll\u00e8gues estiment que, dans son rapport, la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice dresse une distinction entre les questions de droits de la personne relevant du non-respect du protocole, qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et ne devraient donc pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es par la Commission, et les autres questions de droits de la personne qui devraient faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate. Il n\u2019y aurait donc pas de contradiction entre les conclusions de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice et celles de la deuxi\u00e8me.\n[118] \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019analyse de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice ne se pr\u00eate pas \u00e0 cette interpr\u00e9tation. Dans la derni\u00e8re phrase du paragraphe 22 du Rapport sur la recevabilit\u00e9, \u00e0 la toute fin de son analyse et suivant sa conclusion que les questions de droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es par la Plainte n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour, la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice prend la peine d\u2019expliquer que le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage, qui portait sur les questions de non-respect du protocole, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans le contexte d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure soulevant des consid\u00e9rations diff\u00e9rentes et un fardeau de preuve distinct d\u2019une plainte \u00e0 la Commission. Cette explication n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire si l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que les questions de non-respect du protocole avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour et ne devaient pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es par la Commission; elle fait plut\u00f4t \u00e9tat de la conclusion de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019issue de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019outrage, la Commission demeure libre d\u2019examiner les questions de non-respect du protocole, en appliquant le fardeau de preuve appropri\u00e9, dans le contexte de son mandat l\u00e9gislatif visant \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les Canadiens contre la discrimination.\n[119] Au paragraphe 58 du Jugement, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a reconnu que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole ne trouvait aucun fondement dans le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage :\nLa Cour convient que le juge Boivin n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 des questions des droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es dans la Plainte. Il a soulev\u00e9 l\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 du protocole d\u2019entente, a conclu que la conduite des parties n\u2019y \u00e9tait pas clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9e, que le fardeau de preuve n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas satisfait et que la preuve prima facie n\u2019avait pas \u00e9tabli que le d\u00e9roulement des n\u00e9gociations entreprises entre Mme Mache-Rameau et l\u2019ACDI ou le comportement de sa pr\u00e9sidente, \u00e9taient assimilables \u00e0 un outrage au tribunal.\n[120] Comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait choisi de r\u00e9viser la d\u00e9cision de la Commission en appliquant la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte, elle a conclu que l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice n\u2019avait pas err\u00e9 en d\u00e9cidant de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole, mais pour un motif diff\u00e9rent de celui adopt\u00e9 par l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice dans son Rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Selon la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, l\u2019assimilation du protocole \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour limite la capacit\u00e9 de la Commission ou du Tribunal \u00e0 statuer sur une all\u00e9gation de contravention au protocole : Jugement au para. 59, cit\u00e9 ci-dessus au paragraphe 49.\n[121] Cependant, la norme de contr\u00f4le qui s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable. La Cour supr\u00eame est formelle : si les motifs fournis par la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice et ent\u00e9rin\u00e9s par la Commission pour justifier sa d\u00e9cision r\u00e9v\u00e8lent une analyse d\u00e9raisonnable, \u00ab il n\u2019est pas loisible \u00e0 la cour de r\u00e9vision de faire abstraction du fondement erron\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision et d\u2019y substituer sa propre justification du r\u00e9sultat \u00bb : Vavilov au para. 96. En ce faisant, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a err\u00e9 et sa d\u00e9cision ne saurait \u00eatre maintenue.\n[122] Mes coll\u00e8gues affirment qu\u2019\u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des dispositions du protocole, la Commission n\u2019avait d\u2019autre choix que de consid\u00e9rer le non-respect du protocole comme ne relevant plus du Tribunal et de la Commission et de ne pas traiter de cette question. Selon eux, l\u2019omission de la Commission \u00ab d\u2019expliciter davantage \u00bb son raisonnement sur cette question comme l\u2019ont fait par la suite le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne peut entacher la raisonnabilit\u00e9 de la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle elle est arriv\u00e9e. Mais le c\u0153ur du probl\u00e8me n\u2019est pas qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas suffisamment explicit\u00e9 son raisonnement \u00e0 propos de l\u2019impact du libell\u00e9 du protocole sur sa comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 statuer sur le non-respect du protocole. C\u2019est que ce raisonnement est enti\u00e8rement absent, puisque ce n\u2019est pas la justification qu\u2019a offerte la Commission au soutien de son refus de traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole. Comme l\u2019exige la jurisprudence expos\u00e9e ci-dessus au paragraphe 60, la Commission ayant ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 les recommandations de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice, nous devons pr\u00e9sumer que les motifs de la Commission sont ceux expos\u00e9s dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate : qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole parce qu\u2019elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es dans le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage. Lorsqu\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif offre des motifs explicites pour justifier sa d\u00e9cision, une cour de r\u00e9vision doit en \u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re raisonnable \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces motifs : Vavilov au para 84. Or, les motifs de la Commission, qui ne sont ni inexistants ni insuffisants, reposent sur un fondement erron\u00e9 et rendent sa d\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable. Proposer des motifs additionnels bas\u00e9s sur le libell\u00e9 du protocole a l\u2019effet de supplanter plut\u00f4t que de compl\u00e9ter l\u2019analyse de la Commission : Delta Air Lines Inc. c. Luk\u00e1cs, 2018 CSC 2, [2018] 1 R.C.S. 6 aux para. 23\u201324; Vavilov au para. 96.\n[123] Mais il y a plus. Une d\u00e9cision raisonnable doit \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e au regard de l\u2019ensemble du droit et des faits pertinents : Vavilov au para. 105. \u00c0 ce titre, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission \u00e9choue \u00e0 deux \u00e9gards.\n[124] Premi\u00e8rement, la Cour supr\u00eame fait valoir que \u00ab [l]es personnes vis\u00e9es par les d\u00e9cisions administratives sont en droit de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que les affaires semblables soient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tranch\u00e9es de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on et que les r\u00e9sultats ne d\u00e9pendent pas seulement de l\u2019identit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cideur \u00bb : Vavilov au para. 129. Cela est d\u2019autant plus vrai en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, o\u00f9 la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice, en d\u00e9cidant que l\u2019all\u00e9gation de contravention au protocole avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e par le juge Boivin, est parvenue, dans la m\u00eame affaire et sur la base des m\u00eames faits, \u00e0 une conclusion contraire \u00e0 celle de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice, et o\u00f9 la Commission a ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 ces deux conclusions apparemment contradictoires.\n[125] Dans les circonstances, je suis d\u2019avis que la Commission se devait d\u2019expliquer l\u2019\u00e9cart entre ces deux conclusions et son d\u00e9faut de le faire rend sa d\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable : Vavilov au para. 131.\n[126] Deuxi\u00e8mement, les principes de justification et de transparence qui sous-tendent le contr\u00f4le judiciaire selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable exigent que les motifs du d\u00e9cideur administratif tiennent valablement compte des questions et pr\u00e9occupations centrales soulev\u00e9es par les parties : Vavilov au para. 127.\n[127] Cette Cour ne peut pas s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que la Commission, lorsqu\u2019elle exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de rejeter une plainte dans le cadre de ses fonctions d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable, r\u00e9ponde \u00e0 tous les arguments ou modes possibles d\u2019analyse pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par la plaignante, au risque de paralyser son bon fonctionnement et de compromettre les valeurs importantes d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice : Vavilov au para. 128.\n[128] Cependant, comme le r\u00e9it\u00e9rait r\u00e9cemment la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2023 CSC 21, 485 D.L.R. (4e) 583 au para. 97, lorsqu\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif n\u00e9glige de tenir compte d\u2019un argument cl\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 par l\u2019une des parties, elle ne satisfait pas \u00ab \u00e0 la norme fix\u00e9e par l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov en ce qui concerne la justification adapt\u00e9e aux questions et pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es. \u00bb\n[129] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelante dans sa r\u00e9ponse au Rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice que la recommandation de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de ne pas traiter de la contravention all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de l\u2019article 6 du protocole \u00e9tait en contradiction avec la D\u00e9cision sur la recevabilit\u00e9 et, de ce fait, entach\u00e9e d\u2019une erreur fondamentale, \u00e9tait sans aucun doute un argument cl\u00e9. Bien que la Commission affirme avoir examin\u00e9 le Rapport et les observations des parties, elle a agi de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable en omettant totalement d\u2019aborder cet argument cl\u00e9 dans ses motifs.\nD. Le recours appropri\u00e9 [130] Lorsqu\u2019une d\u00e9cision contr\u00f4l\u00e9e selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable ne peut \u00eatre confirm\u00e9e, il conviendra le plus souvent de renvoyer l\u2019affaire au d\u00e9cideur pour qu\u2019il revoit la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des motifs donn\u00e9s par la Cour : Vavilov au para. 141.\n[131] Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce la Cour fait face \u00e0 l\u2019une des circonstances limit\u00e9es dans lesquelles elle devrait refuser de renvoyer la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la Commission. Comme l\u2019affirme la Cour supr\u00eame au paragraphe 142 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov :\n[\u2026 I]l y a des situations limit\u00e9es dans lesquelles le renvoi de l\u2019affaire pour nouvel examen fait \u00e9chec au souci de r\u00e9solution rapide et efficace d\u2019une mani\u00e8re telle qu\u2019aucune l\u00e9gislature n\u2019aurait pu souhaiter. L\u2019intention que le d\u00e9cideur administratif tranche l\u2019affaire en premi\u00e8re instance ne saurait donner lieu \u00e0 un va-et-vient interminable de contr\u00f4les judiciaires et de nouveaux examens. Le refus de renvoyer l\u2019affaire au d\u00e9cideur peut s\u2019av\u00e9rer indiqu\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il devient \u00e9vident aux yeux de la cour, lors de son contr\u00f4le judiciaire, qu\u2019un r\u00e9sultat donn\u00e9 est in\u00e9vitable, si bien que le renvoi de l\u2019affaire ne servirait \u00e0 rien. Les pr\u00e9occupations concernant les d\u00e9lais, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers les parties, le besoin urgent de r\u00e9gler le diff\u00e9rend, la nature du r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9glementation donn\u00e9, la possibilit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle ou non pour le d\u00e9cideur administratif de se pencher sur la question en litige, les co\u00fbts pour les parties et l\u2019utilisation efficace des ressources publiques peuvent aussi influer sur l\u2019exercice par la cour de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de renvoyer l\u2019affaire \u2014 tout comme ces facteurs peuvent influer sur l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de casser une d\u00e9cision lacunaire.\n[Citations omises.]\n[132] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, j\u2019ai conclu que le processus emprunt\u00e9 par la Commission n\u2019a pas priv\u00e9 l\u2019appelante d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et que l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de lacunes fondamentales dans le traitement par la Commission et la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice de la preuve devant elles qui rendraient la D\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable, mise \u00e0 part leur d\u00e9cision de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole. Notamment, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019en \u00e9valuant la Plainte, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice a omis de prendre compte des all\u00e9gations de la plainte de 2003. Seule la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, suivant la recommandation de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice, de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole est d\u00e9raisonnable. N\u00e9anmoins, je suis d\u2019avis que si cette Cour renvoyait l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la Commission pour qu\u2019elle revoie sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas traiter des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole, la seule d\u00e9cision raisonnable ouverte \u00e0 la Commission, compte tenu des contraintes juridiques et factuelles que constituent le Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal et le protocole lui-m\u00eame, serait d\u2019exclure de son enqu\u00eate le traitement des all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole et de rejeter la Plainte.\n[133] L\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a eu tort d\u2019extrapoler du Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal que la Commission n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence de statuer sur les all\u00e9gations de contravention au protocole contenues dans la Plainte. Selon elle, la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal diff\u00e8re de celle de la Commission. Si cette Cour renvoyait cette affaire devant la Commission, cette derni\u00e8re serait contrainte de reprendre son enqu\u00eate, en tenant compte, cette fois, des all\u00e9gations de discrimination relevant du non-respect du protocole, et exercer le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au paragraphe 44(3) de la Loi afin de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu de saisir le Tribunal de la Plainte. Si la Commission d\u00e9cidait de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer la Plainte au Tribunal, ce dernier instruirait la Plainte et, de ce fait, aurait la comp\u00e9tence de se prononcer sur les all\u00e9gations de discrimination, y compris celles relevant du non-respect du protocole.\n[134] L\u2019intim\u00e9 plaide que c\u2019est \u00e0 bon droit que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale affirme que l\u2019assimilation du protocole \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale limite la capacit\u00e9 de la Commission ou du Tribunal de statuer sur une all\u00e9gation de non-respect du protocole. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir qu\u2019il faut donner au paragraphe 48(3) de la Loi le sens que le l\u00e9gislateur voulait lui donner. Cette disposition pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019un r\u00e8glement d\u2019une plainte entre les parties qui est approuv\u00e9 par la Commission peut, par requ\u00eate d\u2019une partie, \u00ab \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance [de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale] et \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 comme telle \u00bb. Pour ex\u00e9cuter une ordonnance, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale doit l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter afin d\u2019en pr\u00e9ciser la port\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9vient que si cette Cour devait reconna\u00eetre que le Tribunal conserve la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9mise en vertu du paragraphe 48(3), il serait possible, par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une nouvelle plainte, de renvoyer ces questions d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation au Tribunal apr\u00e8s quoi l\u2019une des parties pourrait demander \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de sa propre ordonnance par le Tribunal est raisonnable. L\u2019intim\u00e9 plaide que la d\u00e9cision d\u2019une partie d\u2019assimiler une entente approuv\u00e9e par la Commission \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a pour cons\u00e9quence que les parties entrent dans le giron de la Cour quant \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019ordonnance.\n[135] L\u2019appelante r\u00e9plique qu\u2019en l\u2019absence d\u2019une disposition de la Loi retirant express\u00e9ment au Tribunal et \u00e0 la Commission la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter une ordonnance \u00e9mise par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en vertu du paragraphe 48(3), la Cour ne devrait pas donner suite \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui serait contraire aux objets de la Loi, notamment que toute plainte qui n\u2019est pas jug\u00e9e irrecevable fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate et d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Commission en vertu de l\u2019article 44 de la Loi.\n[136] Les parties s\u2019entendent qu\u2019aucune d\u00e9cision, \u00e0 part les jugements des juges Roy et St\u2011Louis de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, ne traite de la question de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal et de la Commission \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter les dispositions d\u2019une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui homologue un r\u00e8glement approuv\u00e9 par la Commission.\n[137] Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour cette Cour de se prononcer ex cathedra sur la question de savoir si, de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, un r\u00e8glement approuv\u00e9 par la Commission et subs\u00e9quemment assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en vertu du paragraphe 48(3) de la Loi, retire au Tribunal et \u00e0 la Commission la comp\u00e9tence de se prononcer sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions du r\u00e8glement. J\u2019estime qu\u2019il est possible de m\u2019en tenir aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[138] Dans sa d\u00e9cision dans Rameau TCDP, Le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 la demande de l\u2019appelante de le saisir de la question de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 6 du protocole pour deux motifs. Premi\u00e8rement, sa comp\u00e9tence en vertu de la Loi est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019instruction d\u2019une plainte. N\u2019\u00e9tant saisi d\u2019aucune plainte, le Tribunal ne pouvait pas se saisir du dossier de l\u2019appelante. Deuxi\u00e8mement, et ce qui est le plus important pour les fins qui nous int\u00e9ressent, le Tribunal a conclu, au paragraphe 58 de sa d\u00e9cision, qu\u2019il ne pouvait faire autrement que d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le paragraphe 16 du protocole comme \u00ab retirant de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive toute comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal au regard de ce protocole d\u2019entente, lequel a identifi\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comme \u00e9tant le nouveau forum l\u00e9gal applicable afin de r\u00e9gler toute m\u00e9sentente en ce qui a trait \u00e0 ce protocole d\u2019entente sign\u00e9 entre les parties \u00bb.\n[139] Au soutien de cette seconde conclusion, le Tribunal a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune disposition du protocole n\u2019avait \u00ab maintenu quelque juridiction que ce soit du Tribunal \u00bb dans le dossier de l\u2019appelante; que les parties avaient accept\u00e9, au paragraphe 15 du protocole, que ce dernier soit assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48(3) de la Loi; et qu\u2019elles s\u2019\u00e9taient aussi entendues, au paragraphe 16 du protocole, pour que toute modification \u00e0 ce dernier d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une reprise de la m\u00e9diation entre les parties \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un diff\u00e9rend concernant sa mise en \u0153uvre soit soumise \u00e0 l\u2019approbation de la Commission conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 48 de la Loi et ait force ex\u00e9cutoire en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale selon les m\u00eames modalit\u00e9s que le protocole initial : Rameau TCDP aux para. 55\u201357.\n[140] Au paragraphe 46 de son Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal rejetant la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de l\u2019appelante \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, le juge Roy a conclu que le Tribunal, par cette analyse des dispositions du protocole, constatait son absence de comp\u00e9tence. Qui plus est, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, aux paragraphes 21 et 28 de ses motifs, que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour se pencher sur la question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 6 du protocole \u00e9tait \u00e0 la fois raisonnable et correcte. \u00c0 la lecture du Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence, je ne peux retenir l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelante selon lequel le juge Roy n\u2019aurait ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 que le premier motif du Tribunal justifiant son absence de comp\u00e9tence d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le protocole, soit l\u2019absence d\u2019une plainte.\n[141] Puisque l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas interjet\u00e9 appel du Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence, celui-ci a un effet juridique d\u00e9finitif et ex\u00e9cutoire et toutes les questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es dans l\u2019instance, dont la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter le protocole conclu entre les parties en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, sont tranch\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive : Canada c.

Puisque le Jugement sur la comp\u00e9tence confirme que l\u2019effet du protocole conclu entre les parties en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est de retirer toute comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal au regard du protocole en faveur de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Commission ne pourrait exercer sa discr\u00e9tion en vertu de l\u2019article 44 de la Loi afin de confier au Tribunal l\u2019examen d\u2019all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9es uniquement sur une pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e contravention au protocole.\n[143] Je ne me prononcerai pas sur la question \u00e0 savoir si la Commission et le Tribunal peuvent, de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des mandats qui leurs sont confi\u00e9s par la Loi, interpr\u00e9ter les dispositions d\u2019autres r\u00e8glements intervenus entre d\u2019autres parties qui sont assimil\u00e9s \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale parce que j\u2019estime inutile de le faire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[144] J\u2019exercerais donc mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de r\u00e9paration de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas annuler la d\u00e9cision de la Commission et lui renvoyer l\u2019affaire pour nouvel examen : Maple Lodge Farms Ltd. c.

R\u00e8glement propos\u00e9 [145] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclurais que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est d\u00e9raisonnable, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de l\u2019annuler afin de renvoyer l\u2019affaire puisque la seule d\u00e9cision raisonnable \u00e0 laquelle la Commission pourrait parvenir en cas de nouvelle d\u00e9cision est que la Plainte de l\u2019appelante doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Je suis donc d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\n[146] Les parties ayant chacune gain de cause en partie, je n\u2019adjugerais pas de d\u00e9pens, tant devant notre Cour que devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n\u00ab Gerald Heckman \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nLE JUGE EN CHEF DE MONTIGNY ET LA JUGE GOYETTE (motifs concordants)\n[147] Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec l\u2019analyse de notre coll\u00e8gue concernant le droit applicable. De m\u00eame, nous sommes d\u2019accord avec lui qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de d\u00e9ni d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est raisonnable dans son traitement de la preuve devant elle. Par contre, nous arrivons \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente de la sienne en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas traiter de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de non-respect du protocole. Pour les raisons qui suivent, nous consid\u00e9rons que ce refus ne rend pas la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable.\nI. Faits pertinents [148] Une d\u00e9cision raisonnable doit \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e au regard du droit, mais aussi de l\u2019ensemble des faits pertinents : Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65 au para. 105 [Vavilov]. Les faits pertinents \u00e0 la question de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de non-respect du protocole se r\u00e9sument comme suit.\n[149] Dans sa plainte, l\u2019appelante all\u00e8gue le non-respect du protocole. Elle all\u00e8gue aussi des actes discriminatoires qu\u2019elle distingue du non-respect du protocole. Cette phrase de l\u2019appelante illustre cette distinction : \u00ab Par ailleurs, et mis \u00e0 part la contravention du protocole et l\u2019\u00e9chec de la m\u00e9diation, des \u00e9v\u00e9nements, tels la d\u00e9valorisation de mes comp\u00e9tences et le refus syst\u00e9matique de promotion, se sont succ\u00e9d\u00e9s entre 2009 et 2012, le plus r\u00e9cent \u00e9tant la suppression de mon poste le 11 avril 2012 \u00bb : Formulaire de plainte en date du 28 mai 2012, Dossier d\u2019appel, p. 83.\n[150] La premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice a pour t\u00e2che de faire une recommandation sur la recevabilit\u00e9 de la plainte. Dans son rapport, elle \u00e9crit que la question qui se pose \u00e0 elle est celle de savoir si la Commission devrait refuser de statuer sur la plainte \u00ab parce que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es par le biais d\u2019une autre proc\u00e9dure \u00bb, soit la proc\u00e9dure qui a donn\u00e9 lieu au Jugement sur l\u2019outrage de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Rameau c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 1286). La premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice r\u00e9pond \u00e0 cette question par la n\u00e9gative. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait une analyse de la jurisprudence en la mati\u00e8re, elle recommande \u00e0 la Commission de statuer sur la plainte parce que \u00ab les questions de droit de la personne soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour [f\u00e9d\u00e9rale] et il y a des all\u00e9gations dans la plainte qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour non plus \u00bb. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice mentionne l\u2019all\u00e9gation de suppression du poste de l\u2019appelante.\n[151] Sur la base du rapport de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice et des repr\u00e9sentations des parties \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce rapport, la Commission d\u00e9cide de statuer sur la plainte. Dans sa d\u00e9cision du 19 juin 2013, elle offre pour seul motif au soutien de sa d\u00e9cision : \u00ab Cette plainte contient des all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb.\n[152] Dans son rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate, la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice \u00e9crit que les all\u00e9gations de non-respect du protocole ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par un autre processus\u2014celui de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\u2014et que la Commission n\u2019en traitera pas. Elle ajoute : \u00ab Cependant, quant aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles et de discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, le 19 juin 2013, de statuer sur la plainte (\u2026) parce que la plainte contient des all\u00e9gations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb. Le reste du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate examine les all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte autres que celle du non-respect du protocole. Ce faisant, le rapport explique de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9taill\u00e9e les fondements de la recommandation de la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice selon laquelle ces autres all\u00e9gations ne justifient pas un examen par le Tribunal.\nII. Analyse [153] Il ressort des paragraphes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents que la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice interpr\u00e8te le r\u00f4le qui lui est confi\u00e9 comme consistant \u00e0 \u00e9valuer les all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte autres que celle de non-respect du protocole. Cette interpr\u00e9tation s\u2019appuie non seulement sur le Jugement sur l\u2019outrage, mais \u00e9galement sur la d\u00e9cision de la Commission du 19 juin 2013, laquelle d\u00e9cision s\u2019appuie \u00e0 son tour sur le rapport de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice. Or, il nous semble tout \u00e0 fait raisonnable de lire le rapport de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice comme signifiant que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination qui doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es par la Commission et dont la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 sont les all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte autres que celle de non-respect du protocole, telle l\u2019all\u00e9gation de suppression du poste de l\u2019appelante. Ainsi, nous ne voyons pas de contradiction entre les conclusions de la premi\u00e8re enqu\u00eatrice et celles de la deuxi\u00e8me.\n[154] Pour la m\u00eame raison, nous sommes d\u2019opinion que la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice pr\u00e9sente une analyse intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rente et rationnelle au soutien de sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas traiter du non-respect du protocole. Tout simplement, elle fait \u00e9tat de sa compr\u00e9hension\u2014avec r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 l\u2019appui\u2014selon laquelle la question du non-respect du protocole a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e par un autre processus et la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019examiner les autres all\u00e9gations de discrimination de la plainte.\n[155] On peut argumenter que la t\u00e2che de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate en outrage au tribunal se limitait \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le non-respect du protocole constitue un outrage au tribunal et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une analyse exhaustive de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de non-respect du protocole. Il n\u2019en demeure pas moins qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9raisonnable pour la deuxi\u00e8me enqu\u00eatrice et pour la Commission de consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019elles n\u2019avaient pas \u00e0 traiter de la question de non-respect du protocole.\n[156] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il importe de souligner qu\u2019en juillet 2014, lorsqu\u2019elle rend sa d\u00e9cision selon laquelle l\u2019examen de la plainte par le Tribunal des droits de la personne (Tribunal) n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9, la Commission agit apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u de l\u2019appelante une copie du protocole. Le paragraphe 15 du protocole assimile l\u2019entente des parties \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. De plus, le paragraphe 16 pr\u00e9voit que toute modification au protocole n\u00e9goci\u00e9e par les parties afin de r\u00e9gler un d\u00e9saccord concernant sa mise en \u0153uvre aura aussi force ex\u00e9cutoire en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Devant un tel langage, la Commission n\u2019avait d\u2019autre choix que de consid\u00e9rer le non-respect du protocole comme ne relevant plus du Tribunal (ni de la Commission) et par cons\u00e9quent, de ne pas traiter de cette question. Bien qu\u2019il lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 loisible d\u2019expliciter davantage son raisonnement sur cette question, comme l\u2019ont fait subs\u00e9quemment le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Mache-Rameau c. Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international, 2014 TCDP 26 aux para. 55\u201358; Rameau c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CF 1180 aux para. 32\u201334, 38, 40), cette omission n\u2019est clairement pas suffisante pour entacher la raisonnabilit\u00e9 de la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en sont arriv\u00e9es la seconde enqu\u00eatrice et la Commission.\n[157] D\u2019une part, les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal et de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale confirment si besoin \u00e9tait l\u2019absence de toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e des paragraphes 15 et 16 du Protocole et l\u2019absence de juridiction du Tribunal. D\u2019autre part, l\u2019on ne saurait s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un organisme administratif comme la Commission, dont la fonction n\u2019est pas de trancher des litiges mais plut\u00f4t de d\u00e9terminer si une plainte m\u00e9rite d\u2019\u00eatre trait\u00e9e au fond, fournisse des motifs d\u00e9taill\u00e9s et approfondis comme ceux auxquels on est en droit de s\u2019attendre d\u2019un tribunal quasi-judiciaire ou d\u2019une Cour. Tel que l\u2019affirmait cette Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Tazehkand c. Banque du Canada, 2023 CAF 208, aux para. 28\u201340, cit\u00e9 par notre coll\u00e8gue, il faut tenir compte des ressources limit\u00e9es et du volume de travail \u00e9lev\u00e9 de la Commission. Au risque de paralyser compl\u00e8tement le travail et la mission d\u2019un tel organisme, il faut rechercher un \u00e9quilibre entre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des plaignants d\u2019avoir une enqu\u00eate et des motifs les plus complets possibles et les exigences de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 administrative. Dans ce contexte bien particulier, nous estimons que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e au regard des faits et du droit.\n[158] Comme le dit notre coll\u00e8gue au paragraphe 101 de ses motifs, une cour de r\u00e9vision doit lire les motifs d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif de fa\u00e7on globale et contextuelle, eu \u00e9gard au dossier et en tenant d\u00fbment compte du r\u00e9gime administratif dans lequel ils sont donn\u00e9s: Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. c.

Elle doit aussi s\u2019assurer que le d\u00e9cideur administratif donne suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments pour assurer que les pr\u00e9occupations sur un point central ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en consid\u00e9ration : Alexion, aux para. 13, 19\u201320. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019all\u00e9gation de non-respect du protocole \u00e9tait une des pr\u00e9occupations centrales de la plainte. Nous sommes d\u2019avis qu\u2019un examen du dossier d\u00e9montre que cette pr\u00e9occupation a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Commission. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019examen d\u00e9montre qu\u2019\u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la jurisprudence en la mati\u00e8re, du Jugement sur l\u2019outrage et du texte du protocole, la Commission a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne lui appartenait pas de se prononcer sur la question de non-respect du protocole. Les rapports des enqu\u00eatrices font \u00e9tat du fondement derri\u00e8re cette d\u00e9cision. Ces rapports ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appelante.\nIII. Conclusion [159] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, nous sommes donc d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 et que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission devrait \u00eatre maintenue, le tout avec d\u00e9pens en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n\u00ab Yves de Montigny \u00bb\nj.c.\n\u00ab Nathalie Goyette \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\nA-48-17\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nMARIE MACHE RAMEAU c.

(Micsau) d\u00e9tenait, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de ses actions de 3295940 Canada Inc. (3295 ou l\u2019appelante), une participation minoritaire indirecte dans une entreprise de m\u00e9dicaments g\u00e9n\u00e9riques. Le propri\u00e9taire majoritaire a entam\u00e9 des n\u00e9gociations en vue de vendre l\u2019entreprise \u00e0 un tiers. De ce fait, Micsau devait vendre sa participation dans l\u2019entreprise.\n[2] Micsau souhaitait utiliser le co\u00fbt fiscal \u00e9lev\u00e9 de ses actions de 3295. Comme le co\u00fbt fiscal des actions que 3295 d\u00e9tenait dans l\u2019entreprise sous-jacente \u00e9tait beaucoup plus faible, une disposition de ces actions aurait g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 un gain en capital nettement sup\u00e9rieur. Micsau souhaitait donc vendre ses actions de 3295 et tirer profit de leur co\u00fbt \u00e9lev\u00e9. Pour les raisons que j\u2019expose plus loin, cela n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible. Dans ce contexte, Micsau a entrepris une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations calquant les cons\u00e9quences fiscales qu\u2019aurait engendr\u00e9es la vente par Micsau de ses actions de 3295.\n[3] Pour citer librement un auteur, ce qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre une [traduction] \u00ab occasion de planification fiscale tout \u00e0 fait ordinaire \u00bb, soit le fait pour Micsau d\u2019utiliser son co\u00fbt fiscal \u00e9lev\u00e9 et d\u2019\u00eatre impos\u00e9e sur son v\u00e9ritable gain \u00e9conomique, s\u2019est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00eatre, de l\u2019avis de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, de l\u2019\u00e9vitement abusif de la part de 3295 : Eric Hamelin, \u00ab GAAR Applicable to the Circular Payment of Capital Dividends \u00bb (2023) 71:3 Rev. fiscale can. 859 \u00e0 la p. 868 [Hamelin].\n[4] Compte tenu de la nature v\u00e9ritable et du r\u00e9sultat global de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations, il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019abus de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C. (1985), ch. 1 (5e suppl.) (la Loi). Pour les motifs suivants, j\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel.\nI. Contexte factuel [5] Selon Shakespeare, \u00ab la bri\u00e8vet\u00e9 est l\u2019\u00e2me de l\u2019esprit \u00bb. M\u00eame si je souhaite mettre en \u0153uvre cette maxime, je me dois de relater les faits de mani\u00e8re approfondie. J\u2019omets toutefois quelques d\u00e9tails accessoires par souci de simplicit\u00e9. Les lecteurs qui le souhaitent peuvent consulter un compte rendu complet des faits dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint partiel des faits (l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint) qui est joint \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Sauf indication contraire, les faits sont tir\u00e9s de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint.\nA. Situation initiale [6] Avant la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations, la structure d\u2019entreprise \u00e9tait la suivante.\n[7] Comme l\u2019illustre l\u2019organigramme, Micsau d\u00e9tenait 3295 en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 exclusive, et 3295 d\u00e9tenait une participation minoritaire dans Holdings. RoundTable, un fonds d\u2019investissement am\u00e9ricain, d\u00e9tenait le reste des actions et contr\u00f4lait ainsi Holdings. Holdings \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (Sabex 2002) qui exploitait une entreprise de m\u00e9dicaments g\u00e9n\u00e9riques.\n[8] Comme l\u2019illustre \u00e9galement l\u2019organigramme, les actions de 3295 d\u00e9tenues par Micsau avaient un prix de base rajust\u00e9 (PBR) de 48,1 M$ et une juste valeur marchande (JVM) de 101,8 M$. Les actions de Holdings d\u00e9tenues par 3295 avaient un PBR de 4 M$ et une JVM de 88,5 M$. L\u2019\u00e9cart entre le PBR des actions de Holdings et celui des actions de 3295 est attribuable \u00e0 une op\u00e9ration survenue deux ans avant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, op\u00e9ration par laquelle Micsau a achet\u00e9 des actions de 3295 aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un autre actionnaire pour devenir l\u2019unique actionnaire de 3295. Micsau a pay\u00e9 47,46 M$ pour ces actions suppl\u00e9mentaires. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart entre la JVM des actions de Holdings et celle des actions de 3295, il est attribuable au fait que 3295 disposait de 13,3 M$ en liquidit\u00e9s.\nB. RoundTable n\u00e9gocie la vente de Holdings [9] En 2004, RoundTable a entam\u00e9 des n\u00e9gociations en vue de vendre la totalit\u00e9 des actions de Holdings \u00e0 un tiers, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (Novartis). Une fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la vente par Micsau de ses actions de 3295 \u00e0 Novartis. Cette fa\u00e7on de faire aurait g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 un gain en capital de 53,7 M$ (101,8 M$ - 48,1 M$). \u00c0 titre comparatif, la vente par 3295 de ses actions de Holdings aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 inefficace : le faible PBR de ces actions aurait g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 un gain en capital de 84,5 M$ (88,5 M$ - 4 M$). \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette information, le conseiller en affaires et en fiscalit\u00e9 de Micsau a propos\u00e9 \u00e0 RoundTable \u2014 d\u00e9tentrice du droit exclusif de n\u00e9gocier avec Novartis et de prendre les d\u00e9cisions concernant la vente \u00e0 Novartis \u2014 les op\u00e9rations alternatives suivantes :\na)Micsau vend ses actions de 3295 \u00e0 Novartis;\nb)3295 et Holdings fusionnent : Cette fusion cr\u00e9erait une nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (Fusion inc.). Le PBR des actions de Fusion inc. d\u00e9tenues par Micsau serait identique \u00e0 celui de ses actions de 3295. Micsau vendrait ses actions de Fusion inc.;\nc)Une r\u00e9organisation de type \u00ab tuck-under \u00bb est entreprise: Micsau transf\u00e9rerait, sur une base imposable, ses actions de 3295 \u00e0 Holdings en contrepartie d\u2019actions de Holdings, ce qui permettrait \u00e0 Micsau d\u2019utiliser son PBR \u00e9lev\u00e9 en calculant son gain en capital d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019op\u00e9ration. Micsau vendrait ensuite ses actions de Holdings \u00e0 Novartis. Holdings et 3295 seraient d\u00e9tenues en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 crois\u00e9e, laquelle propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pourrait \u00eatre \u00e9limin\u00e9e sans imp\u00f4t suppl\u00e9mentaire par voie de fusion;\nd)Micsau vend ses actions de 3295 \u00e0 RoundTable : RoundTable pourrait alors liquider 3295, le PBR des actions de 3295 serait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 aux actions de Holdings et RoundTable vendrait les actions de Holdings \u00e0 Novartis.\nChacune de ces options aurait permis \u00e0 Micsau d\u2019utiliser son PBR \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour r\u00e9aliser un gain de 53,7 M$ et \u00e0 Novartis d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir la totalit\u00e9 des actions de Holdings.\n(Transcription de l\u2019audience du 8 septembre 2020, dossier d\u2019appel, vol. 2, aux pp. 1032, 1034\u20131036, 1040\u20131043 [transcription du 8 septembre]; transcription de l\u2019audience du 9 septembre 2020, dossier d\u2019appel, vol. 2, aux pp. 1149\u20131150 [transcription du 9 septembre]; 3295940 Canada Inc. c. La Reine, 2022 CCI 68 au para. 152 [motifs de la CCI].)\n[10] Il semble que RoundTable, pour \u00e9viter de freiner l\u2019\u00e9lan de la vente, n\u2019a pas propos\u00e9 les trois premi\u00e8res op\u00e9rations \u00e0 Novartis. N\u00e9anmoins, RoundTable a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Novartis n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir les actions de 3295 de crainte que 3295 ait des passifs potentiels datant de l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle op\u00e9rait une entreprise. La derni\u00e8re op\u00e9ration pr\u00e9voyait l\u2019acquisition des actions de 3295 par RoundTable, et non par Novartis. N\u00e9anmoins, RoundTable a rejet\u00e9 cette proposition, au motif qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas se retrouver avec une filiale canadienne (3295) apr\u00e8s la vente de Holdings : transcription du 8 septembre, aux pp. 1032\u20131035, 1043\u20131044, 1067\u20131068; transcription du 9 septembre, aux pp. 1114\u20131115, 1153\u20131155.\n[11] Une fois que Novartis et RoundTable se sont mises d\u2019accord sur les conditions de vente de Holdings, le conseiller de Micsau a pu s\u2019entretenir avec Novartis. Tenant pour acquis que Novartis ne voulait pas acqu\u00e9rir, directement ou indirectement, les actions de 3295, le conseiller a propos\u00e9 de vendre les actions d\u2019une nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 : transcription du 8 septembre, \u00e0 la p. 1035; transcription du 9 septembre, aux pp. 1114\u20131115.\n[12] Novartis a accept\u00e9 la proposition en contrepartie d\u2019une baisse du prix d\u2019achat de 1,5 M$ : transcription du 9 septembre, aux pp. 1108\u20131109. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ne permettent pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir clairement si les chiffres ci-dessous tiennent compte de la r\u00e9duction de 1,5 M$. Ce point n\u2019est toutefois pas pertinent pour trancher la question dont la Cour est saisie.\n[13] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, les op\u00e9rations suivantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9es.\nC. S\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations (1) Micsau \u00e9met 31,5 millions d\u2019actions de cat\u00e9gorie D [14] Micsau a \u00e9chang\u00e9 ses actions de 3295 contre (1) des actions privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es de cat\u00e9gorie D ayant un PBR et une JVM de 31,5 M$ et (2) 100 actions ordinaires ayant un PBR de 16,6 M$ et une JVM de 70,3 M$. Cette op\u00e9ration a fait qu\u2019une partie du PBR \u00e9lev\u00e9 de Micsau a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e aux actions de cat\u00e9gorie D nouvellement \u00e9mises.\n(2) Micsau transf\u00e8re les actions de cat\u00e9gorie D \u00e0 4244 [15] Micsau a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 les actions de cat\u00e9gorie D de 3295, d\u2019une valeur de 31,5 M$, \u00e0 une filiale nouvellement constitu\u00e9e : 4244851 Canada Inc. (4244). En contrepartie, 4244 a \u00e9mis en faveur de Micsau des actions de cat\u00e9gorie D ayant un PBR et une JVM de 31,5 M$. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les actions de cat\u00e9gorie D de 3295 d\u00e9tenues par Micsau avaient un PBR \u00e9gal au prix auquel elle a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 ces actions \u00e0 4244, cette op\u00e9ration n\u2019a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 aucun gain en capital. L\u2019organigramme r\u00e9sultant des op\u00e9rations pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es, dont RoundTable est exclue par souci de simplicit\u00e9, \u00e9tait le suivant :\n[16] Je fais une pause pour souligner un point essentiel. La proposition accept\u00e9e par Novartis consistait en la vente d\u2019actions d\u2019une nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (4244), pour un montant de 88,5 M$. Comme nous le verrons plus loin, deux \u00ab lots \u00bb d\u2019actions de 4244 seront vendus \u00e0 Novartis. Le premier lot se compose des 31,5 millions d\u2019actions de cat\u00e9gorie D de 4244 d\u00e9tenues par Micsau.\n(3) 3295 vend ses actions de Holdings \u00e0 4244\n[17] 3295 a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 ses actions de Holdings, d\u2019une valeur de 88,5 M$, \u00e0 4244. Pour rendre l\u2019\u00e9change juste, 4244 a \u00e9mis des actions d\u2019une valeur de 88,5 M$, r\u00e9parties ainsi : (1) 57 millions d\u2019actions de cat\u00e9gorie D, d\u2019une valeur de 57 M$ et (2) 31,5 millions d\u2019actions ordinaires, d\u2019une valeur de 31,5 M$. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi, 3295 a choisi un produit de disposition de 57 M$, et non de 88,5 M$. Par cons\u00e9quent, 3295 a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 un gain en capital de 53 M$ (57 M$ - 4 M$). Ce gain correspond \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 celui que Micsau aurait r\u00e9alis\u00e9 si elle avait vendu ses actions de 3295 \u00e0 Novartis. En raison de ce choix, les actions de 4244 d\u00e9tenues par 3295 avaient un PBR de 57 M$, lequel est all\u00e9 aux 57 millions d\u2019actions de cat\u00e9gorie D. Ainsi, les 31,5 millions d\u2019actions ordinaires d\u00e9tenues par 3295 n\u2019avaient pas de PBR.\n[18] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi, la moiti\u00e9 du gain en capital de 3295 a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e et l\u2019autre moiti\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e au compte de dividendes en capital (CDC) de 3295. Le CDC correspond aux montants, y compris la partie non imposable des gains en capital, qu\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 peut distribuer en franchise d\u2019imp\u00f4t. Ainsi, le gain en capital de 3295 a ajout\u00e9 26,5 M$ au solde de son CDC, le portant \u00e0 32,28 M$.\n[19] Apr\u00e8s ces op\u00e9rations, l\u2019organigramme \u00e9tait le suivant :\n[20] Je m\u2019arr\u00eate ici pour noter que le deuxi\u00e8me \u00ab lot \u00bb d\u2019actions de 4244 qui sera vendu \u00e0 Novartis est constitu\u00e9 des 57 millions d\u2019actions de cat\u00e9gorie D acquises par 3295 lorsqu\u2019elle a vendu les actions de Holdings \u00e0 4244.\n(4) \u00c9limination de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 crois\u00e9e entre 3295 et 4244 [21] Comme Micsau avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que Novartis ne voulait pas d\u00e9tenir, directement ou indirectement, d\u2019actions de 3295, la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations ne pouvait pas comprendre l\u2019achat par Novartis d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (4244) d\u00e9tenue en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 crois\u00e9e avec 3295. Par cons\u00e9quent, 4244 et 3295 ont \u00e9limin\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 crois\u00e9e avant la vente \u00e0 Novartis.\n[22] Il importe de souligner que l\u2019\u00e9limination de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 crois\u00e9e n\u2019a pas modifi\u00e9 la valeur de l\u2019actif que Novartis voulait acheter. Ind\u00e9pendamment de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 crois\u00e9e, la valeur de l\u2019entreprise de m\u00e9dicaments sous-jacente \u00e9tait de 88,5 M$. Cette valeur correspondait \u00e0 celle des deux \u00ab lots \u00bb d\u2019actions : (1) 31,5 millions d\u2019actions de cat\u00e9gorie D de 4244 d\u00e9tenues par Micsau, d\u2019une valeur de 31,5 M$ et (2) 57 millions d\u2019actions de cat\u00e9gorie D de 4244 d\u00e9tenues par 3295, d\u2019une valeur de 57 M$.\n[23] La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 crois\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e au moyen d\u2019un rachat crois\u00e9. D\u2019abord, 3295 a rachet\u00e9 les actions de cat\u00e9gorie D de 4244, en contrepartie d\u2019un billet \u00e0 ordre de 31,5 M$. La Loi a r\u00e9put\u00e9 ce montant de 31,5 M$ \u00eatre un dividende que 4244 a re\u00e7u de 3295. Comme 3295 a choisi de traiter ce dividende comme un dividende en capital, ce dividende n\u2019\u00e9tait pas imposable et le solde du CDC de 4244 a augment\u00e9 de 31,5 M$ (tandis que le solde du CDC de 3295 a diminu\u00e9 d\u2019un montant \u00e9quivalent). Ensuite, 4244 a rachet\u00e9 les actions ordinaires de 3295, \u00e9galement en contrepartie d\u2019un billet \u00e0 ordre de 31,5 M$. De ce fait, 3295 a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9put\u00e9e avoir re\u00e7u un dividende de 31,5 M$ de la part de 4244. 4244 a choisi de traiter ce dividende comme un dividende en capital. Par cons\u00e9quent, le dividende n\u2019\u00e9tait pas imposable, le solde du CDC de 4244 a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 z\u00e9ro, tandis que le CDC de 3295 a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9tabli. Enfin, 3295 et 4244 ont op\u00e9r\u00e9 compensation entre les deux billets \u00e0 ordre. Apr\u00e8s ces op\u00e9rations, la structure \u00e9tait la suivante :\n(5) Micsau transf\u00e8re ses actions de 4244 \u00e0 3295\n[24] Micsau a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 3295 le premier lot d\u2019actions, soit 31,5 millions d\u2019actions de cat\u00e9gorie D de 4244. En contrepartie, 3295 a \u00e9mis 31,5 millions d\u2019actions de cat\u00e9gorie D en faveur de Micsau. Apr\u00e8s ces op\u00e9rations, la structure \u00e9tait la suivante :\n[25] Comme l\u2019illustre l\u2019organigramme, 3295 avait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de toutes les actions de cat\u00e9gorie D de 4244, lesquelles avaient une JVM et un PBR de 88,5 M$. Ces actions proviennent des deux lots mentionn\u00e9s plus haut. Le premier lot correspond aux 31,5 millions d\u2019actions de cat\u00e9gorie D obtenues par Micsau en utilisant son PBR \u00e9lev\u00e9 aux premi\u00e8res \u00e9tapes de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations d\u00e9crites aux paragraphes 14 et 15. Le deuxi\u00e8me lot, soit 57 millions d\u2019actions de cat\u00e9gorie D, se compose des actions sur lesquelles 3295 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement impos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape 3 de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations d\u00e9crite aux paragraphes 17 et 18.\n(6) 3295 vend les deux lots \u00e0 Novartis\n[26] 3295 a vendu toutes les actions de 4244 qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tenait \u00e0 Novartis pour un montant de 88,5 M$. Comme le prix de vente des actions et le PBR \u00e9taient \u00e9quivalents, 3295 n\u2019a pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9 de gain en capital additionnel sur cette vente.\n(7) 3295 verse 31,5 M$ en liquidit\u00e9s \u00e0 Micsau\n[27] Enfin, 3295 a rachet\u00e9, pour un montant de 31,5 M$, les actions de cat\u00e9gorie D qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9mises en faveur de Micsau \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape 5 de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations d\u00e9crite au paragraphe 24. 3295 a affect\u00e9 au rachat des actions les fonds qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7us de Novartis \u00e0 la vente. Cette op\u00e9ration n\u2019a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 aucun imp\u00f4t \u00e0 payer. La structure apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations s\u2019illustre de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\nD. Nouvelle cotisation de la ministre [28] La ministre du Revenu national (la ministre) a \u00e9tabli une nouvelle cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de 3295 fond\u00e9e sur la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale anti-\u00e9vitement (la RGA\u00c9) pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 245 de la Loi. La RGA\u00c9 s\u2019applique lorsqu\u2019une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations remplit trois conditions. Premi\u00e8rement, il doit exister un avantage fiscal d\u00e9coulant de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations. Deuxi\u00e8mement, il doit y avoir une op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement, en ce que la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e principalement dans le but d\u2019obtenir un avantage fiscal. Troisi\u00e8mement, l\u2019op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement doit \u00eatre abusive. Il y a abus lorsque le r\u00e9sultat de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations contrecarre l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit d\u2019une disposition de la Loi ou de la Loi dans son ensemble.\n[29] Par sa nouvelle cotisation, la ministre s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur la RGA\u00c9 pour ajouter un gain en capital de 31,5 M$ au revenu de 3295. Selon la ministre, Micsau et 3295 ont effectu\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9vitement qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un avantage fiscal, \u00e0 savoir une r\u00e9duction de 31,5 M$ du gain en capital que 3295 aurait r\u00e9alis\u00e9 si elle avait vendu directement les actions d\u00e9tenues dans Holdings \u00e0 Novartis. Toujours selon la ministre, la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations a permis \u00e0 3295 d\u2019abuser :\na)du r\u00e9gime d\u2019imposition des gains en capital de la Loi vis\u00e9 aux alin\u00e9as 3b), 39(1)a) et 40(1)a) et au paragraphe 38(1);\nb)du r\u00e9gime fiscal propre aux dividendes en capital pr\u00e9vu aux paragraphes 83(2) et 89(1) de la Loi; et\nc)du paragraphe 55(2).\n[30] Avant de r\u00e9viser l\u2019analyse de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, je vais r\u00e9sumer bri\u00e8vement ces dispositions et leur cadre d\u2019application.\nII. Aper\u00e7u des dispositions qui auraient fait l\u2019objet d\u2019abus A. R\u00e9gime des gains en capital [31] Les gains en capital correspondent au gain \u00e9conomique qu\u2019une contribuable r\u00e9alise lorsqu\u2019elle dispose d\u2019un bien en capital : alin\u00e9a 39(1)a). Le gain en capital est obtenu en soustrayant le prix de base rajust\u00e9 (PBR) du produit de la disposition (PD) : paragraphe 40(1). Par exemple, si une contribuable ach\u00e8te un bien en capital au prix de 100 $ et qu\u2019elle le vend pour 150 $, elle r\u00e9alise un gain en capital de 50 $, soit le PD de 150 $ moins le PBR de 100 $. Seule la moiti\u00e9 du gain en capital est imposable : alin\u00e9a 38a). Ainsi, dans notre exemple, le gain en capital imposable est de seulement 25 $, soit la moiti\u00e9 du gain en capital de 50 $.\nB. Dividendes en capital [32] L\u2019objectif du l\u00e9gislateur est d\u2019imposer la moiti\u00e9 des gains en capital, qu\u2019ils soient r\u00e9alis\u00e9s directement par un particulier ou indirectement par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Lorsqu\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e r\u00e9alise un gain en capital, la partie non imposable est ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 son compte de dividendes en capital (CDC). Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, le solde du CDC correspond aux montants, y compris la partie non imposable des gains en capital, qu\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 peut distribuer en franchise d\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 ses actionnaires sous forme de dividendes en capital. Sans le CDC, la partie non imposable du gain en capital serait assujettie \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Lorsque la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 verse un dividende en capital \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 actionnaire, le solde du CDC de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui verse le dividende diminue du montant du dividende, tandis que le solde du CDC de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 actionnaire augmente du m\u00eame montant. Ces r\u00e8gles sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux paragraphes 83(2) et 89(1).\nC. Paragraphe 55(2) [33] Le paragraphe 55(2) s\u2019applique dans le contexte du r\u00e9gime des dividendes intersoci\u00e9t\u00e9s. Un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de ce r\u00e9gime est le paragraphe 112(1), lequel pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 actionnaire qui re\u00e7oit un dividende imposable d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne peut le d\u00e9duire de son revenu. Il s\u2019ensuit que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 actionnaire re\u00e7oit le dividende en franchise d\u2019imp\u00f4t. Ce r\u00e9sultat se justifie par le fait que le dividende a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9lev\u00e9 sur le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice apr\u00e8s imp\u00f4t; l\u2019imposer de nouveau entre les mains de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire donnerait lieu \u00e0 une double imposition.\n[34] Le paragraphe 55(2) a un double objectif.\n[35] Premi\u00e8rement, il fait obstacle au \u00ab d\u00e9pouillement de gains en capital \u00bb. Il y a d\u00e9pouillement de gains en capital lorsqu\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit sa valeur en versant un dividende \u00e0 sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 actionnaire avant la vente de ses actions, convertissant ainsi un gain en capital en dividende intersoci\u00e9t\u00e9s libre d\u2019imp\u00f4t. Voici une illustration des effets du paragraphe 55(2). Supposons que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 A inc. d\u00e9tienne la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 B inc. en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 exclusive. B inc. poss\u00e8de un actif d\u2019une valeur de 100 $. B inc. verse un dividende de 99 $ \u00e0 A inc., qui le re\u00e7oit en franchise d\u2019imp\u00f4t. A inc. pourrait alors vendre ses actions de B inc. \u00e0 un tiers pour 1 $. De cette fa\u00e7on, A inc. ferait passer la valeur de la vente de 100 $ \u00e0 1 $ et convertirait un gain en capital imposable en un dividende intersoci\u00e9t\u00e9s libre d\u2019imp\u00f4t. Le paragraphe 55(2) fait obstacle \u00e0 une telle strat\u00e9gie, car il r\u00e9pute le dividende de 99 $ comme faisant partie du gain en capital r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par A inc. \u00e0 la vente de ses actions de B inc.\n[36] Deuxi\u00e8mement, le paragraphe 55(2) prot\u00e8ge le flux de dividendes exempt\u00e9s d\u2019imp\u00f4t attribuable aux revenus d\u00e9j\u00e0 impos\u00e9s de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui verse le dividende : Canada c. Kruco Inc, 2003 CAF 284 au para. 32 [Kruco]. Pour reprendre l\u2019exemple pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, si le revenu apr\u00e8s imp\u00f4t de B inc. s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 10 $, elle peut verser un dividende de 10 $ \u00e0 A inc. avant sa vente. Un tel dividende est permis par le paragraphe 55(2). L\u2019hypoth\u00e8se sous-jacente est qu\u2019un dividende sup\u00e9rieur aux b\u00e9n\u00e9fices apr\u00e8s imp\u00f4t, soit un dividende sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 10 $ dans notre exemple, correspond \u00e0 la hausse de valeur non impos\u00e9e de l\u2019actif: Kruco au para. 32; Ottawa Air Cargo Centre Ltd. c. La Reine, 2007 CCI 193 au para. 27, conf. par 2008 CAF 54.\n[37] En gardant ce contexte l\u00e9gislatif \u00e0 l\u2019esprit, je me penche sur la d\u00e9cision de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t.\nIII. D\u00e9cision de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t [38] La Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t devait d\u00e9terminer si la RGA\u00c9 s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations. 3295 a admis que les deux premi\u00e8res conditions d\u2019application de la RGA\u00c9 \u00e9taient remplies, soit l\u2019existence d\u2019un avantage fiscal et l\u2019op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement. La seule question restante \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer si la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations \u00e9tait abusive.\n[39] La Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a jug\u00e9 que la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations constituait un abus du paragraphe 55(2) et du r\u00e9gime fiscal propre aux dividendes en capital : motifs de la CCI, aux para. 118, 120, 129\u2013132, 144. La Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a conclu que l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit des paragraphes 55(2), 83(2) et 89(1) sont collectivement \u00ab d\u2019emp\u00eacher qu\u2019un contribuable puisse, au moyen de dividende libre d\u2019imp\u00f4t, \u00e9viter le gain en capital inh\u00e9rent aux actions d\u2019une corporation attribuable \u00e0 la plus-value non r\u00e9alis\u00e9e \u00bb : motifs de la CCI au para. 118. Selon la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, les dividendes que 3295 et 4244 ont re\u00e7us au moment du rachat crois\u00e9 de leurs actions \u00e9taient abusifs parce qu\u2019ils ont contourn\u00e9 l\u2019application du paragraphe 55(2) et entra\u00een\u00e9 une augmentation du PBR des actions de Holdings d\u00e9tenues par 3295, alors que les sous-alin\u00e9as 88(1)c)(ii) et (iii) ne permettaient pas une telle augmentation : motifs de la CCI aux para. 118, 120\u2013123, 136\u2013144.\n[40] 3295 a fait valoir que cette strat\u00e9gie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas abusive parce que les op\u00e9rations alternatives, d\u00e9crites au paragraphe 9 ci-dessus, auraient pu \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9es et donner lieu \u00e0 une imposition moindre. La Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a dit que ces op\u00e9rations alternatives n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des points de comparaison valables parce qu\u2019elles \u00ab concernent la vente des actions de [3295] \u00bb et qu\u2019\u00ab il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la vente des actions de Holdings \u00e9tait primordiale \u00bb : motifs de la CCI au para. 159.\n[41] La Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a donc rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel et confirm\u00e9 la nouvelle cotisation de la ministre.\nIV. Question en litige et norme de contr\u00f4le [42] La seule question en litige est de savoir si la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations est abusive.\n[43] La norme de contr\u00f4le pour les affaires concernant la RGA\u00c9 port\u00e9es en appel d\u00e9pend de l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re abusif qu\u2019une partie conteste. L\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re abusif se fait en deux \u00e9tapes. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape consiste \u00e0 cerner l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit des dispositions en cause. Comme cette premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape est une question de droit, les cours d\u2019appel doivent appliquer la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte : Deans Knight Income Corp. c. Canada, 2023 CSC 16 au para. 78 [Deans Knight]; Canada c. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 CSC 49 au para. 50; Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco Canada c. Canada, 2005 CSC 54 au para. 44 [Canada Trustco]; Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33 aux para. 8, 26\u201337 [Housen]. La deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les op\u00e9rations en cause sont abusives. Cette analyse \u00ab d\u00e9pend n\u00e9cessairement des faits \u00bb et est donc susceptible de r\u00e9vision seulement en cas d\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une erreur de droit isolable : Deans Knight au para. 121; Canada Trustco au para. 44; Canada c. Oxford Properties Group Inc., 2018 CAF 30 au para. 39 [Oxford Properties]; Housen au para. 10.\n[44] Lorsqu\u2019un juge de premi\u00e8re instance omet de consid\u00e9rer le r\u00e9sultat global d\u2019une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations, il commet une erreur de droit isolable. Par exemple, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Oxford Properties, notre Cour n\u2019a pas fait preuve de retenue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la partie de l\u2019analyse du juge de premi\u00e8re instance sur le caract\u00e8re abusif, laquelle partie d\u2019analyse ne tenait pas compte du r\u00e9sultat global de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations : Oxford Properties aux para. 107\u2013113. Dans la m\u00eame veine, l\u2019omission du juge de premi\u00e8re instance de tenir compte de la v\u00e9ritable nature d\u2019un plan constitue une erreur de droit : Canada c. Microbjo Properties Inc., 2023 CAF 157 [Microbjo]. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Microbjo, le juge No\u00ebl a donn\u00e9 l\u2019explication suivante :\nEn ne tenant pas compte de la v\u00e9ritable nature du plan, la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a commis une erreur de droit. En effet, comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame dans Canada (Directeur des enqu\u00eates et recherches) c. Southam Inc., [1997] 1 R.C.S. 748, 144 D.L.R. (4e) 1 (par. 39 et 41), un tribunal qui fait abstraction de la preuve que le droit l\u2019oblige \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration commet une erreur de droit.\n(Microbjo au para. 74)\nV. Analyse [45] La Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019a pas tenu compte de l\u2019ensemble de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations et de son r\u00e9sultat global. Cette erreur de droit a men\u00e9 la Cour \u00e0 errer dans son analyse du caract\u00e8re abusif et \u00e0 rejeter \u00e0 tort les op\u00e9rations alternatives, lesquelles auraient permis de confirmer que la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations ne constituait pas un abus du paragraphe 55(2) ou du r\u00e9gime propre aux dividendes en capital.\nA. La Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re abusif [46] Pour d\u00e9terminer si des op\u00e9rations faisant partie d\u2019une s\u00e9rie sont abusives, la Cour supr\u00eame et notre Cour ont prescrit que l\u2019on doit tenir compte de \u00ab l\u2019ensemble des op\u00e9rations \u00bb ou de son \u00ab effet global \u00bb ou \u00ab r\u00e9sultat global \u00bb : Lipson c. Canada, 2009 CSC 1 au para. 34; Copthorne Holdings Ltd. c. Canada, 2011 CSC 63 au para. 71 [Copthorne]; Canada c. Landrus, 2009 CAF 113 aux para. 66\u201367; Birchcliff Energy Ltd. c. Canada, 2019 CAF 151 aux para. 27\u201328 [Birchcliff]; Oxford Properties aux para. 106\u2013110, 118\u2013119.\n[47] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le r\u00e9sultat global de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations n\u2019a pas l\u00e9s\u00e9 la ministre. Avant la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations, un gain en capital de 53,7 M$ aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 si Micsau avait vendu ses actions de 3295 \u00e0 Novartis. Apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations, un gain en capital de 53 M$ a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 et impos\u00e9. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9e, l\u2019\u00e9cart entre le gain en capital impos\u00e9 (53 M$) et le prix d\u2019achat pay\u00e9 par Novartis (88,5 M$) n\u2019a pas \u00e9chapp\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Il s\u2019agit simplement de l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un PBR obtenu de fa\u00e7on l\u00e9gitime : 4 M$ pour 3295 et 31,5 M$ pour Micsau.\n[48] Au lieu de tenir compte de l\u2019ensemble de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations et de son r\u00e9sultat global, la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a restreint son analyse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la s\u00e9rie o\u00f9 l\u2019on pouvait supposer que 3295 avait, par le dividende en capital vers\u00e9 au moment du rachat crois\u00e9, r\u00e9duit le gain en capital qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 \u00e0 la disposition de ses actions ordinaires de 4244 juste avant le versement du dividende. Toutefois, si la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t avait examin\u00e9 toute la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations, la seule conclusion qu\u2019elle aurait pu tirer \u00e9tait que le dividende en capital vers\u00e9 au moment du rachat crois\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9duit le gain en capital de 3295 et, par cons\u00e9quent, qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu d\u2019abus du paragraphe 55(2).\n[49] Un bref sc\u00e9nario hypoth\u00e9tique d\u00e9montre que le rachat crois\u00e9 n\u2019a pas diminu\u00e9 le gain en capital de 3295. Techniquement, Novartis aurait pu acheter les actions de 4244 sans le rachat crois\u00e9 d\u00e9crit au paragraphe 23. Le contr\u00f4le de 4244 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Novartis, comme dans la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations contest\u00e9e, et le gain en capital de 3295 aurait tout de m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 de 53 M$ (PD de 57 M$ moins PBR de 4 M$). Quant \u00e0 Micsau, elle n\u2019aurait r\u00e9alis\u00e9 aucun gain sur la vente de ses 31,5 millions d\u2019actions de cat\u00e9gorie D de 4244, car le PBR de ces actions \u00e9tait \u00e9gal \u00e0 leur JVM. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019achat par Novartis, 4244 et 3295 auraient pu \u00e9liminer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 crois\u00e9e au moyen d\u2019un rachat crois\u00e9. Tout comme la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 crois\u00e9e n\u2019a pas augment\u00e9 la valeur de l\u2019entreprise pharmaceutique que Novartis voulait acheter, le rachat crois\u00e9 n\u2019a pas diminu\u00e9 la valeur des actions vendues \u00e0 Novartis.\n[50] La ministre soutient que le dividende en capital vers\u00e9 au moment du rachat crois\u00e9 a diminu\u00e9 le gain en capital de 3295 de 31,5 M$. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. La r\u00e9duction de 31,5 M$ contest\u00e9e par la ministre ne r\u00e9sulte pas du rachat crois\u00e9, mais de la vente du premier lot d\u2019actions. Micsau a obtenu la JVM et le PBR de ces actions en isolant en toute l\u00e9galit\u00e9 le PBR et la JVM de 31,5 M$ obtenus l\u00e9gitimement dans de nouvelles actions de cat\u00e9gorie D.\n[51] L\u2019explication techniquement plus pr\u00e9cise de la r\u00e9duction de 31,5 M$ contest\u00e9e par la ministre est la suivante. Rappelons que les actions de 4244 d\u2019une valeur de 88,5 $ achet\u00e9es par Novartis provenaient de deux lots : le premier lot \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de 31,5 millions d\u2019actions de cat\u00e9gorie D d\u00e9tenues par Micsau, et le second, de 57 millions d\u2019actions de cat\u00e9gorie D d\u00e9tenues par 3295. Le second lot, d\u2019une valeur de 57 M$, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment impos\u00e9; ce que la ministre admet. Le premier lot reste en litige. La JVM et le PBR de 31,5 M$ pour ce lot r\u00e9sultent des deux premi\u00e8res \u00e9tapes de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations, par lesquelles (1) Micsau a isol\u00e9 le PBR et la JVM de 31,5 M$ obtenus l\u00e9gitimement dans des actions de cat\u00e9gorie D, puis (2) elle a \u00e9chang\u00e9 ces actions contre des actions de cat\u00e9gorie D de 4244, lesquelles avaient \u00e9galement un PBR et une JVM de 31,5 M$. Juste avant la vente \u00e0 Novartis, Micsau a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 les actions de 4244 qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tenait \u00e0 3295, puis 3295 a vendu ce lot \u00e0 Novartis pour 31,5 M$. L\u2019utilisation par Micsau de son PBR \u00e9lev\u00e9 explique donc pourquoi le premier lot n\u2019a pas g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 de gain en capital; cela n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec le dividende en capital vers\u00e9 au moment du rachat crois\u00e9.\n[52] Pour dissiper tout doute sur l\u2019objectif et l\u2019effet de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations, il convient de rappeler qu\u2019au lieu de transf\u00e9rer ses actions de 4244 \u00e0 3295 pour que 3295 les vende \u00e0 Novartis, Micsau aurait pu vendre ses actions de 4244 directement \u00e0 Novartis pour 31,5 M$. Si Micsau avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 ainsi, elle aurait re\u00e7u ce montant de 31,5 M$ directement de Novartis, et le gain r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par 3295 aurait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 de 53 M$ : Hamelin \u00e0 la p. 874. Cette autre fa\u00e7on de faire aurait clairement \u00e9tabli que l\u2019objectif et l\u2019effet de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations \u00e9taient de permettre \u00e0 Micsau d\u2019utiliser son PBR \u00e9lev\u00e9, et non de r\u00e9duire abusivement le gain en capital de 3295. D\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019objectif et l\u2019effet correspondent exactement \u00e0 l\u2019information qui figure dans les documents de planification fiscale de l\u2019appelante : dossier d\u2019appel, vol. 1, onglet F.5, \u00e0 la p. 829.\n[53] Pour conclure, la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la vente d\u2019actions d\u2019une nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (4244), pour un montant de 88,5 M$. Au cours de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations, 3295 a re\u00e7u 57 M$ et a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e sur un gain en capital de 53 M$ (PD de 57 M$ moins PBR de 4 M$). \u00c9galement dans cette s\u00e9rie, Micsau a re\u00e7u 31,5 M$ tout en utilisant 31,5 M$ de son PBR. Avant la s\u00e9rie, les actions de 3295 d\u00e9tenues par Micsau affichaient un PBR de 48,1 M$ et une JVM de 101,8 M$, pour un gain accumul\u00e9 de 53,7 M$. Apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9rie, Micsau a re\u00e7u 31,5 M$ de la part de 3295, le PBR et la JVM des actions de 3295 d\u00e9tenues par Micsau ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duits de 31,5 M$, et le gain accumul\u00e9 par Micsau sur ces actions est toujours de 53,7 M$ (PBR de 16,6 M$ et JVM de 70,3 M$). Ainsi, Micsau sera impos\u00e9e sur un montant de 53,7 M$ si elle vend ses actions de 3295 apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations.\n[54] Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9valu\u00e9 le dividende en capital vers\u00e9 au moment du rachat crois\u00e9 qui est contest\u00e9 en le pla\u00e7ant dans le contexte de toute la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations, comme la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t aurait d\u00fb le faire, je ne vois pas en quoi cette op\u00e9ration \u00e9tait abusive. Je suis d\u2019accord avec 3295 pour dire que le r\u00e9sultat global de cette s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019objet et \u00e0 l\u2019esprit du r\u00e9gime des gains en capital pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9tabli par notre Cour, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019imposition de gains \u00e9conomiques v\u00e9ritables : Triad Gestco Ltd. c. Canada, 2012 CAF 258 aux para. 40\u201342.\nB. La Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a omis de tenir compte des op\u00e9rations alternatives [55] En omettant de tenir compte de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations dans son ensemble et de son r\u00e9sultat global, la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a non seulement mal effectu\u00e9 l\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re abusif, mais elle a aussi rejet\u00e9 \u00e0 tort les op\u00e9rations alternatives, lesquelles auraient permis de confirmer le caract\u00e8re non abusif de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations.\n[56] Les op\u00e9rations alternatives qu\u2019aurait pu r\u00e9aliser un contribuable sont prises en compte dans le cadre de l\u2019analyse de la RGA\u00c9.\n[57] Par exemple, dans certains cas, il se peut que l\u2019existence d\u2019un avantage fiscal ne puisse \u00eatre \u00e9tablie qu\u2019au moyen d\u2019une comparaison entre les attributs fiscaux de l\u2019op\u00e9ration ou de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations effectu\u00e9es et ceux d\u2019une autre op\u00e9ration qui aurait pu \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9e : Canada Trustco par. 20; Copthorne au para. 35. Le cas qui nous occupe en est un exemple parfait, 3295 ayant admis l\u2019existence d\u2019un avantage fiscal parce que, sans la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations, la vente de 1,5 million d\u2019actions de Holdings qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tenait aurait donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un gain en capital sup\u00e9rieur.\n[58] De m\u00eame, les tribunaux tiennent compte des attributs fiscaux des op\u00e9rations alternatives au moment d\u2019\u00e9tablir si l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal a un caract\u00e8re abusif : Shawn D. Porter, \u00ab The Misuse and Abuse Exception: The Role of Alternative Transactions \u00bb dans Brian J. Arnold, (\u00e9d.), The General Anti-Avoidance Rule: Past, Present, and Future (Toronto : Fondation canadienne de la fiscalit\u00e9, 2021) aux pp. 275\u2013286 [Porter], citant Lehigh Cement Limited c. Canada, 2010 CAF 124 aux para. 40\u201341; Birchcliff aux para. 31, 48; Mathew c. Canada, 2005 CSC 55 au para. 58. Les op\u00e9rations alternatives sont utiles pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019objet et l\u2019esprit des dispositions pertinentes et, de ce fait, ce qui est autoris\u00e9 et interdit par la Loi. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le juge Webb de notre Cour :\n\u00c0 mon avis, les autres op\u00e9rations possibles d\u00e9crites par le contribuable constituent un \u00e9l\u00e9ment pertinent pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a eu abus dans l\u2019application des dispositions de la LIR [la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu]. La capacit\u00e9 du contribuable de d\u00e9montrer [qu\u2019il aurait] pu accomplir le m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat sans assujettissement \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t en effectuant d\u2019autres op\u00e9rations constitue, \u00e0 mon avis, un \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui permet de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement \u00e9tait abusive.\n[...] [L]\u2019autre moyen d\u2019obtenir le m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important qui permet de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019op\u00e9ration d\u2019\u00e9vitement \u00e9tait abusive.\n(Univar Holdco Canada ULC c. Canada, 2017 CAF 207 aux para. 19\u201320 [Univar])\n[59] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, 3295 a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t d\u2019examiner les quatre op\u00e9rations alternatives non abusives, lesquelles op\u00e9ration auraient permis \u00e0 Micsau d\u2019utiliser le PBR \u00e9lev\u00e9 de ses actions de 3295. Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9, la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a jug\u00e9 que ces op\u00e9rations n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des points de comparaison valables parce qu\u2019elles \u00ab concernent la vente des actions de [3295] \u00bb et qu\u2019\u00ab il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la vente des actions de Holdings \u00e9tait primordiale \u00bb, avec pour cons\u00e9quence que \u00ab l\u2019objet de la vente, le prix et les cons\u00e9quences commerciales auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rents \u00bb : motifs de la CCI aux para. 159\u2013160.\n[60] La conclusion de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t selon laquelle la vente des actions de Holdings \u00e9tait primordiale n\u2019est pas compatible avec la preuve et constitue une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante : Novartis n\u2019a pas achet\u00e9 les actions de Holdings, mais celles de 4244. De plus, aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment au dossier n\u2019indique que la vente des actions de 4244 a eu une incidence sur l\u2019objet de la vente ou les cons\u00e9quences commerciales de l\u2019op\u00e9ration avec Novartis. En effet, Novartis a obtenu une r\u00e9duction de 1,5 M$ en acceptant d\u2019acheter des actions de 4244 plut\u00f4t que des actions de Holdings. Il est possible que les op\u00e9rations alternatives propos\u00e9es par 3295 auraient donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la m\u00eame r\u00e9duction du prix, mais elles n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 Novartis.\n[61] Plus fondamentalement, en d\u00e9cidant de ne pas tenir compte des op\u00e9rations alternatives, la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a omis de prendre en consid\u00e9ration le r\u00e9sultat global de la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations : Micsau a utilis\u00e9 son PBR \u00e9lev\u00e9 et r\u00e9alis\u00e9 un gain en capital correspondant \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s au gain en capital qu\u2019elle aurait r\u00e9alis\u00e9 en vendant 3295 directement. \u00c0 mon avis, les op\u00e9rations alternatives pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par 3295 sont pertinentes pour les raisons suivantes :\na)Elles sont autoris\u00e9es par la Loi. Le fait qu\u2019elles n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 Novartis ou que Novartis aurait pu refuser d\u2019y donner suite n\u2019emp\u00eache pas qu\u2019elles fussent autoris\u00e9es par la Loi;\nb)Elles ne sont pas improbables au point d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s irr\u00e9alisables. Les op\u00e9rations alternatives pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par 3295 auraient r\u00e9ellement pu \u00eatre effectu\u00e9es. Si Novartis ou RoundTable avaient accept\u00e9, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 assez facile de les r\u00e9aliser;\nc)Elles pr\u00e9sentent un fort degr\u00e9 de ressemblances sur le plan commercial et \u00e9conomique avec la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations en cause : Porter \u00e0 la p. 270. Les op\u00e9rations alternatives auraient men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition par Novartis d\u2019actions d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dont l\u2019actif sous-jacent \u00e9tait l\u2019entreprise de m\u00e9dicaments g\u00e9n\u00e9riques, soit exactement l\u2019acquisition r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par Novartis;\nd)Elles ont des incidences fiscales \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s aussi favorables que la s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations en question : Les op\u00e9rations alternatives auraient permis \u00e0 Micsau d\u2019utiliser le PBR des actions de 3295. Le gain en capital r\u00e9alis\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de 53,7 M$, soit \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le gain en capital que 3295 a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce; et\ne)Elles ne constituent pas un abus de la RGA\u00c9 : Univar au para. 20; Porter aux pp. 277\u2013279.

Dans cette d\u00e9cision, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire log\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Section d\u2019appel de l\u2019immigration (SAI) de la Commission de l\u2019immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada, prise en vertu du paragraphe 68(4) de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, L.C. 2001, ch. 27 (LIPR).\n[2] Aux termes de sa d\u00e9cision, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a certifi\u00e9 la question suivante selon l\u2019alin\u00e9a 74(d) de la LIPR:\nL\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s contrevient-il au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, malgr\u00e9 le paragraphe 6(1) de la Charte, et, de ce fait, est-il inop\u00e9rant en vertu de l\u2019article 52 de la Charte?\n[3] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR assimile les infractions appel\u00e9es \u00ab hybrides \u00bb ou \u00ab mixtes \u00bb (infractions pouvant faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une poursuite par mise en accusation ou par proc\u00e9dure sommaire) \u00e0 des infractions punissables par mise en accusation, ind\u00e9pendamment du mode de poursuite effectivement retenu, pour les fins des paragraphes 36(1) et 36(2) de la LIPR.\n[4] La SAI a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR ne contrevenait pas \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, partie I de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, constituant l\u2019annexe B de la Loi de 1982 sur le Canada (R.-U.), 1982, c. 11. Compte tenu du fait que l\u2019appelant avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu coupable d\u2019un acte criminel et qu\u2019il avait par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivi par voie sommaire et reconnu coupable d\u2019une autre infraction mentionn\u00e9e au paragraphe 36(1) de la LIPR, la SAI a conclu que le paragraphe 68(4) de la LIPR trouvait application. Elle a donc annul\u00e9 le sursis \u00e0 la mesure de renvoi et class\u00e9 l\u2019appel.\n[5] L\u2019appelant soutient que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a err\u00e9 en concluant que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR ne violait pas l\u2019article 15 de la Charte.\n[6] Tout en affirmant ne pas attaquer le r\u00e9gime d\u2019expulsion pr\u00e9vu par la LIPR, l\u2019appelant fait valoir notamment qu\u2019en assimilant l\u2019infraction hybride \u00e0 un acte criminel, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR emp\u00eache le justiciable qui n\u2019est pas citoyen canadien de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des effets engendr\u00e9s par le choix du procureur de la Couronne, comme celui d\u2019\u00eatre trait\u00e9 et per\u00e7u \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la gravit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle de l\u2019infraction commise. En d\u2019autres termes, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR laisse croire que le non-citoyen a commis une infraction plus grave que celle pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu coupable. En attribuant aux non-citoyens une dangerosit\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ne pr\u00e9sentent pas r\u00e9ellement, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR, de par ses effets, ostracise les non-citoyens et perp\u00e9tue des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard.\n[7] Comme le pr\u00e9sent appel porte sur une d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale visant une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, cette Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a employ\u00e9 la norme de contr\u00f4le appropri\u00e9e et si elle l\u2019a appliqu\u00e9e correctement. En d\u2019autres termes, lorsque la Cour conclut que la bonne norme de contr\u00f4le a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e, elle doit se mettre \u00e0 la place de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et se concentrer sur la d\u00e9cision ayant fait l\u2019objet du contr\u00f4le judiciaire (Agraira c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2013 CSC 36 aux para. 45-47, r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9e dans Office r\u00e9gional de la sant\u00e9 du Nord c. Horrocks, 2021 CSC 42 aux para. 10-12).\n[8] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, nous sommes d\u2019avis que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a appliqu\u00e9 la norme de contr\u00f4le appropri\u00e9e, soit la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte, puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question constitutionnelle (Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65 aux para. 55-57).\n[9] De plus, nous sommes \u00e9galement d\u2019avis, et ce, essentiellement pour les m\u00eames motifs que ceux de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, que la SAI n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en d\u00e9terminant que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR ne viole pas le paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte.\n[10] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et cette Cour ont r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que le principe le plus fondamental du droit de l\u2019immigration est que le non-citoyen n\u2019a pas un droit absolu d\u2019entrer au Canada ou d\u2019y demeurer. Ce traitement diff\u00e9rent s\u2019explique par le concept m\u00eame de citoyennet\u00e9 et d\u00e9coule express\u00e9ment du paragraphe 6(1) de la Charte, lequel pr\u00e9voit que tout citoyen canadien a le droit de demeurer au Canada, d\u2019y entrer ou d\u2019en sortir. Le l\u00e9gislateur est donc en droit d\u2019adopter une politique en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration et de prescrire par l\u00e9gislation les conditions \u00e0 remplir par les non-citoyens pour qu\u2019il leur soit permis de demeurer au Canada (Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration) c. Chiarelli, [1992] 1 R.C.S. 711 aux pp. 733-734, 736; Chiarelli c. Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration), [1990] 2 C.F. 299 (C.A.F.) aux pp. 310-311; Medovarski c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), 2005 CSC 51 au para. 46; Charkaoui c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2007 CSC 9 au para. 129; Revell c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2019 CAF 262 au para. 54, autorisation de pourvoi \u00e0 la CSC refus\u00e9e, 38891 (2 avril 2020)). Consid\u00e9rant que l\u2019article 6 de la Charte autorise la diff\u00e9rence de traitement entre le citoyen et le non-citoyen, cette diff\u00e9rence ne peut contrevenir \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Charte puisqu\u2019une disposition de la Charte ne peut servir \u00e0 en annuler une autre (Chiarelli C.S.C. \u00e0 la p. 736; Chiarelli C.A.F. \u00e0 la p. 310; Lavoie c. Canada, 2002 CSC 23 au para. 44).\n[11] L\u2019argument de l\u2019appelant selon lequel certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments rattach\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019expulsion pourraient contrevenir \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Charte ne peut r\u00e9ussir. Autre que la distinction entre citoyens et non-citoyens, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a identifi\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment du r\u00e9gime d\u2019interdiction de territoire et d\u2019expulsion qui pourrait ouvrir la porte \u00e0 une contestation en vertu de l\u2019article 15 de la Charte.\n[12] Par ailleurs, lors de l\u2019audience, l\u2019appelant a fait valoir que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la LIPR \u00e9tait ambigu. L\u2019appelant ne nous a pas convaincu qu\u2019une telle ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 existe. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, cela ne suffirait pas \u00e0 rendre cette disposition contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Charte.\n[13] Nous devons donc r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question certifi\u00e9e de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\nQuestion : L\u2019alin\u00e9a 36(3)a) de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s contrevient-il au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, malgr\u00e9 le paragraphe 6(1) de la Charte, et, de ce fait, est-il inop\u00e9rant en vertu de l\u2019article 52 de la Charte?\nR\u00e9ponse : Non\n[14] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9 sans frais.\n\u00ab Sylvie E.

La CCI a accord\u00e9 ce montant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande d\u2019ajournement \u00e0 laquelle ce dernier s\u2019opposait.\n[2] Nous sommes tous d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel. La CCI ne pouvait ordonner des d\u00e9pens \u00e0 l\u2019appelant en l\u2019absence de repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites ou orales des parties et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, alors que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est demeur\u00e9 muet sur cet aspect. Les d\u00e9cisions soumises par l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne lui sont d\u2019aucun secours en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En effet, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne nous a pas convaincus que les circonstances tr\u00e8s particuli\u00e8res dans lesquelles ces d\u00e9cisions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues, avalisent le principe selon lequel la Cour puisse unilat\u00e9ralement ordonner des d\u00e9pens en l\u2019absence de repr\u00e9sentations orales ou \u00e9crites par les parties (voir Exeter c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2013 CAF 134 au para. 17; Canada c. Finch, 2002 CAF 194 aux para. 4\u20135; Mand v. Canada, 2023 FCA 94 au para. 7; Balogun c.

Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 les d\u00e9pens et l\u2019appelant, par cons\u00e9quent, n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019occasion de faire des repr\u00e9sentations sur la question.

Cette demande r\u00e9sultait de cotisations \u00e9tablies par le Ministre pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 1993 \u00e0 1998, et s\u2019appuyait principalement sur les d\u00e9clarations asserment\u00e9es de deux agents de recouvrement retrait\u00e9s de l\u2019Agence du Revenu du Canada qui pr\u00e9tendaient que les cotisations \u00e9taient mal fond\u00e9es.\n[2] Il est maintenant bien \u00e9tabli que notre Cour, lorsqu\u2019elle si\u00e8ge en appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale portant sur une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, doit d\u00e9terminer si le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a choisi la norme de contr\u00f4le appropri\u00e9e et l\u2019a appliqu\u00e9e correctement : Agraira c Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2013 CSC 36, [2013] 2 R.C.S. 559, aux paragraphes 45 et 46; Office r\u00e9gional de la sant\u00e9 du Nord c Horrocks, 2021 CSC 42. En l\u2019occurrence, les parties conviennent que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas err\u00e9 en choisissant la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable.\n[3] Apr\u00e8s avoir s\u00e9rieusement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites et orales de l\u2019appelant, nous sommes tous d\u2019avis que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a bien appliqu\u00e9 la norme de la raisonnabilit\u00e9 et pouvait \u00e0 bon droit rejeter la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Lorsque la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9pondu aux arguments soulev\u00e9s par la partie appelante, cette derni\u00e8re doit nous convaincre que le raisonnement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est erron\u00e9 : Banque de Montr\u00e9al c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2021 CAF 189, au para 4. En l\u2019occurrence, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a soigneusement analys\u00e9 tous les arguments de l\u2019appelant, et ce dernier n\u2019a pas rencontr\u00e9 son fardeau d\u2019identifier une faille dans les motifs de jugement donnant ouverture \u00e0 l\u2019intervention de cette Cour. Au contraire, l\u2019appelant nous invite essentiellement \u00e0 soupeser de nouveau la preuve pour en arriver \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente de celle retenue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Tel n\u2019est \u00e9videmment pas le r\u00f4le de cette Cour lorsqu\u2019elle si\u00e8ge en appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision en contr\u00f4le judiciaire appliquant la norme du caract\u00e8re raisonnable.\n[4] S\u2019agissant plus particuli\u00e8rement des d\u00e9clarations faites par les deux agents de recouvrement, le Ministre a fourni des motifs convaincants pour douter de leur v\u00e9racit\u00e9 et de leur exactitude et, somme toute, pour leur accorder peu de poids. Ces motifs sont intelligibles et appuy\u00e9s par la preuve, comme l\u2019a constat\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et permettaient de repousser la pr\u00e9somption de v\u00e9racit\u00e9 qui s\u2019attache \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration asserment\u00e9e.\n[5] Quant \u00e0 l\u2019importance qu\u2019aurait accord\u00e9e le Ministre au consentement \u00e0 jugement sign\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant, ce dernier ne nous a pas davantage convaincu qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte une entrave dans l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire. Tel que not\u00e9 par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le Ministre pouvait raisonnablement prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du syst\u00e8me fiscal et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9server l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus d\u2019appel dans l\u2019exercice de la discr\u00e9tion tr\u00e8s large en mati\u00e8re de remise que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 23(2) de la Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques, L.R.C. (1985), ch. F-11.\n[6] Enfin, l\u2019appelant a soulev\u00e9 plusieurs erreurs de fait qu\u2019aurait commises le Ministre dans ses motifs au soutien du rejet de sa demande de remise. Ces pr\u00e9tentions ont toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es et rejet\u00e9es par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, et nous sommes \u00e9galement d\u2019avis que les lacunes soulev\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant ne suffisent pas \u00e0 rendre la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable.\n[7] Pour tous ces motifs, l\u2019appel sera rejet\u00e9, avec d\u00e9pens.\n\u00ab Yves de Montigny \u00bb\nJuge en chef\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\nA-219-22\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nDJILLALI-LYES ABDAT c.

Monsieur Manoutchehr Bigdeli-Azari a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le 11 ao\u00fbt 2004 une demande de pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse (SV) et une demande de prestations de Suppl\u00e9ment de revenu garanti (SRG). Cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie en partie, du fait que M. Bigdeli-Azari n\u2019avait pas cumul\u00e9 les ann\u00e9es requises de r\u00e9sidence au Canada pour obtenir une pleine pension. Il a donc obtenu une pension partielle de 10\/40, et les prestations de la SV et de la SRG sont devenues payables \u00e0 partir de juillet 2005.\n[2] Le 20 ao\u00fbt 2007, le fils de M. Bigdeli-Azari (qui repr\u00e9sente \u00e9galement la succession de M. Bigdeli-Azari devant nous) a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme curateur aux biens et \u00e0 la personne de M. Bigdeli-Azari par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec. Un mois plus tard (soit le 25 septembre 2007), le curateur a avis\u00e9 le Ministre que M. Bigdeli-Azari avait quitt\u00e9 le pays, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un enl\u00e8vement. Le Ministre a donc suspendu les prestations de la SV et du SRG de M. Bigdeli-Azari \u00e0 partir du mois d\u2019avril 2008, soit six mois apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9part du Canada.\n[3] En avril 2016, le curateur a communiqu\u00e9 avec le Ministre pour r\u00e9clamer le paiement de toutes les prestations de la SV et du SRG de M. Bigdeli-Azari \u00e0 partir de la date \u00e0 laquelle elles ont cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre vers\u00e9es, au motif que son p\u00e8re aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 r\u00e9sident canadien m\u00eame s\u2019il ne s\u2019y trouvait plus \u00e0 la suite de son enl\u00e8vement. Le Ministre a refus\u00e9, en expliquant que M. Bigdeli-Azari ne pouvait toucher \u00e0 la pension de la SV \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada que pour les six mois suivants son d\u00e9part du Canada, du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas habit\u00e9 au Canada pendant au moins 20 ans apr\u00e8s son 18e anniversaire.\n[4] Finalement, le curateur a avis\u00e9 le Ministre du retour de M. Bigdeli-Azari au Canada en date du 11 ao\u00fbt 2016, et a de nouveau demand\u00e9 le paiement de toutes les prestations de la SV et du SRG ainsi que leur paiement r\u00e9troactif depuis la date o\u00f9 elles avaient cess\u00e9. Le Ministre a cependant re\u00e7u le 18 ao\u00fbt 2016 l\u2019avis de d\u00e9c\u00e8s de M. Bigdeli-Azari, en date du 14 ao\u00fbt 2016.\n[5] Le curateur a par la suite demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision du Ministre autorisant uniquement le versement de la pension de la SV pour le mois de retour au Canada, soit ao\u00fbt 2016. Le Ministre ayant maintenu sa d\u00e9cision initiale, la succession de M. Bigdeli-Azari a fait appel \u00e0 la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sociale. La Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel le 31 mars 2021, et cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par la Division d\u2019appel du m\u00eame Tribunal le 20 octobre 2021. C\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette d\u00e9cision que la succession a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[6] Il est bien \u00e9tabli depuis la d\u00e9cision rendue par cette Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hurtubise c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2016 CAF 147 (aux para. 5-6) que la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable aux d\u00e9cisions rendues par la Division d\u2019appel est celle de la raisonnabilit\u00e9. Notre Cour doit donc d\u00e9cider s\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnable pour la Division d\u2019appel de confirmer la d\u00e9cision de la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, compte tenu du paragraphe 58(1) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social, L.C. 2005, c. 34. Cette disposition n\u2019autorise la Division d\u2019appel \u00e0 intervenir que dans la mesure o\u00f9 la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas observ\u00e9 un principe de justice naturelle, a commis une erreur de droit ou s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur une conclusion de fait erron\u00e9e tir\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance.\n[7] Au terme de la Loi sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse, L.R.C. 1985, c. O-9 (\u00ab la Loi \u00bb), seule une personne ayant r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada pendant au moins vingt ans (apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e2ge de 18 ans) au moment de son d\u00e9part peut toucher une pension de la SV pendant qu\u2019elle se trouve \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada (para. 9(2)). Le paragraphe 9(1) pr\u00e9cise par ailleurs que la pension est suspendue \u00ab apr\u00e8s le sixi\u00e8me mois d\u2019absence ininterrompue du Canada qui suit l\u2019ouverture du droit \u00e0 la pension (\u2026) et il ne peut reprendre que le mois o\u00f9 le pensionn\u00e9 revient au Canada \u00bb. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 21(1)b) du R\u00e8glement sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse, C.R.C., c. 1246 pr\u00e9voit d\u2019autre part qu\u2019une personne est pr\u00e9sente au Canada \u00ab lorsqu\u2019elle se trouve physiquement dans une r\u00e9gion du Canada \u00bb.\n[8] Or, la preuve d\u00e9montre que M. Bigdeli-Azari s\u2019est absent\u00e9 du Canada pendant presque neuf ans, de 2008 \u00e0 2016, apr\u00e8s que la pension partielle de 10\/40 lui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e en juillet 2005. Le demandeur ne conteste pas que M. Bigdeli-Azari ne cumulait pas 20 ans de r\u00e9sidence avant son d\u00e9part du Canada, et ne remet pas en question non plus le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au Canada de 2008 \u00e0 2016. Sa pr\u00e9tention est plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un enl\u00e8vement ne constitue pas un d\u00e9part, et qu\u2019une personne ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e absente \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne quitte volontairement le Canada. Compte tenu du fait que la Loi et le R\u00e8glement sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse ne pr\u00e9voient pas d\u2019exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle selon laquelle la pension est suspendue en cas d\u2019absence de plus de six mois, m\u00eame pour des motifs humanitaires, et que le demandeur ne nous a soumis aucun pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent jurisprudentiel au soutien de son argumentation, la Division d\u2019appel pouvait raisonnablement conclure que la Loi ne lui accorde aucune discr\u00e9tion.\n[9] Nous sommes \u00e9galement d\u2019avis que la Division d\u2019appel pouvait raisonnablement conclure que la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019avait pas fait d\u00e9faut d\u2019observer un principe de justice naturelle ou d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Pour en arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, la Division d\u2019appel a \u00e9cout\u00e9 l\u2019enregistrement de l\u2019audience devant la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale; elle en a retenu que le demandeur n\u2019a soulev\u00e9 aucune objection de proc\u00e9dure, et qu\u2019il a eu l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter sa cause et de faire valoir ses arguments par \u00e9crit et oralement. Ces constats n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remis en question devant nous.\n[10] Enfin, nous sommes tous d\u2019opinion que les arguments fond\u00e9s sur la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s invoqu\u00e9s par le demandeur ne peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s par cette Cour. Dans une d\u00e9cision interlocutoire en date du 3 octobre 2019 (Dossier de la demanderesse, \u00e0 la p. 53), la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a refus\u00e9 d\u2019entendre les arguments du demandeur \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard en s\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 20(1)a) du R\u00e8glement sur le Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale, D.O.R.S.\/2013-60 tel qu\u2019il existait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Cette disposition pr\u00e9voyait qu\u2019une partie d\u00e9sirant soulever l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition devait envoyer un avis au Tribunal contenant la disposition vis\u00e9e et toutes observations \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la question soulev\u00e9e. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le demandeur n\u2019expliquait pas comment la ou les dispositions contest\u00e9es brimaient ses droits constitutionnels. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, la Division d\u2019appel a conclu que la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019avait commis aucune erreur dans son interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 20(1)a) du R\u00e8glement sur le Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale, et que les observations du demandeur \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa contestation constitutionnelle n\u2019\u00e9taient pas suffisamment pr\u00e9cises pour lui permettre de d\u00e9celer les grandes lignes d\u2019un argument fond\u00e9 sur la Charte. Or, le demandeur ne nous a pas convaincus du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[11] Pour tous ces motifs, la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire sera rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\n\u00ab Yves de Montigny \u00bb\nJuge en chef\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\nA-343-21\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nLA SUCCESSION DE MANOUTCHEHR BIGDELI-AZARI c.

ROBERT CHAD\nappelant\net\nLE MINISTRE DU REVENU NATIONAL\nintim\u00e9\nMOTIFS DE L\u2019ORDONNANCE\nLE JUGE LOCKE\nI. Contexte [1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision est rendue dans le cadre de l\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (2023 CF 1481, par la juge Martine St-Louis) radiant, sans autorisation de modifier, un avis de demande modifi\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant, S. Robert Chad. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a estim\u00e9 que la demande \u00e9tait manifestement irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re au point de n\u2019avoir aucune chance d\u2019\u00eatre accueillie.\n[2] M. Chad sollicite maintenant une ordonnance visant le contenu du dossier d\u2019appel. Il propose une liste de plusieurs documents, y compris (i) un affidavit \u00e0 son nom d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 10 mai 2023 (l\u2019affidavit de M. Chad) et utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa demande conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 306 des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, DORS\/98-106, ladite demande ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 radi\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et (ii) une transcription certifi\u00e9e de l\u2019audience devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale tenue le 30 octobre 2023 qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision port\u00e9e en appel (la transcription).\n[3] L\u2019intim\u00e9, le ministre du Revenu national (le ministre), s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de M. Chad seulement en ce qui concerne l\u2019affidavit de M. Chad et la transcription. Le ministre soutient que la transcription devrait \u00eatre exclue dans son ensemble. L\u2019affidavit de M. Chad devrait aussi \u00eatre exclu, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la pi\u00e8ce 7 qui est une mise en demeure de M. Chad dat\u00e9e du 1er novembre 2022 (la mise en demeure).\n[4] Les parties semblent s\u2019entendre pour dire que le contenu du dossier d\u2019appel doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux paragraphes 343(2) et 344(1) des R\u00e8gles et \u00e0 la jurisprudence s\u2019y rapportant. Le paragraphe 343(2) des R\u00e8gles pr\u00e9voit que le dossier d\u2019appel ne comprend \u00ab que les documents, pi\u00e8ces et transcriptions n\u00e9cessaires au r\u00e8glement des questions en litige dans l\u2019appel \u00bb. Le paragraphe 344(1) est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n344 (1) Le dossier d\u2019appel contient, sur des pages num\u00e9rot\u00e9es cons\u00e9cutivement, les documents ci-apr\u00e8s dans l\u2019ordre suivant :\n344 (1) An appeal book shall contain, on consecutively numbered pages and in the following order,\na) une table des mati\u00e8res d\u00e9signant chaque document;\n(a) a table of contents describing each document;\nb) l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019avis d\u2019appel incident;\n(b) the notice of appeal and any notice of cross-appeal;\nc) l\u2019ordonnance port\u00e9e en appel, telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e et inscrite ainsi que les motifs, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, y compris toute dissidence;\n(c) the order appealed from, as signed and entered, and any reasons, including dissenting reasons, given in respect of that order;\nd) l\u2019acte introductif d\u2019instance, les autres actes de proc\u00e9dure et tout autre document d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans la premi\u00e8re instance qui d\u00e9finit les questions en litige dans l\u2019appel;\n(d) the originating document, any other pleadings and any other document in the first instance that defines the issues in the appeal;\ne) sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), les documents, pi\u00e8ces et transcriptions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans l\u2019entente vis\u00e9e au paragraphe 343(1) ou dans l\u2019ordonnance qui en tient lieu;\n(e) subject to subsection (2), all documents, exhibits and transcripts agreed on under subsection 343(1) or ordered to be included on a motion under subsection 343(3);\nf) toute ordonnance relative au d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019appel;\n(f) any order made in respect of the conduct of the appeal;\ng) tout autre document pertinent;\n(g) any other document relevant to the appeal;\nh) l\u2019entente vis\u00e9e au paragraphe 343(1) ou l\u2019ordonnance qui en tient lieu;\n(h) an agreement reached under subsection 343(1) as to the contents of the appeal book or an order made under subsection 343(3); and\ni) le certificat \u00e9tabli selon la formule 344, sign\u00e9 par l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant et attestant que le contenu du dossier d\u2019appel est complet et lisible.\n(i) a certificate in Form 344, signed by the appellant\u2019s solicitor, stating that the contents of the appeal book are complete and legible.\nII. La transcription [5] Le ministre s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019inclusion de la transcription au dossier d\u2019appel parce qu\u2019elle ne contient que des arguments juridiques et qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire au r\u00e8glement des questions en litige dans l\u2019appel : Collins c. Canada, 2010 CAF 128, au para. 2. M. Chad soutient que le ministre a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans ses observations lors de l\u2019audience, auxquels M. Chad s\u2019est oppos\u00e9, et que la transcription ne se limite donc pas aux arguments juridiques. Le ministre affirme que les pr\u00e9tendus \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9taient de simples observations en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019argument de M. Chad selon lequel une demande d\u2019information en vertu de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, L.R.C. (1985), ch. A-1, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un autre recours appropri\u00e9.\n[6] M. Chad soutient que la limite relative au contenu du dossier d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 343(2) des R\u00e8gles est souple et qu\u2019un document doit \u00eatre inclus si une partie \u00ab peut raisonnablement estimer qu\u2019elle s\u2019en servira \u00e0 l\u2019appui d\u2019un de ses arguments \u00bb en appel. M. Chad invoque l\u2019arr\u00eat Bojangles\u2019 International, LLC c. Bojangles Caf\u00e9 Ltd., 2006 CAF 291, au para. 6, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cet argument, mais il va plus loin que le passage cit\u00e9. Ce dernier ne visait pas \u00e0 d\u00e9roger au principe selon lequel le document concern\u00e9 doit \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire au r\u00e8glement des questions en litige dans l\u2019appel. Le simple fait qu\u2019une partie souhaite se servir d\u2019un document n\u2019est pas suffisant.\n[7] Je suis d\u2019accord avec le ministre pour dire que les observations qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. De plus, rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es de la sorte par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. La question de savoir si une demande d\u2019information pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information constituait un autre recours appropri\u00e9 est une question de droit. La transcription n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher cette question; je ne suis pas non plus convaincu qu\u2019elle soit n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9gler toute autre question en litige dans l\u2019appel.\n[8] Je retiens l\u2019argument de M. Chad selon lequel un doute quant \u00e0 l\u2019inclusion d\u2019un document au dossier d\u2019appel doit \u00eatre r\u00e9solu en faveur de l\u2019inclusion (West Vancouver (District) c. Colombie-Britannique, 2005 CAF 281, au para. 4), mais je suis convaincu que la transcription ne doit pas \u00eatre incluse.\nIII. L\u2019affidavit de M. Chad [9] Le ministre s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019ajout de l\u2019affidavit de M. Chad au dossier d\u2019appel, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la mise en demeure, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale par l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties dans son dossier de requ\u00eate et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve. Le ministre reconna\u00eet que M. Chad a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 son affidavit dans ses observations \u00e9crites devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais il fait remarquer qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas inclus l\u2019affidavit dans son dossier de requ\u00eate. Le ministre souligne \u00e9galement que l\u2019avocat de M. Chad a reconnu explicitement lors de l\u2019audience devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qu\u2019il ne s\u2019appuyait pas sur l\u2019affidavit de M. Chad comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve.\n[10] De plus, le ministre attire l\u2019attention sur le fait que, dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate en radiation d\u2019un avis de demande, les faits qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s sont tenus pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s : Canada (Revenu national) c. JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc., 2013 CAF 250, au para. 52. Par cons\u00e9quent, aucune preuve n\u2019est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9tayer ces faits, que ce soit devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou devant notre Cour.\n[11] M. Chad soutient que son affidavit est n\u00e9cessaire pour contrer l\u2019argument du ministre voulant que l\u2019avis de demande modifi\u00e9 \u00ab renferme principalement des all\u00e9gations et des conclusions non \u00e9tay\u00e9es et conjecturales qui n\u2019appuient pas la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e \u00bb; argument qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. M. Chad fait valoir qu\u2019il se fonde sur son affidavit non pour la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de son contenu, mais comme preuve que les all\u00e9gations n\u2019\u00e9taient pas sans fondement.\n[12] \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019argument de M. Chad ne vient pas \u00e0 bout des faits suivants : (i) aucune preuve n\u2019est n\u00e9cessaire dans une requ\u00eate en radiation, (ii) l\u2019affidavit de M. Chad n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve dans les dossiers de requ\u00eate des parties, et (iii) M. Chad a explicitement reconnu qu\u2019il ne s\u2019appuyait pas sur l\u2019affidavit comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve.\n[13] Le ministre reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il faut inclure la mise en demeure au dossier d\u2019appel parce qu\u2019elle est mentionn\u00e9e dans l\u2019avis de demande modifi\u00e9 en litige. En guise de r\u00e9ponse, M. Chad soutient que la reconnaissance par le ministre de la pertinence de la mise en demeure dans le pr\u00e9sent appel doit servir de reconnaissance de la pertinence de l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de l\u2019affidavit. Selon ses propres termes \u00ab ce qui est bon pour l\u2019un l\u2019est aussi pour l\u2019autre \u00bb. J\u2019estime que l\u2019expression n\u2019est pas appropri\u00e9e dans ce contexte. Cela pourrait s\u2019appliquer si l\u2019argument du ministre \u00e9tait favoris\u00e9 de quelque fa\u00e7on par l\u2019ajout de la mise en demeure dans le dossier d\u2019appel, mais je ne vois aucune indication en ce sens. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019ajout de la mise en demeure dans le dossier d\u2019appel n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9, seule l\u2019insertion du reste de l\u2019affidavit de M. Chad l\u2019est.\n[14] Je suis d\u2019accord avec le ministre pour dire que l\u2019essentiel de l\u2019affidavit de M. Chad devrait \u00eatre exclu du dossier d\u2019appel parce qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve. La mise en demeure doit \u00eatre incluse parce que son ajout n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 et parce qu\u2019elle est mentionn\u00e9e dans l\u2019avis de demande modifi\u00e9.\nIV. Conclusion [15] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j\u2019ordonnerai l\u2019ajout au dossier d\u2019appel des documents propos\u00e9s par le ministre, tels qu\u2019ils sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe A de son dossier de requ\u00eate en r\u00e9ponse. J\u2019ordonnerai \u00e9galement \u00e0 M. Chad de payer les d\u00e9pens du ministre pour la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire.\n\u00ab George R.

La Division d\u2019appel s\u2019est dite d\u2019avis que la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en concluant que le demandeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en raison de son inconduite.

(1985), ch. 1 (5e suppl.) (la LIR). Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le ministre confirmait son intention de r\u00e9voquer l\u2019enregistrement de Sigma Chi en tant qu\u2019organisme de bienfaisance.\n[2] La fondation Sigma Chi est enregistr\u00e9e comme organisme de bienfaisance depuis 1992. Elle se d\u00e9crit comme une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019aide mutuelle internationale comptant, au Canada et aux \u00c9tats-Unis, 244 sections actives de premier cycle et 152 sections d\u2019anciens dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s. L\u2019un de ses objectifs, selon ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de l\u2019enregistrement, \u00e9tait d\u2019[traduction] \u00ab aider les \u00e9tudiants m\u00e9ritants dans le besoin (de premier, deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me cycles) inscrits dans des \u00e9tablissements d\u2019enseignement sup\u00e9rieur au Canada \u00e0 y poursuivre et terminer leurs \u00e9tudes \u00bb.\n[3] Un organisme doit satisfaire \u00e0 des exigences l\u00e9gales pour pouvoir \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme organisme de bienfaisance et le demeurer. En 2010 et 2011, l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019ARC) a audit\u00e9 les activit\u00e9s de Sigma Chi. L\u2019audit a permis de relever certains points de non-conformit\u00e9, notamment l\u2019omission de la fondation Sigma Chi de consacrer la totalit\u00e9 de ses ressources \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s de bienfaisance et l\u2019octroi d\u2019avantages personnels aux membres. L\u2019audit a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que la majorit\u00e9 des bourses de la fondation n\u2019\u00e9taient offertes qu\u2019aux membres.\n[4] Le ministre et Sigma Chi ont conclu un accord de conformit\u00e9 en mars 2011 afin de r\u00e9soudre les probl\u00e8mes r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par l\u2019audit. Dans cet accord, Sigma Chi s\u2019engageait notamment \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab consacrer la totalit\u00e9 de ses ressources \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s de bienfaisance \u00bb et \u00e0 ne pas limiter ses bourses et son aide financi\u00e8re aux membres de la fondation.\n[5] L\u2019ARC a entam\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me audit en novembre 2017. Le ministre a inform\u00e9 Sigma Chi des conclusions de l\u2019audit selon lesquelles Sigma Chi ne respectait pas les exigences de la loi, notamment parce qu\u2019elle ne consacrait pas ses ressources \u00e0 ses propres activit\u00e9s de bienfaisance, ne tenait pas de registres et de livres de comptes ad\u00e9quats et d\u00e9livrait des re\u00e7us fiscaux non conformes. L\u2019audit a \u00e9galement r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours des exercices financiers 2015 et 2016, respectivement 61 % et 74 % de toutes les ressources consacr\u00e9es aux bourses d\u2019\u00e9tudes et aux r\u00e9compenses \u00e9taient destin\u00e9es \u00e0 des \u00ab bourses internes \u00bb r\u00e9serv\u00e9es aux membres et aux candidats admis et que certaines bourses \u00e9taient attribu\u00e9es en fonction du r\u00f4le du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire au sein de Sigma Chi ou de sa fa\u00e7on de repr\u00e9senter les id\u00e9aux de la fondation. Selon l\u2019audit, les activit\u00e9s de Sigma Chi visaient principalement \u00e0 servir l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des membres et non du public (contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019exige la LIR dans le cas d\u2019un organisme de bienfaisance enregistr\u00e9).\n[6] Sigma Chi a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites au ministre en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019audit. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 ces observations, le ministre a jug\u00e9 que Sigma Chi ne remplissait pas les conditions d\u2019enregistrement des organismes de bienfaisance et a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 un avis d\u2019intention de r\u00e9voquer l\u2019enregistrement. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cet avis, Sigma Chi a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis d\u2019opposition. Le ministre a examin\u00e9 les arguments avanc\u00e9s par Sigma Chi \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son opposition, mais a conclu qu\u2019ils ne d\u00e9montraient pas que Sigma Chi remplissait les conditions n\u00e9cessaires au maintien de son enregistrement. Toutefois, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition, de cesser d\u2019invoquer l\u2019un des motifs qu\u2019il avait initialement avanc\u00e9, soit le non-respect des exigences relatives \u00e0 la tenue de registres et de livres de comptes \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 230(2) de la LIR.\n[7] Le ministre invoque maintenant trois motifs de r\u00e9vocation : (1) Sigma Chi accordait des avantages \u00e0 ses membres et n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas administr\u00e9e exclusivement \u00e0 des fins de bienfaisance comme l\u2019exige l\u2019alin\u00e9a 149.1(1)a) de la LIR; (2) elle versait des fonds \u00e0 des donataires non reconnus, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 149.1(1)a.1); (3) elle n\u2019exer\u00e7ait aucun contr\u00f4le et n\u2019avait aucune emprise sur les fonds envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 une organisation am\u00e9ricaine, et ne consacrait donc pas la totalit\u00e9 de ses ressources aux activit\u00e9s de bienfaisance qu\u2019elle menait elle-m\u00eame, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 149.1(1)a.1) : Canadian Committee for the Tel Aviv Foundation c. Canada, 2002 CAF 72, au para. 40.\n[8] Sigma Chi conteste ces trois conclusions. Il est commun\u00e9ment admis que la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de telles conclusions est la norme de l\u2019erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante, qui appelle un degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de retenue. Ainsi, pour que la Cour modifie la d\u00e9cision du ministre fond\u00e9e sur ces conclusions, Sigma Chi doit d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019une erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chacune des trois conclusions : Colel Chabad Lubavitch Foundation of Israel c. Canada (Revenu national), 2022 CAF 108, aux paras. 49 et 51. Sigma Chi soutient \u00e9galement que le ministre a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et que sa conduite suscite une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. Nous ne sommes pas d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle ait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ces pr\u00e9tentions.\n[9] Premi\u00e8rement, nous ne relevons aucune erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante dans la conclusion selon laquelle Sigma Chi accordait des avantages \u00e0 ses membres au moyen de bourses d\u2019\u00e9tudes internes. Sigma Chi affirme que ces bourses sont offertes \u00e0 tous les \u00e9tudiants universitaires de sexe masculin pouvant demander \u00e0 devenir membres de la fondation, mais elles ne sont vers\u00e9es en fin de compte qu\u2019\u00e0 ceux qui sont admis en tant que membres ou candidats. En outre, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019engagement pris par Sigma Chi dans l\u2019accord de conformit\u00e9 de [traduction] \u00ab consacrer la totalit\u00e9 de ses ressources \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s de bienfaisance \u00bb et de ne pas restreindre les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires du programme de bourses et d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation, le dossier montre que Sigma Chi a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 accorder des bourses internes en 2015, 2016, 2020 et 2021. En 2015 et 2016, Sigma Chi a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 respectivement 75 % et 82 % des fonds de bourses d\u2019\u00e9tudes \u00e0 ses membres et candidats admis. En 2020 et 2021, Sigma Chi a accord\u00e9 216 760 $ en bourses internes. Le ministre souligne \u00e9galement qu\u2019au moment de l\u2019enregistrement, l\u2019objectif d\u00e9clar\u00e9 de Sigma Chi d\u2019aider les \u00e9tudiants \u00e0 poursuivre des \u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures ne faisait aucunement mention d\u2019une quelconque restriction en faveur des membres ou des candidats admis. Pas plus tard qu\u2019en mai 2023, Sigma Chi d\u00e9clarait sur son site Web que [traduction] \u00ab [l]a Fondation sert de moyen, pour les sections locales actives, les sections d\u2019anciens dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s et les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019habitation, de recueillir des fonds d\u00e9ductibles d\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 des fins \u00e9ducatives, principalement au profit des sections actives et des membres actifs \u00bb (non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original), ce qui ne constitue pas une fin de bienfaisance au sens de la LIR.\n[10] Deuxi\u00e8mement, nous ne d\u00e9celons pas non plus d\u2019erreur susceptible de r\u00e9vision dans la conclusion du ministre selon laquelle Sigma Chi a fourni des fonds \u00e0 des donataires non reconnus en accordant des pr\u00eats aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019habitation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019aide mutuelle Sigma Chi, cr\u00e9\u00e9es pour fournir des logements aux membres. En outre, la fondation n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 l\u2019accord de conformit\u00e9, car elle n\u2019a pas obtenu de garantie pour les pr\u00eats consentis \u00e0 London Sigma Chi Properties et a accord\u00e9 une nouvelle avance \u00e0 London Sigma Chi Properties, en d\u00e9pit des obligations qui lui incombaient aux termes de cet accord. Les pr\u00eats et avances accord\u00e9s \u00e0 London Sigma Chi Properties mettaient en jeu des sommes importantes. Selon le premier audit, les pr\u00eats s\u2019\u00e9levaient \u00e0 403 015 $. L\u2019avance suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e9tait de 25 000 $.\n[11] Troisi\u00e8mement, nous ne voyons aucune erreur susceptible de r\u00e9vision dans la conclusion du ministre selon laquelle Sigma Chi n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 conserver un contr\u00f4le ou une emprise sur le programme Horizon Scholarship financ\u00e9 en partie par Sigma Chi et administr\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Comme le souligne le ministre, Sigma Chi ne dispose que d\u2019un seul des huit si\u00e8ges au conseil d\u2019administration et de deux des seize si\u00e8ges du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection. La conclusion du ministre selon laquelle Sigma Chi n\u2019exer\u00e7ait aucun contr\u00f4le ni emprise sur l\u2019utilisation de ses fonds \u00e9tait amplement \u00e9tay\u00e9e par le dossier.\n[12] Enfin, \u00e0 notre avis, Sigma Chi n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 et il n\u2019y a pas eu de manquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[13] Le crit\u00e8re permettant d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 quelle conclusion en arriverait une personne bien renseign\u00e9e qui \u00e9tudierait la question en profondeur, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste et pratique. Croirait-elle que, selon toute vraisemblance, le d\u00e9cideur, consciemment ou non, ne rendra pas une d\u00e9cision juste? : Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon, district scolaire # 23 c. Yukon (Procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale), [Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon] 2015 CSC 25, au para. 20. Le fardeau qui incombe \u00e0 la partie qui all\u00e8gue l\u2019existence d\u2019une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 est \u00e9lev\u00e9 : Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon, au para. 26. Les motifs invoqu\u00e9s par Sigma Chi pour all\u00e9guer une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 ne satisfont pas \u00e0 ce fardeau \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n[14] Sigma Chi soutient que la conduite du ministre soul\u00e8ve une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il a trait\u00e9 la fondation d\u2019une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente des autres organisations qui limitent leurs bourses d\u2019\u00e9tudes \u00e0 un sous-ensemble du public. Elle mentionne les bourses offertes par l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Toronto qui sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9es aux \u00e9tudiants inscrits au Trinity College. Toutefois, comme la Cour l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans un contexte fiscal, le fait que d\u2019autres personnes aient b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019une exon\u00e9ration n\u2019est pas pertinent pour d\u00e9terminer si un contribuable donn\u00e9 devrait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de cette m\u00eame exon\u00e9ration : Sinclair c. Canada, 2003 CAF 348, au para. 7. M\u00eame si les comparaisons \u00e9taient pertinentes, le dossier dont nous disposons est loin de fournir une base probante sur laquelle la Cour pourrait \u00e9tablir des comparaisons significatives.\n[15] Sigma Chi soutient \u00e9galement que le refus du ministre de prendre en consid\u00e9ration les offres de Sigma Chi de prendre des mesures correctives constitue le fondement de la crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. Toutefois, comme le fait remarquer le ministre, Sigma Chi a eu trois occasions de r\u00e9pondre en bonne et due forme aux questions soulev\u00e9es par le ministre. Il ressort du dossier dont nous disposons que les observations de Sigma Chi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises au s\u00e9rieux et ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen approfondi. Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec le ministre pour dire que Sigma Chi n\u2019avait pas le droit de continuer \u00e0 n\u00e9gocier d\u2019autres mesures correctives, compte tenu notamment du non\u2011 respect de ses obligations aux termes de l\u2019accord de conformit\u00e9.\n[16] Pour ces motifs, nous rejetterons l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens, lesquels sont fix\u00e9s \u00e0 5 000 $, tout inclus, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019entente des parties.\n\u00ab J.

L\u2019inclusion, dans un suppl\u00e9ment au dossier d\u2019appel, des transcriptions des audiences tenues devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t et des pi\u00e8ces R-2 et R-3;\n2.

L\u2019autorisation donn\u00e9e aux parties de modifier leurs m\u00e9moires des faits et du droit respectifs.\n[3] L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019introduction de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et \u00e0 la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration de M. Tinkham dans ses fonctions. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ajoute \u00e9galement qu\u2019il sollicite de la Cour une ordonnance confirmant le bien-fond\u00e9 du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un seul avis d\u2019appel relativement \u00e0 deux instances distinctes devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t.\n[4] Par ailleurs, j\u2019ai re\u00e7u et examin\u00e9 la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019appelante aux observations formul\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet de la requ\u00eate, ainsi qu\u2019une lettre dans laquelle l\u2019appelante demande, d\u2019une part, une prorogation du d\u00e9lai dans lequel elle peut d\u00e9poser une r\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e et, d\u2019autre part, l\u2019autorisation de pr\u00e9senter un affidavit suppl\u00e9mentaire relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Je crois comprendre que l\u2019appelante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re demande en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 un argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon lequel l\u2019affidavit no 2 qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 pour \u00e9tayer sa requ\u00eate contient des arguments et des faits non utiles et dont on ne devrait pas tenir compte. J\u2019ai pris cet argument en consid\u00e9ration et conclu qu\u2019on doit tenir compte de cet affidavit. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 il contient des arguments, je le traiterai en cons\u00e9quence. J\u2019estime donc qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande formul\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante dans sa lettre et que je peux maintenant trancher la requ\u00eate.\n[5] Avant de me pencher sur les questions en litige soulev\u00e9es dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il est utile d\u2019expliquer quelque peu le contexte. La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a rendu la d\u00e9cision qui fait l\u2019objet du pr\u00e9sent appel le 30 mai 2022 et l\u2019avis d\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant notre Cour le 30 juin 2022. Aucun progr\u00e8s n\u2019ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 au mois de mars suivant, la Cour s\u2019est adress\u00e9e aux parties en vue de trouver une solution. Dans une ordonnance dat\u00e9e du 12 mai 2023, la Cour a \u00e9labor\u00e9 un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u et pris en consid\u00e9ration les commentaires des parties et elle a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer le dossier d\u2019appel. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a donc pr\u00e9par\u00e9 et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le dossier d\u2019appel, mais l\u2019appelante estimait qu\u2019il manquait certains documents. Dans une directive dat\u00e9e du 1er f\u00e9vrier 2024, la Cour, soulignant \u00e0 nouveau le fait qu\u2019aucun progr\u00e8s n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent appel, a invit\u00e9 l\u2019appelante \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en bonne et due forme si elle estimait vraiment qu\u2019il manquait des documents dans le dossier d\u2019appel. Il s\u2019agit de la requ\u00eate que notre Cour est maintenant appel\u00e9e \u00e0 trancher.\nII. Nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve [6] Les parties ont convenu que toute partie qui cherche \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve doit \u00e9tablir ce qui suit : (1) elle n\u2019aurait pas pu les produire au proc\u00e8s m\u00eame si elle avait fait preuve de diligence raisonnable; (2) ils sont importants, en ce sens qu\u2019ils portent sur une question d\u00e9cisive ou potentiellement d\u00e9cisive quant \u00e0 l\u2019appel; (3) ils sont plausibles, en ce sens qu\u2019on peut raisonnablement consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019ils sont dignes de foi; et (4) ils sont tels que, s\u2019ils sont dignes de foi, on peut raisonnablement penser qu\u2019ils auraient influ\u00e9 sur le r\u00e9sultat, et s\u2019ils ne satisfont pas au crit\u00e8re qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la Cour a tout de m\u00eame un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire r\u00e9siduel lui permettant de les admettre en appel, bien que ce pouvoir doive \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice, avec parcimonie et uniquement dans les cas les plus clairs (voir Coady c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale), 2019 CAF 102, au para. 3).\n[7] Cela dit, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que l\u2019appelante cherche \u00e0 introduire ne doivent pas \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s devant la Cour pour les motifs suivants :\n[TRADUCTION]\n1. En ce qui concerne les d\u00e9clarations de revenus, l\u2019importance de ces documents a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appelante et \u00e0 M. Tinkham lors de la pr\u00e9sentation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, mais ils n\u2019ont fait aucune tentative en vue de les pr\u00e9senter en preuve avant le stade des plaidoyers finaux;\n2. En ce qui concerne les lettres de la Dre Raynor (qui semblent \u00eatre dat\u00e9es du 21 avril 2011 et du 8 f\u00e9vrier 2019), la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t les a exclues \u00e0 titre de ou\u00ef-dire inadmissible et l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas fait t\u00e9moigner la Dre Raynor \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard; l\u2019intim\u00e9 avance \u00e9galement que la lettre du 8 f\u00e9vrier 2019 manque de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle n\u2019exposait pas seulement un avis m\u00e9dical, mais \u00e9galement des arguments favorables \u00e0 l\u2019appelante;\n3. En ce qui concerne le document du ministre des Finances de la C.-B., l\u2019appelante aurait pu le mettre en preuve au proc\u00e8s si elle avait agi avec diligence raisonnable;\n4. En ce qui concerne les publications de l\u2019ARC, il s\u2019agit de sources faisant autorit\u00e9 et non d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas satisfait aux exigences applicables qui lui auraient permis de soumettre l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019elle souhaitait pr\u00e9senter, et que la pr\u00e9sente affaire n\u2019est pas l\u2019un des cas les plus clairs dans lesquels la Cour devrait exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire r\u00e9siduel dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice.\n[9] En ce qui concerne les d\u00e9clarations de revenus, l\u2019appelante avance qu\u2019elle a eu du mal \u00e0 les trouver, ajoutant qu\u2019elle a tent\u00e9 de les mettre en preuve avant le d\u00e9but des plaidoyers finaux. Pour ce qui est des lettres de la Dre Raynor, l\u2019appelante soutient qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de faire t\u00e9moigner cette derni\u00e8re, car elle (la Dre Raynor) avait pris des cong\u00e9s prolong\u00e9s tout juste apr\u00e8s avoir fourni sa lettre du 8 f\u00e9vrier 2019 et qu\u2019elle avait pris sa retraite \u00e0 son retour de cong\u00e9s. L\u2019appelante fait \u00e9galement valoir que le juge de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t avait indiqu\u00e9 que les lettres de la Dre Raynor ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en preuve dans le cadre de son t\u00e9moignage. En ce qui concerne le document du ministre des Finances de la C.-B., l\u2019appelante ne souscrit pas \u00e0 l\u2019avis selon lequel elle aurait pu pr\u00e9senter cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve au proc\u00e8s si elle avait agi avec diligence raisonnable. Pour ce qui est des publications de l\u2019ARC, l\u2019appelante semble accepter le fait qu\u2019elle peut y renvoyer en tant que sources faisant autorit\u00e9 plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en tant qu\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[10] Je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 que la Cour ne doit pas permettre \u00e0 l\u2019appelante de pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en vertu de l\u2019article 351 des R\u00e8gles. L\u2019appelante \u00e9tait au courant de l\u2019importance que rev\u00eataient les d\u00e9clarations de revenus et les lettres de la Dre Raynor et elle ne m\u2019a pas convaincu qu\u2019elle avait fait preuve de diligence raisonnable en tentant de les mettre en preuve. Elle renvoie \u00e0 une pi\u00e8ce produite en preuve au proc\u00e8s pour \u00e9tablir que la Dre Raynor \u00e9tait en vacances, mais ne mentionne aucun \u00e9change qu\u2019elle aurait eu avec la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t au cours duquel elle aurait soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle devait se fonder sur les lettres de la Dre Raynor, m\u00eame s\u2019agissait d\u2019une preuve par ou\u00ef-dire, car cette derni\u00e8re ne pouvait pas t\u00e9moigner. Par ailleurs, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas convenablement document\u00e9 son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a initialement indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pouvait produire les lettres de la Dre Raynor dans le cadre de son t\u00e9moignage. Enfin, je ne trouve pas convaincante l\u2019all\u00e9gation non fond\u00e9e de l\u2019appelante selon laquelle elle n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de mettre en preuve le document du ministre des Finances de la C.-B. au proc\u00e8s, m\u00eame si elle avait fait preuve de diligence raisonnable.\n[11] N\u00e9anmoins, l\u2019appelante soutient dans son avis d\u2019appel que la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a commis une erreur en refusant d\u2019accepter en preuve \u00e0 tout le moins les d\u00e9clarations de revenus et les lettres de la Dre Raynor. Or, pour d\u00e9terminer si la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a commis une erreur \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, il faudra que notre Cour puisse consulter ces documents. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien qu\u2019ils ne soient pas admis en tant que nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, ces documents doivent \u00eatre inclus dans le dossier d\u2019appel.\nIII. Suppl\u00e9ment au dossier d\u2019appel [12] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 le consentement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 que j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, la seule question en litige qu\u2019il reste \u00e0 trancher en ce qui concerne le suppl\u00e9ment au dossier d\u2019appel est celle de savoir qui aura la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019ordonner les transcriptions et de payer les frais \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. L\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale selon laquelle il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019appelante de faire le n\u00e9cessaire en vue de la production des transcriptions, au besoin, aux fins de l\u2019appel. L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait \u00e9galement remarquer que l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas \u00e9tay\u00e9 sa d\u00e9claration selon laquelle elle n\u2019a pas les moyens de payer les frais relatifs aux transcriptions.\n[13] Je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9. L\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas fourni suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments probants pour me convaincre qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas les moyens de payer les frais relatifs aux transcriptions. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, je ne suis pas convaincu qu\u2019il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de payer les frais des transcriptions qui serviront \u00e0 \u00e9tayer l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par l\u2019appelante.\n[14] Cela dit, il semble bien que l\u2019appelante n\u2019ait pas besoin des transcriptions. En effet, le site Web de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t indique que les enregistrements sonores des audiences tenues devant elle sont communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 toute partie, sur demande, aux fins de tout appel. L\u2019obtention de ces enregistrements \u00e9viterait les frais importants li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019obtention des transcriptions.\n[15] J\u2019ordonnerai donc que les transcriptions ou les enregistrements sonores soient inclus dans le dossier d\u2019appel, mais que c\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019appelante qu\u2019il incombe de les obtenir.\nIV. M\u00e9moires modifi\u00e9s des faits et du droit [16] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, les parties conviennent qu\u2019elles devraient \u00eatre en mesure de d\u00e9poser des m\u00e9moires modifi\u00e9s des faits et du droit afin de refl\u00e9ter le contenu du suppl\u00e9ment au dossier d\u2019appel. Il convient d\u2019adopter une telle approche. Je vais donc \u00e9laborer un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier en vue de l\u2019\u00e9change de m\u00e9moires modifi\u00e9s des faits et du droit qui refl\u00e9tera la pr\u00e9occupation que l\u2019appelante a express\u00e9ment soulev\u00e9e quant au court d\u00e9lai qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 pour d\u00e9poser la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[17] Au paragraphe 46 des observations \u00e9crites qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es pour \u00e9tayer la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, l\u2019appelante a laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019elle voudrait pr\u00e9senter un m\u00e9moire des faits et du droit qui contiendrait plus que les 30 pages habituellement autoris\u00e9es. Cependant, elle n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019argument \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et je ne vois pas en quoi elle aurait besoin de plus de 30 pages pour plaider sa cause.\nV. M. Tinkham [18] L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration de M. Tinkham dans ses fonctions de repr\u00e9sentant judiciaire de l\u2019appelante \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que notre Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 refus\u00e9 une telle demande dans son ordonnance dat\u00e9e du 12 mai 2023. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019appelante se contente d\u2019affirmer qu\u2019elle est en d\u00e9saccord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[19] Je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne convient pas de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer M. Tinkham dans ses fonctions. La Cour s\u2019est pench\u00e9e sur cette question dans son ordonnance dat\u00e9e du 12 mai 2023 et elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que M. Tinkham ne devrait pas se voir accorder le droit de pr\u00e9senter des observations pour le compte de l\u2019appelante dans le cadre de l\u2019audience relative au pr\u00e9sent appel. Je ne vois aucune raison de modifier cette d\u00e9cision.\nVI. Appels joints [20] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait remarquer qu\u2019un seul avis d\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t qui se rapporte \u00e0 deux instances devant cette cour. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient donc que la pr\u00e9sente instance porte sur deux appels qui devraient \u00eatre joints, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada c. Microbjo Properties Inc., 2023 CAF 157 (arr\u00eat Microbjo), au para. 2.\n[21] \u00c0 mon avis, les circonstances entourant le pr\u00e9sent appel peuvent \u00eatre distingu\u00e9es de celles de l\u2019arr\u00eat Microbjo. Les motifs expos\u00e9s dans cet arr\u00eat se rapportaient \u00e0 cinq jugements distincts relatifs \u00e0 cinq instances devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a rendu un seul jugement relativement \u00e0 deux instances, et c\u2019est ce jugement qui fait l\u2019objet du pr\u00e9sent appel. Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un seul avis d\u2019appel \u00e9tait donc appropri\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nVII. Conclusion [22] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelante sera accueillie en partie. Ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre des parties n\u2019ayant demand\u00e9 des d\u00e9pens relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, je n\u2019en adjugerai pas.\n\u00ab George R.

Il a port\u00e9 sa cause devant le Conseil canadien des relations industrielles (le Conseil) en vertu du paragraphe 241(3) du Code canadien du travail, L.R.C. 1985, c. L-2 (le Code).\n[2] La pr\u00e9sente affaire d\u00e9coule principalement d\u2019un incident survenu en septembre 2019 (l\u2019Incident) lorsque le demandeur, dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions, a pris l\u2019appel d\u2019une cliente de la d\u00e9fenderesse qui aurait tenu \u00e0 son \u00e9gard des propos racistes. S\u2019en est suivi, selon le demandeur, une s\u00e9rie d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e8nements (suspension sans solde de trois jours, harc\u00e8lement de la superviseure imm\u00e9diate, d\u00e9ductions inexpliqu\u00e9es sur sa paye et promesse non-tenue), qui aurait men\u00e9 \u00e0 sa d\u00e9mission, non-volontaire selon lui, en juin 2022. Le demandeur s\u2019est plaint devant le Conseil que la d\u00e9fenderesse aurait fait d\u00e9faut de mettre en place les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer un milieu de travail sain, exempt de harc\u00e8lement, de discrimination ou de violence, violant ainsi une condition essentielle du contrat de travail, et aurait, dans la foul\u00e9e de l\u2019Incident, adopt\u00e9 un comportement permettant de conclure qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait plus l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00eatre li\u00e9e par ce contrat.\n[3] Le 2 d\u00e9cembre 2022, dans une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9pertori\u00e9e \u00e0 2022 CCRI 1052, le Conseil a rejet\u00e9 la plainte du demandeur, estimant qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu de cong\u00e9diement injuste et que le demandeur avait plut\u00f4t volontairement d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste.\n[4] Devant nous, le demandeur se pourvoit en contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision du Conseil. Il reproche au Conseil des manquements aux r\u00e8gles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, une erreur de droit et des erreurs de fait et de droit.\n[5] En mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, la Cour doit elle-m\u00eame d\u00e9terminer, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du dossier qui est devant elle, s\u2019il y a eu manquement (Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique Limit\u00e9e c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CAF 69 au para. 54). Ici, le demandeur soutient que le Conseil aurait mis trop de temps \u00e0 entendre la plainte, lui aurait refus\u00e9 d\u2019enregistrer les audiences, l\u2019aurait priv\u00e9 d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve important en jugeant non-pertinent, dans une d\u00e9cision interlocutoire, l\u2019enregistrement de l\u2019Incident, alors qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019audience elle a permis, \u00e0 la demande de la d\u00e9fenderesse, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une version partielle de cet enregistrement, et aurait accept\u00e9 la demande de la d\u00e9fenderesse de disjoindre la question des dommages sans v\u00e9ritablement expliqu\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision.\n[6] Nous sommes tous d\u2019avis que ces arguments ne peuvent r\u00e9ussir. D\u2019une part, quant au d\u00e9lai \u00e0 traiter sa plainte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en janvier 2020, le demandeur a reconnu \u00e0 l\u2019audience devant nous que la pand\u00e9mie de la COVID-19 pouvait expliquer le d\u00e9lai. La Cour note aussi qu\u2019\u00e0 partir de l\u2019automne 2021, et jusqu\u2019au d\u00e9but des audiences, en juin 2022, le Conseil a eu \u00e0 traiter de multiples questions pr\u00e9liminaires en lien avec la plainte du demandeur. Bref, cet argument est sans fondement, sans compter que le demandeur n\u2019a pas fait la preuve d\u2019un quelconque pr\u00e9judice en lien avec ce d\u00e9lai. Quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Conseil de ne pas permettre l\u2019enregistrement des audiences, celui-ci est ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure et n\u2019a pas pour pratique de le permettre. En outre, le demandeur n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ce qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 en l\u2019instance est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement accord\u00e9 aux plaignants qui comparaissent devant le Conseil. Cela vaut aussi pour la d\u00e9cision du Conseil de disjoindre la question des dommages, ce qui se fait relativement couramment. Finalement, l\u2019argument fond\u00e9 sur le d\u00e9p\u00f4t, \u00e0 l\u2019audience, d\u2019une version partielle de l\u2019enregistrement de l\u2019Incident n\u2019a aucun m\u00e9rite puisque rien n\u2019en retourne, le Conseil ayant tenu pour av\u00e9r\u00e9, aux fins de son analyse, que le demandeur avait fait l\u2019objet de propos inacceptables lors de l\u2019Incident.\n[7] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019erreur de droit et aux erreurs de fait et de droit imput\u00e9es au Conseil, c\u2019est suivant la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable que nous devons les examiner (Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65 (Vavilov)). Le demandeur soutient, pour l\u2019essentiel, que le Conseil aurait err\u00e9 en droit en omettant de consid\u00e9rer que la d\u00e9fenderesse avait fait d\u00e9faut de lui communiquer les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e en marge de l\u2019Incident et de tenter de r\u00e9gler la situation \u00e0 l\u2019amiable. Cela constituerait, selon lui, une violation d\u2019une condition essentielle du contrat de travail donnant ouverture \u00e0 une conclusion de cong\u00e9diement injuste. Quant aux erreurs de fait et de droit, elles seraient de deux ordres : d\u2019une part, le Conseil n\u2019aurait pas mesur\u00e9 convenablement l\u2019impact de la suspension sans solde de trois jours qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fenderesse dans les semaines qui ont suivi l\u2019Incident, laquelle d\u00e9montrerait que la d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019avait plus l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00eatre li\u00e9e par le contrat de travail; d\u2019autre part, il se serait m\u00e9pris sur le caract\u00e8re volontaire de sa lettre de d\u00e9mission de mai 2022.\n[8] Encore ici, le demandeur ne nous a pas convaincus qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019intervenir. Comme nous le lui avons expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable est une norme d\u00e9f\u00e9rente, m\u00eame lorsque le Conseil interpr\u00e8te le Code (Vavilov au para. 49; Payne c. Banque de Montr\u00e9al, 2013 CAF 33 aux para. 33, 81). Comme c\u2019est le cas du contr\u00f4le judiciaire des d\u00e9cisions de la plupart des tribunaux administratifs sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s en relations de travail au Canada, une d\u00e9f\u00e9rence consid\u00e9rable s\u2019impose ici \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision du Conseil est fortement domin\u00e9e par les faits et qu\u2019elle est du type de celles que le Conseil rend r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Alexis, 2021 CAF 216; Rouet c. Canada (Justice), 2023 CAF 50).\n[9] La norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable signifie que nous devons nous abstenir de reconsid\u00e9rer la d\u00e9cision du Conseil, r\u00e9\u00e9valuer la preuve, mettre en doute les conclusions tir\u00e9es par le Conseil et y substituer les n\u00f4tres (Vavilov au para. 83). Notre r\u00f4le consiste plut\u00f4t \u00e0 nous assurer, avec une \u00ab attention respectueuse \u00bb, que la d\u00e9cision du Conseil repose sur un raisonnement rationnel et logique et qu\u2019elle se situe, au niveau du r\u00e9sultat, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la fourchette des issues possibles et acceptables en regard des faits de l\u2019affaire et du droit applicable (Vavilov au para. 84; Dunsmuir c. Nouveau-Brunswick, 2008 CSC 9 au para. 47).\n[10] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, nous sommes d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision du Conseil poss\u00e8de les attributs de la raisonnabilit\u00e9 : le Conseil a bien identifi\u00e9 le test juridique \u00e0 deux volets applicable aux cas de cong\u00e9diements injustes entrepris en vertu du Code, fait une revue minutieuse de la preuve administr\u00e9e devant lui, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les arguments du demandeur, et tir\u00e9 les conclusions qui, selon lui, s\u2019imposaient en regard des faits mis en preuve et du droit qui leur \u00e9tait applicable. Ce faisant, il a appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des divers t\u00e9moignages qu\u2019il a entendus, une t\u00e2che qui est au c\u0153ur de son mandat et de son expertise. Sa d\u00e9cision est \u00e9toff\u00e9e, rationnelle, logique et support\u00e9e par la preuve. Dans une affaire ax\u00e9e sur les faits, le demandeur devait en faire davantage, pour que nous intervenions, que d\u2019exprimer de simples d\u00e9saccords avec la d\u00e9cision du Conseil.\n[11] Pour toutes ces raisons, la pr\u00e9sente demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire sera rejet\u00e9e. Comme la d\u00e9fenderesse ne les r\u00e9clame plus, elle le sera sans d\u00e9pens.\n\u00ab Ren\u00e9 LeBlanc \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\nA-271-22\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nYASSINE ESSA\u00cf c.

La seule question \u00e0 trancher en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est donc celle de savoir si la Section de l\u2019immigration (la SI) de la Commission de l\u2019immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 a raisonnablement conclu que l\u2019acte d\u2019espionnage en cause \u00e9tait \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR. La SI a fond\u00e9 sa conclusion d\u2019interdiction de territoire sur une interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) selon laquelle aucun lien entre l\u2019acte d\u2019espionnage en cause et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du Canada n\u2019\u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire.\n[3] Dans une d\u00e9cision publi\u00e9e sous la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence 2020 CF 631 (d\u00e9cision Weldemariam), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la SI \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable et que l\u2019expression \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb exige un lien avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.

Weldemariam, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a certifi\u00e9 la question suivante :\nUne personne est-elle interdite de territoire au Canada, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)f) de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s parce qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 membre d\u2019une organisation dont il y a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9, qu\u2019elle est ou qu\u2019elle sera l\u2019auteur d\u2019actes d\u2019espionnage \u00ab contraire[s] aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la Loi, si les activit\u00e9s d\u2019espionnage de cette organisation ont lieu en dehors du Canada et ciblent des ressortissants \u00e9trangers de fa\u00e7on contraire aux valeurs qui sous-tendent la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s et le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9mocratique du Canada, notamment les libert\u00e9s fondamentales garanties par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2b) de la Charte?\n[5] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a commis aucune erreur en concluant que la d\u00e9cision de la SI \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable et en concluant que l\u2019expression \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb exige un lien avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou la s\u00fbret\u00e9 du Canada. Je suis convaincue que la SI n\u2019a pas tenu compte des contraintes juridiques qui lui \u00e9taient impos\u00e9es par le droit international, notamment les dispositions relatives au non-refoulement pr\u00e9vues dans la Convention de 1951 relative au statut des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, R.T. Can. 1969 no 6 (la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s), de 1951, ainsi que les principes reconnus d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative.\n[6] Par cons\u00e9quent, je r\u00e9pondrais par la n\u00e9gative \u00e0 la question certifi\u00e9e et je rejetterais l\u2019appel.\nI. Contexte\n[7] M. Weldemariam est un citoyen \u00e9thiopien et un ancien employ\u00e9 de l\u2019Information Network Security Agency (l\u2019INSA), un service de renseignement et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00e9thiopien. M. Weldemariam a travaill\u00e9 pour l\u2019INSA \u00e0 titre de concepteur de logiciels o\u00f9, selon M. Weldemariam, il a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 la conception d\u2019un logiciel de simulation de d\u00e9fense a\u00e9rienne devant servir \u00e0 la formation de militaires.\n[8] M. Weldemariam a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019INSA jusqu\u2019au milieu de 2014, lorsqu\u2019il a quitt\u00e9 l\u2019\u00c9thiopie pour la Su\u00e8de afin de poursuivre des \u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures. Il est retourn\u00e9 en \u00c9thiopie en 2016, apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 ses \u00e9tudes. M. Weldemariam est arriv\u00e9 au Canada en 2017; il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019asile \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Il all\u00e9guait qu\u2019il courait un risque de pers\u00e9cution de la part des forces de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9thiopiennes, qui, selon M. Weldemariam, l\u2019avaient cibl\u00e9 apr\u00e8s son retour en \u00c9thiopie, apr\u00e8s son s\u00e9jour en Su\u00e8de.\n[9] La demande d\u2019asile de M. Weldemariam a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue pendant que le ministre examinait la question de savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait interdit de territoire au Canada en raison de son emploi au sein de l\u2019INSA. La SI a ensuite tenu une audience concernant l\u2019interdiction de territoire de M. Weldemariam.\nII. D\u00e9cision de la SI\n[10] Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 la SI dans sa d\u00e9cision (X (Re), 2019 CanLII 135483), M. Weldemariam avait reconnu que son emploi \u00e0 l\u2019INSA \u00e9tait suffisant pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il \u00e9tait membre d\u2019une organisation aux fins d\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)f) de la LIPR. Un \u00e9tranger est interdit de territoire pour raison de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 s\u2019il est \u00ab membre d\u2019une organisation dont il y a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019elle est, a \u00e9t\u00e9 ou sera l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte vis\u00e9 aux alin\u00e9as a) [\u2026] \u00bb.\n[11] Par cons\u00e9quent, les questions d\u00e9terminantes que devait trancher la SI \u00e9taient celles de savoir s\u2019il y avait des motifs raisonnables de croire que les activit\u00e9s de l\u2019INSA constituaient des actes d\u2019espionnage et, dans l\u2019affirmative, si ces activit\u00e9s \u00e9taient dirig\u00e9es \u00ab contre le Canada ou [\u00e9taient] contraire[s] aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb.\n[12] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mugesera c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), 2005 CSC 40, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9crit la norme de preuve des \u00ab motifs raisonnables [de croire] \u00bb comme exigeant \u00ab davantage qu\u2019un simple soup\u00e7on, mais [elle] rest[e] moins stricte que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s applicable en mati\u00e8re civile \u00bb. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mugesera, la Cour supr\u00eame a poursuivi en concluant que \u00ab [l]a croyance doit essentiellement poss\u00e9der un fondement objectif reposant sur des renseignements concluants et dignes de foi \u00bb : au para. 114.\n[13] La SI a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019il existait des motifs raisonnables de croire que l\u2019INSA avait recueilli secr\u00e8tement des renseignements aupr\u00e8s d\u2019employ\u00e9s de l\u2019Ethiopian Satellite Television (l\u2019ESAT) aux \u00c9tats-Unis et en Belgique. L\u2019ESAT est un m\u00e9dia ind\u00e9pendant d\u2019informations t\u00e9l\u00e9visuelles, radiophoniques et en ligne diffus\u00e9es par satellite qui est g\u00e9r\u00e9 par des membres de la diaspora \u00e9thiopienne dans de nombreux pays, dont les \u00c9tats-Unis et le Canada.\n[14] L\u2019INSA a recueilli des renseignements \u00e0 l\u2019aide de capacit\u00e9s cybern\u00e9tiques offensives et des logiciels malveillants de surveillance qui ciblaient des journalistes et des dissidents politiques. Au regard de ce fait, la SI \u00e9tait donc convaincue qu\u2019il y avait des motifs raisonnables de croire que l\u2019INSA avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019auteur d\u2019actes d\u2019\u00ab espionnage \u00bb au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR. Toutefois, la SI ne disposait d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve sugg\u00e9rant que M. Weldemariam avait particip\u00e9 personnellement aux activit\u00e9s d\u2019espionnage de l\u2019INSA, et la SI n\u2019a tir\u00e9 aucune conclusion \u00e0 cet effet.\n[15] Bien que l\u2019ESAT soit actif au Canada, la SI a conclu qu\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 produit pour montrer que l\u2019INSA avait d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 des logiciels de piratage ciblant des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ESAT au Canada ou qu\u2019elle avait par ailleurs cibl\u00e9 des journalistes de l\u2019ESAT au Canada. Par cons\u00e9quent, la SI a conclu que les actions de l\u2019INSA n\u2019\u00e9taient pas dirig\u00e9es \u00ab contre le Canada \u00bb. La question \u00e0 trancher \u00e9tait donc de savoir si les actions de l\u2019INSA \u00e9taient n\u00e9anmoins \u00ab contraire[s] aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR.\n[16] M\u00eame si les personnes cibl\u00e9es par l\u2019INSA se trouvaient \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada, la SI a conclu que les actes d\u2019espionnage de l\u2019INSA contre des journalistes \u00e9thiopiens et des dissidents politiques aux \u00c9tats\u2010Unis \u00e9taient \u00ab contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb, puisqu\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 commis \u00ab contre des ressortissants de pays alli\u00e9s du Canada \u00bb : au para. 34.\n[17] La SI a en outre conclu que \u00ab [l]es libert\u00e9s fondamentales d\u2019opinion et d\u2019expression, y compris la libert\u00e9 de la presse et d\u2019autres moyens de communication, constituent l\u2019une des pierres angulaires de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s \u00bb : au para. 34. Par cons\u00e9quent, la SI \u00e9tait convaincue que les actes d\u2019espionnage auxquels s\u2019\u00e9tait livr\u00e9e l\u2019INSA contre des membres de l\u2019ESAT \u00e9taient \u00ab contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR.\n[18] La SI a donc conclu que M. Weldemariam \u00e9tait interdit de territoire au Canada parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait membre d\u2019une organisation qui est l\u2019auteur d\u2019actes d\u2019espionnage contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada, au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR.\nIII. D\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\n[19] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019appartenance de M. Weldemariam \u00e0 l\u2019INSA n\u2019\u00e9tait plus en litige, pas plus que le fait que l\u2019INSA \u00e9tait l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte d\u2019espionnage. Il n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que les actes de l\u2019INSA \u00e9taient \u00ab contre le Canada \u00bb. Par cons\u00e9quent, la seule conclusion tir\u00e9e par la SI qui \u00e9tait en litige devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9tait sa d\u00e9cision selon laquelle les activit\u00e9s de l\u2019INSA \u00e9taient \u00ab contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb.\n[20] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que c\u2019est la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable qui s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 l\u2019examen de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la SA de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR. La Cour a conclu que la d\u00e9cision de la SI n\u2019\u00e9tait pas raisonnable, puisqu\u2019elle a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9raisonnablement large l\u2019expression \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb qui figure dans cette disposition. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la SI et a renvoy\u00e9 le dossier de M. Weldemariam \u00e0 la SI pour nouvel examen.\n[21] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que la d\u00e9cision de la SI \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable \u00e0 trois \u00e9gards. Premi\u00e8rement, la SI n\u2019avait pas tenu compte de l\u2019historique et de l\u2019objet de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a), qui d\u00e9montraient que la disposition avait \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite pour restreindre les d\u00e9cisions d\u2019interdiction de territoire pour des motifs li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019espionnage.\n[22] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la SI a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que les \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb s\u2019entendaient de [traduction] \u00ab ce qui int\u00e9resse le Canada \u00bb, en omettant le fait qu\u2019il doit exister un lien r\u00e9el avec le Canada pour d\u00e9clencher l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a).\n[23] Enfin, en se fondant sur sa d\u00e9cision intitul\u00e9e Mason c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2019 CF 1251, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que, dans le cas de M. Weldemariam, un lien avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour qu\u2019une affaire rel\u00e8ve de la port\u00e9e du paragraphe 34(1) de la LIPR. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement conclu que la SI n\u2019avait pas expliqu\u00e9 le lien entre les actions de l\u2019INSA et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du Canada.\n[24] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a reconnu que les activit\u00e9s d\u2019espionnage dirig\u00e9es contre les alli\u00e9s du Canada peuvent \u00eatre contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada et que le ciblage d\u2019un alli\u00e9 peut facilement \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme mettant en jeu la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du Canada. Toutefois, l\u2019INSA ne ciblait pas les \u00c9tats-Unis ou la Belgique, mais bien des particuliers qui r\u00e9sidaient simplement dans ces pays.\n[25] Selon la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, c\u2019est une chose d\u2019envisager que le ciblage d\u2019un pays alli\u00e9 met en jeu les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale, mais c\u2019est \u00ab tout autre chose \u00bb de sugg\u00e9rer que ces int\u00e9r\u00eats sont mis en jeu par le simple ciblage de particuliers qui sont ressortissants ou r\u00e9sidents d\u2019un pays alli\u00e9 du Canada. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que, \u00e0 tout le moins, la SI devait fournir une explication raisonnable du lien entre le ciblage de personnes dans d\u2019autres pays et les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale pour que la d\u00e9cision puisse r\u00e9sister \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la SI n\u2019a fourni aucune explication \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que sa d\u00e9cision manquait de justification, de transparence et d\u2019intelligibilit\u00e9, et la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de M. Weldemariam a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie.\nIV. Question en litige\n[26] Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, la seule question que doit trancher la Cour est celle de savoir si l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation par la SI de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR \u00e9tait raisonnable et s\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9tablir un lien entre les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou la s\u00fbret\u00e9 du Canada, et l\u2019expression \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb, pour conclure qu\u2019un acte d\u2019espionnage rel\u00e8ve de la port\u00e9e de cette disposition.\nV. Norme de contr\u00f4le\n[27] Dans le cas d\u2019un appel comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le r\u00f4le de notre Cour est de d\u00e9terminer si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a choisi la norme de contr\u00f4le appropri\u00e9e \u2013 celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte ou celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable \u2013 et si elle a correctement appliqu\u00e9 cette norme : Office r\u00e9gional de la sant\u00e9 du Nord c. Horrocks, 2021 CSC 42, aux paras. 10 \u00e0 12; Agraira c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2013 CSC 36, aux paras. 45 \u00e0 47. Ce r\u00f4le a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme exigeant que nous devons \u00ab nous mettre \u00e0 la place \u00bb du juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et qu\u2019elle mette l\u2019accent sur la d\u00e9cision administrative de l\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieure.\n[28] Notre Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 exprim\u00e9 ses r\u00e9serves concernant l\u2019application de la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable dans le contexte de questions certifi\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 74d) de la LIPR. C\u2019est particuli\u00e8rement vrai lorsque, comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, notre Cour est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des questions d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative qui exigent une r\u00e9ponse par oui ou par non : voir, par exemple, l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration) c. Galindo Camayo, 2022 CAF 50, aux paras. 40 \u00e0 44. Voir aussi l\u2019opinion dissidente de la juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2023 CSC 21, aux paras. 126 et 152 (arr\u00eat Mason). N\u00e9anmoins, la d\u00e9cision majoritaire dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason confirme que la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable est celle que les cours de r\u00e9vision doivent appliquer lorsqu\u2019elles examinent des questions certifi\u00e9es dans un contexte d\u2019immigration.\n[29] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019accord avec les parties pour dire que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a correctement choisi la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable comme \u00e9tant la norme \u00e0 appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019examen de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la SI de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l\u2019expression \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb qui figure dans cette disposition. La question \u00e0 trancher est donc celle de savoir si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a correctement appliqu\u00e9 cette norme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nVI. Remarque pr\u00e9liminaire\n[30] Avant de commencer mon analyse, il est important de souligner que ni la SI ni la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient des enseignements de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason qu\u2019elle a rendu r\u00e9cemment. Dans ce litige, la Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)e) de la LIPR, qui interdit de territoire au Canada tout r\u00e9sident permanent et \u00e9tranger qui est \u00ab l\u2019auteur de tout acte de violence susceptible de mettre en danger la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui au Canada \u00bb.\n[31] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason, la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait qu\u2019une seule interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)e) de la LIPR, \u00e0 savoir que cette disposition exige un lien avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou la s\u00fbret\u00e9 du Canada : pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 121.\n[32] Les r\u00e9percussions de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR et le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la compr\u00e9hension de la SI de ce que signifie un acte d\u2019espionnage qui est \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb sont contest\u00e9es et seront examin\u00e9s dans la prochaine section des pr\u00e9sents motifs.\nVII. Analyse\n[33] Les parties et les intervenants ont soulev\u00e9 des questions concernant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR. Il s\u2019agit notamment d\u2019arguments li\u00e9s au libell\u00e9, au contexte et \u00e0 l\u2019objet de la disposition, ainsi que des arguments fond\u00e9s sur le droit international. J\u2019aborderai d\u2019abord la question du droit international.\nA. Argument fond\u00e9 sur le droit international\n[34] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason, la Cour supr\u00eame nous a fortement rappel\u00e9 l\u2019importance du droit international en tant qu\u2019outil utile pour interpr\u00e9ter les lois nationales : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paras. 104 \u00e0 117. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour supr\u00eame a indiqu\u00e9 que, dans son arr\u00eat ant\u00e9rieur, Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65, elle avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le droit international peut imposer une contrainte importante aux d\u00e9cideurs administratifs en raison de la pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle la l\u00e9gislation nationale est r\u00e9put\u00e9e s\u2019appliquer conform\u00e9ment aux obligations internationales du Canada : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 105; arr\u00eat Vavilov, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 114.\n[35] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le ministre a fait valoir que les questions d\u00e9terminantes dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason \u00e9taient li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019omission par la Section d\u2019appel de l\u2019immigration (SAI) de la Commission de l\u2019immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 d\u2019examiner deux \u00ab \u00e9l\u00e9ments importants du contexte l\u00e9gislatif \u00bb. M. Mason avait soulev\u00e9 ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son affirmation selon laquelle, correctement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)e) de la LIPR requiert un lien avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou la s\u00fbret\u00e9 du Canada. La Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que l\u2019omission de la SAI d\u2019examiner ces arguments avait entra\u00een\u00e9 l\u2019absence d\u2019une justification adapt\u00e9e aux questions et pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es, ce qui avait amen\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e0 perdre confiance dans la d\u00e9cision de la SAI : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 10.\n[36] Le ministre semble donc sugg\u00e9rer que la discussion de la Cour supr\u00eame sur le droit international dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason constitue essentiellement des remarques incidentes.\n[37] Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord.\n[38] Il ressort clairement de l\u2019analyse aux paragraphes 104 \u00e0 117 des motifs de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason que le droit international a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le central dans l\u2019analyse de la Cour supr\u00eame. Au paragraphe 118 de ses motifs, la Cour supr\u00eame a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019omission de la SAI d\u2019examiner des arguments que M. Mason avait soulev\u00e9s dans ses observations \u00e9crites. Toutefois, dans le m\u00eame paragraphe, la Cour supr\u00eame a poursuivi en renvoyant \u00e0 l\u2019omission de la SAI d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter et d\u2019appliquer l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)e) conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de non-refoulement impos\u00e9e au Canada en vertu de la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s. La Cour supr\u00eame a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, \u00ab [c]umulativement, ces omissions ont rendu la d\u00e9cision de la SAI d\u00e9raisonnable \u00bb [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original].\n[39] Il ressort clairement de cet extrait que le droit international a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le central dans la conclusion de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason selon laquelle l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)e) par la SAI \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable et faisait partie de la justification de la d\u00e9cision.\n[40] Le ministre reconna\u00eet que les d\u00e9cideurs administratifs sont tenus de rendre des d\u00e9cisions conformes \u00e0 la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, partie I de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, annexe B, Loi de 1982 sur le Canada, 1982, ch. 11 (R.-U.) (la Charte), et aux obligations internationales du Canada en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Toutefois, il soutient que cela ne devrait pas imposer un fardeau suppl\u00e9mentaire aux d\u00e9cideurs selon lequel ces derniers seraient tenus d\u2019examiner des arguments que les parties n\u2019ont jamais soulev\u00e9s.\n[41] Cet argument ne peut tenir. Il n\u2019est pas loisible \u00e0 notre Cour de faire abstraction des directives explicites de la Cour supr\u00eame concernant l\u2019obligation des d\u00e9cideurs en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter et d\u2019appliquer la LIPR d\u2019une mani\u00e8re conforme aux instruments internationaux en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne dont le Canada est signataire : voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 104.\n[42] Le ministre a \u00e9galement fait valoir que le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la SI en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne devrait pas d\u00e9pendre de la question de savoir si la SI avait tenu compte du principe de non-refoulement. Selon le ministre, cela tient au fait que la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 est distincte du processus de renvoi, et que la conclusion de la SI selon laquelle M. Weldemariam est interdit de territoire au Canada ne le dirige pas vers un renvoi, de sorte que le principe de non-refoulement s\u2019appliquerait.\n[43] Toutefois, il en va de m\u00eame d\u2019une conclusion fond\u00e9e concernant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)e) de la LIPR. La Cour supr\u00eame estimait n\u00e9anmoins que les principes de droit international, y compris le principe de non-refoulement, devraient guider l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de cette disposition : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paras. 109 \u00e0 111.\n[44] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)e) de la LIPR devait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 33(2) de la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, qui cr\u00e9e une exception au principe de non-refoulement, permettant le renvoi de personnes qui constituent une menace pour la communaut\u00e9 du pays d\u2019accueil : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paras. 107 \u00e0 111.\n[45] L\u2019article premier de la Convention relative au statut des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s d\u00e9finit le \u00ab r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 \u00bb comme une personne \u00ab craignant avec raison d\u2019\u00eatre pers\u00e9cut\u00e9e du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalit\u00e9, de son appartenance \u00e0 un certain groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques \u00bb. Le paragraphe 33(1) de la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019\u00ab [a]ucun des \u00c9tats contractants n\u2019expulsera ou ne refoulera, de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit, un r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 sur les fronti\u00e8res des territoires o\u00f9 sa vie ou sa libert\u00e9 serait menac\u00e9e en raison de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalit\u00e9, de son appartenance \u00e0 un certain groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques \u00bb.\n[46] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9crit le principe du non-refoulement comme formant le \u00ab noyau \u00bb de la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et la \u00ab pierre angulaire du r\u00e9gime international de protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s \u00bb : pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paras. 107 et 108.\n[47] Toutefois, il existe une exception au principe du non-refoulement. En effet, le paragraphe 33(2) de la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s pr\u00e9voit que sa protection ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e par un r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 que s\u2019\u00ab il y a des raisons s\u00e9rieuses de consid\u00e9rer le r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 comme un danger pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du pays o\u00f9 il se trouve \u00bb. Le r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 qui, ayant \u00ab \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet d\u2019une condamnation d\u00e9finitive pour un crime ou d\u00e9lit particuli\u00e8rement grave et constitue une menace pour la communaut\u00e9 dudit pays \u00bb est \u00e9galement exclu de la protection de la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s.\n[48] Le ministre soutient que la LIPR pr\u00e9voit des mesures de protection qui pourraient \u00eatre mises en place ult\u00e9rieurement pour prot\u00e9ger M. Weldemariam contre un refoulement. Par cons\u00e9quent, il affirme qu\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) qui n\u2019exige aucun lien avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la d\u00e9termination de la recevabilit\u00e9 ne contreviendrait pas au paragraphe 33(2) de la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s.\n[49] Toutefois, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason, la Cour supr\u00eame a soigneusement \u00e9valu\u00e9 la capacit\u00e9 de possibles \u00ab soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb pour assurer le respect des obligations internationales du Canada en vertu de la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s. Ce faisant, la Cour supr\u00eame a examin\u00e9 la structure de la LIPR, y compris l\u2019interaction entre ses dispositions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019interdiction de territoire et les soi-disant soupapes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 disponibles dans le cadre du processus de renvoi.\n[50] La Cour supr\u00eame a express\u00e9ment rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument selon lequel les processus disponibles apr\u00e8s une conclusion d\u2019interdiction de territoire en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)e) offrent une protection ad\u00e9quate contre le refoulement. En effet, la Cour supr\u00eame a explicitement conclu qu\u2019aucun de ces processus n\u2019assurait le respect des obligations juridiques internationales du Canada en vertu de la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paras. 110 \u00e0 114. Ces processus sont semblables \u00e0 ceux dont M. Weldemariam pourrait se pr\u00e9valoir \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une conclusion d\u2019interdiction de territoire en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR.\n[51] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis convaincue que l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason de la Cour supr\u00eame exige que notre Cour tienne compte des obligations du Canada en vertu de la Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, en particulier du principe de non-refoulement, pour \u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la SI de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape du processus relatif \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de la recevabilit\u00e9.\n[52] Toutefois, avant d\u2019entreprendre cette \u00e9valuation, et par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers la SI, je dois souligner que l\u2019utilit\u00e9 du droit international \u00e0 titre d\u2019outil d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ne semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e devant la SI dans le dossier de M. Weldemariam. La Cour supr\u00eame a n\u00e9anmoins conclu, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason, que le principe de non-refoulement constitue une contrainte juridique essentielle \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la LIPR \u2013 dont le l\u00e9gislateur a oblig\u00e9 les d\u00e9cideurs en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration \u00e0 tenir compte dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la loi : LIPR, al. 3(2)b) et 3(3)f); arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paras. 85, 106, 117 et 118; B010 c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2015 CSC 58, au para. 49.\n[53] La Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s est donc d\u00e9terminante concernant la fa\u00e7on d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter la LIPR, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une intention contraire de la part du l\u00e9gislateur : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 106; de Guzman c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), 2005 CAF 436, au para. 87; arr\u00eat B010, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 49. Ni les parties ni les intervenants n\u2019ont relev\u00e9 de disposition l\u00e9gislative qui d\u00e9montrerait une intention contraire de la part du l\u00e9gislateur.\n[54] Le Canada a ratifi\u00e9 la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et le Protocole relatif au statut des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, R.T. Can. 1969 no 29. Ces instruments internationaux en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9clenchent la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation selon laquelle la l\u00e9gislation nationale est r\u00e9put\u00e9e s\u2019appliquer conform\u00e9ment au droit international : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 105; N\u00e9meth c. Canada (Justice), 2010 CSC 56, au para. 17.\n[55] Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9, le paragraphe 33(1) de la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s consacre l\u2019interdiction de refoulement, interdisant aux \u00c9tats contractants d\u2019expulser ou de refouler les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s vers des pays o\u00f9 leur vie ou leur libert\u00e9 serait menac\u00e9e en raison de leur race, de leur religion, de leur nationalit\u00e9, de leur appartenance \u00e0 un certain groupe social ou de leurs opinions politiques.\n[56] Encore une fois, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, le paragraphe 33(2) de la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s cr\u00e9e des exceptions limit\u00e9es au principe de non\u2010refoulement, qui permettent le refoulement des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s lorsqu\u2019il y a des motifs raisonnables de croire que la personne constitue une menace pour le pays d\u2019accueil ou qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un crime grave : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 109; Febles c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2014 CSC 68, au para. 25.\n[57] Par cons\u00e9quent, une conclusion d\u2019interdiction de territoire en vertu des alin\u00e9as 34(1)a) ou 34(1)e) de la LIPR peut effectivement priver une personne de l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux proc\u00e9dures et aux protections du Canada en mati\u00e8re d\u2019asile.\n[58] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason, la Cour supr\u00eame a soulign\u00e9 que, si l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)e) \u00e9tait interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme n\u2019exigeant aucun lien avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9, un \u00e9tranger pourrait \u00eatre expuls\u00e9 vers un pays o\u00f9 il serait pers\u00e9cut\u00e9 une fois qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu qu\u2019il est interdit de territoire en vertu de cette disposition. Cela pourrait se produire sans qu\u2019il ne soit jamais conclu que la personne constitue une menace pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du Canada ou qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un crime grave. Cela tient au fait que les exceptions pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 33(2) ne s\u2019appliqueraient pas : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 109.\n[59] La m\u00eame analyse s\u2019appliquerait en cas d\u2019interdiction de territoire au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR.\n[60] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la SI avait interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019expression \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb figurant \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) comme englobant un large \u00e9ventail d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada, y compris des activit\u00e9s contraires aux valeurs garanties par la Charte. Cette interpr\u00e9tation pourrait exposer des personnes \u00e0 de la pers\u00e9cution une fois celles-ci d\u00e9clar\u00e9es interdites de territoire en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) pour s\u2019\u00eatre livr\u00e9es \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada, sans qu\u2019il ne soit jamais conclu qu\u2019il y avait des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019elles constituaient une menace pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du Canada. Cela tient au fait que, selon cette interpr\u00e9tation, les exceptions pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 33(2) ne s\u2019appliqueraient pas.\n[61] En d\u2019autres termes, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la SI permettrait le refoulement de personnes interdites de territoire en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR dans des circonstances qui ne sont pas vis\u00e9es par les exceptions pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 33(2).\n[62] En revanche, une interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR qui exigerait un lien avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9 rendrait cette disposition conforme \u00e0 l\u2019article 33 de la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s. Selon cette interpr\u00e9tation, une personne d\u00e9clar\u00e9e interdite de territoire en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) parce qu\u2019elle s\u2019est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9 rel\u00e8verait de l\u2019exception de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au principe de non\u2010refoulement pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 33(2) : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 109. Cela aurait pour r\u00e9sultat qu\u2019une mesure de renvoi dans de tels cas ne violerait pas l\u2019obligation de non-refoulement du Canada : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 111.\n[63] Lorsqu\u2019on lui pr\u00e9sente deux interpr\u00e9tations contradictoires de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR \u2013 o\u00f9 l\u2019une est conforme aux exigences de l\u2019article 33 de la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et o\u00f9 l\u2019autre ne l\u2019est pas \u2013, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui serait conforme aux engagements internationaux du Canada, y compris ses obligations de non-refoulement, devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e.\n[64] Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason, l\u2019omission de la SI de tenir compte du r\u00f4le de la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s comme contrainte \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la LIPR n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une omission mineure, mais une omission essentielle \u2013 qui fait abstraction du principe de non-refoulement \u2013, la pierre angulaire m\u00eame du r\u00e9gime international de protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 108; arr\u00eat N\u00e9meth, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paras. 18 et 19. La SI n\u2019a donc pas tenu compte d\u2019une contrainte essentielle de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la LIPR \u2013 une contrainte que le l\u00e9gislateur a explicitement \u00e9nonc\u00e9e et qui doit \u00eatre prise en compte par les d\u00e9cideurs en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration lorsqu\u2019ils interpr\u00e8tent et appliquent la LIPR : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 117. Cela rend la d\u00e9cision de la SI en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9raisonnable.\n[65] Cette conclusion constitue un fondement suffisant pour confirmer la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019annuler la d\u00e9cision de la SI dans le dossier de M. Weldemariam. Toutefois, des arguments ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s par les parties et les intervenants concernant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a). Ces arguments seront pris en compte dans l\u2019examen de la question de savoir s\u2019il y a plus d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR.\nB. Autres principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative\n[66] Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame, les cours de r\u00e9vision doivent adopter une approche \u00ab s\u2019int\u00e9ress[ant] avant tout aux motifs de la d\u00e9cision \u00bb lorsqu\u2019elles r\u00e9visent des d\u00e9cisions administratives. En d\u2019autres termes, la cour de r\u00e9vision doit d\u2019abord examiner les motifs fournis par le d\u00e9cideur administratif, lui accorder \u00ab une attention respectueuse \u00bb et chercher \u00e0 \u00ab comprendre le fil du raisonnement suivi par le d\u00e9cideur pour en arriver \u00e0 sa conclusion \u00bb : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 60; arr\u00eat Vavilov, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 84; Dunsmuir c. Nouveau-Brunswick, 2008 CSC 9, au para. 48.\n[67] La Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision raisonnable est \u00ab fond\u00e9e sur une analyse intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rente et rationnelle [qui] est justifi\u00e9e au regard des contraintes juridiques et factuelles auxquelles le d\u00e9cideur est assujetti \u00bb : arr\u00eat Vavilov, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 85.\n[68] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation faite par la SI de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) \u00e9tait largement fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Agraira, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, de la Cour supr\u00eame, qui concernait une version ant\u00e9rieure de la disposition relative \u00e0 la dispense minist\u00e9rielle dans la LIPR, et sur le chapitre ENF 2\/OP 18, \u00c9valuation de l\u2019interdiction de territoire, du guide op\u00e9rationnel de Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration Canada (CIC). Le guide op\u00e9rationnel dresse une liste non exhaustive d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments qui, selon CIC, peuvent constituer un acte d\u2019espionnage contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada.\n[69] En ce qui concerne le fait que la SI se soit appuy\u00e9e sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Agraira, la SI a conclu que les commentaires de la Cour supr\u00eame dans cet arr\u00eat au sujet du sens de l\u2019expression \u00ab contraire \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat national \u00bb, figurant au paragraphe 34(2) de la LIPR, \u00e9taient utiles pour d\u00e9finir les \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019interdiction de territoire en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a).\n[70] Le paragraphe 34(2) (qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9 en 2013) pr\u00e9voyait que le ministre pouvait exempter une personne d\u2019une conclusion d\u2019interdiction de territoire si cette personne \u00e9tait en mesure de convaincre le ministre \u00ab que sa pr\u00e9sence au Canada [ne serait] nullement pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat national \u00bb.\n[71] Renvoyant largement au paragraphe 65 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Agraira, la SI a soulign\u00e9 que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019expression \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eat national \u00bb renvoie \u00e0 des questions qui int\u00e9ressent le Canada et les Canadiens. Bien que cela inclue la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale, le libell\u00e9 clair de la disposition favorisait une interpr\u00e9tation plus large et le fait que l\u2019expression \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eat national \u00bb comprenne aussi la pr\u00e9servation des valeurs sous-jacentes \u00e0 la Charte et au caract\u00e8re d\u00e9mocratique du Canada. La SI a conclu que les actes d\u2019espionnage commis par l\u2019INSA contre des membres de l\u2019ESAT, une organisation m\u00e9diatique, \u00e9taient contraires \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 de la presse et d\u2019autres moyens de communication m\u00e9diatiques, qui est une pierre angulaire de la Charte.\n[72] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9 que la Charte ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 l\u2019INSA et qu\u2019elle ne prot\u00e8ge pas les journalistes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9s par l\u2019INSA. Bien que l\u2019ESAT soit actif au Canada, la SI n\u2019a tir\u00e9 aucune conclusion concernant les r\u00e9percussions \u00e9ventuelles des actions de l\u2019INSA sur les activit\u00e9s de l\u2019ESAT au Canada. S\u2019il n\u2019y a pas au moins quelques explications en ce qui concerne les r\u00e9percussions, sur ces activit\u00e9s, du ciblage que l\u2019INSA a men\u00e9 sur des particuliers dans d\u2019autres pays (en supposant qu\u2019il y ait eu des r\u00e9percussions), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait \u00ab d\u2019une base assez solide pour \u00e9tayer raisonnablement une conclusion selon laquelle les actions de l\u2019INSA \u00e9taient contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb : d\u00e9cision Weldemariam, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au para. 53.\n[73] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement conclu que la SI avait aussi eu tort de s\u2019appuyer sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Agraira. L\u2019une des raisons \u00e0 cela est qu\u2019elle a soulev\u00e9 la question de savoir s\u2019il est appropri\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer un crit\u00e8re ayant un objectif \u2013 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire d\u00e9cider si une personne peut \u00eatre exempt\u00e9e en ce qui concerne un motif d\u2019interdiction de territoire \u2013 pour interpr\u00e9ter une disposition qui a un objectif totalement diff\u00e9rent \u2013 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire d\u00e9cider si une personne est interdite de territoire : d\u00e9cision Weldemariam, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au para. 58.\n[74] La SI a \u00e9galement signal\u00e9 que le guide op\u00e9rationnel de CIC indiquait que les activit\u00e9s d\u2019espionnage \u00ab contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb comprenaient l\u2019utilisation du territoire canadien pour mener des activit\u00e9s d\u2019espionnage et les activit\u00e9s d\u2019espionnage r\u00e9alis\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada qui auraient une incidence n\u00e9gative sur la s\u00fbret\u00e9, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou la prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 du Canada. L\u2019expression \u00ab prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 du Canada \u00bb visait notamment des facteurs financiers, \u00e9conomiques, sociaux et culturels. Les activit\u00e9s d\u2019espionnage ne doivent pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre dirig\u00e9es contre l\u2019\u00c9tat, mais elles peuvent aussi \u00ab \u00eatre contre des int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux ou autres int\u00e9r\u00eats priv\u00e9s canadiens \u00bb. Selon le guide, les activit\u00e9s dirig\u00e9es contre des alli\u00e9s du Canada peuvent \u00e9galement \u00eatre contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada.\n[75] Comme la Cour supr\u00eame l\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait remarquer, des lignes directrices comme celles qui figurent dans les manuels de politiques de CIC constituent un indicateur utile de ce qui constitue une interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable d\u2019une disposition donn\u00e9e de la LIPR : Kanthasamy c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2015 CSC 61, au para. 32. Cela dit, les manuels de politiques de CIC ne lient pas juridiquement notre Cour : Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration) c. Kassab, 2020 CAF 10, au para. 42.\n[76] L\u2019arr\u00eat Mason indique que les d\u00e9cideurs administratifs n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation formaliste de la loi dans tous les cas, comme on pourrait s\u2019y attendre de la part de cours de justice. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives par les d\u00e9cideurs administratifs doit toutefois \u00eatre conforme au principe moderne d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative, laquelle est ax\u00e9e sur le texte, le contexte et l\u2019objet de la disposition en question. En d\u2019autres termes, les d\u00e9cideurs administratifs doivent d\u00e9montrer dans leurs motifs qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient conscients de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 69; arr\u00eat Vavilov, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paras. 119 et 120.\n[77] M\u00eame si le d\u00e9cideur administratif n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 express\u00e9ment le sens d\u2019une disposition applicable, la cour de r\u00e9vision peut \u00eatre en mesure de discerner l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du dossier et se prononcer sur le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de cette interpr\u00e9tation : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 69; arr\u00eat Vavilov, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 123.\n[78] La question centrale est de savoir si l\u2019analyse manquante \u00ab am\u00e8ne la cour de r\u00e9vision \u00e0 perdre confiance dans le r\u00e9sultat auquel est arriv\u00e9 le d\u00e9cideur \u00bb : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 69; arr\u00eat Vavilov, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 122.\n[79] J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 examin\u00e9 l\u2019omission de la SI de tenir compte des contraintes impos\u00e9es par la disposition de non-refoulement de la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s dans son interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR. La question \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse est de savoir si l\u2019omission de la SI de tenir compte d\u2019autres principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative entra\u00eene une perte de confiance suppl\u00e9mentaire dans la d\u00e9cision de la SI.\n[80] Lorsqu\u2019elle proc\u00e8de \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable, la cour de r\u00e9vision doit tenir compte des cons\u00e9quences de la d\u00e9cision en cause sur les droits et les int\u00e9r\u00eats des personnes concern\u00e9es : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 81; arr\u00eat Vavilov, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 133. En d\u2019autres termes, lorsqu\u2019une d\u00e9cision a des cons\u00e9quences particuli\u00e8rement s\u00e9v\u00e8res pour une personne concern\u00e9e, le principe de la \u00ab justification adapt\u00e9e aux questions et pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es \u00bb exige que le d\u00e9cideur explique pourquoi sa d\u00e9cision refl\u00e8te le mieux l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 76; arr\u00eat Vavilov, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 133.\n[81] Les int\u00e9r\u00eats en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont importants : la conclusion d\u2019interdiction de territoire de la SI a pour r\u00e9sultat de renvoyer M. Weldemariam dans un pays o\u00f9 il risque d\u2019\u00eatre victime de pers\u00e9cution. Les motifs de la SI devaient donc refl\u00e9ter ce qui \u00e9tait en jeu : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paras. 76 et 81.\n[82] En plus de ne pas tenir compte de l\u2019importante contrainte juridique impos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) par l\u2019exigence selon laquelle la LIPR doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux obligations internationales du Canada, la SI a \u00e9galement omis de tenir compte de plusieurs techniques reconnues d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative.\n[83] Le libell\u00e9 en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce figure aux alin\u00e9as 34(1)a) et f) de la LIPR. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, ces dispositions ont pour effet d\u2019interdire de territoire au Canada, pour raison de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, les r\u00e9sidents permanents et les \u00e9trangers qui sont membres d\u2019une organisation dont il y a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019elle est, a \u00e9t\u00e9 ou sera l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte d\u2019espionnage \u00ab contre le Canada ou contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb.\n[84] Lorsque le libell\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative est pr\u00e9cis et non \u00e9quivoque, le sens ordinaire des mots joue un r\u00f4le pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant dans le processus d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation : Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco Canada c. Canada, 2005 CSC 54, au para. 10. Toutefois, lorsque les mots utilis\u00e9s dans une disposition l\u00e9gislative peuvent avoir plus d\u2019un sens raisonnable, leur sens ordinaire joue un r\u00f4le moins important dans l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative.\n[85] Personne ne conteste que l\u2019expression \u00ab contre le Canada \u00bb dans la premi\u00e8re partie de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) renvoie aux actes d\u2019espionnage dirig\u00e9s contre le Canada.\n[86] L\u2019expression \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb n\u2019est pas d\u00e9finie dans la section 4 de la LIPR, qui est la section r\u00e9gissant les interdictions de territoire, et, comme il est \u00e9vident en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il y a un d\u00e9bat sur sa port\u00e9e. La question est de savoir si l\u2019expression \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb renvoie \u00e0 un large \u00e9ventail de questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le Canada, y compris le respect des valeurs de la Charte et la pr\u00e9servation du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9mocratique du Canada (comme l\u2019a conclu la SI et comme le soutient le ministre), ou si elle se limite aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9 (comme le soutient M. Weldemariam).\n[87] Le ministre soutient que, m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait accept\u00e9 que l\u2019inclusion du terme \u00ab S\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb comme sous-titre du paragraphe 34(1) est indicateur du fait que chaque disposition de ce paragraphe porte sur des questions de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale, cela ne signifie pas que tout acte d\u2019espionnage qui est \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb doive \u00e9galement avoir des r\u00e9percussions particuli\u00e8res sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale. Selon le ministre, c\u2019est d\u2019autant plus vrai compte tenu du fait que le renvoi aux actes d\u2019espionnage \u00ab contre le Canada \u00bb \u00e9tablit d\u00e9j\u00e0 ce lien direct avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale.\n[88] Le ministre soutient que, si le l\u00e9gislateur avait voulu que l\u2019expression \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb figurant \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) exige un lien direct avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9, il aurait facilement pu le pr\u00e9ciser dans la disposition en interdisant tout acte d\u2019espionnage, non seulement ceux \u00ab contre le Canada \u00bb, comme il l\u2019a fait, mais aussi les actes d\u2019espionnage qui sont contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale. Toutefois, ce n\u2019est pas ce qu\u2019a fait le l\u00e9gislateur.\n[89] Le ministre soutient en outre que l\u2019utilisation du mot disjonctif \u00ab ou \u00bb dans l\u2019expression \u00ab contre le Canada ou contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original] sugg\u00e8re que l\u2019expression \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb n\u2019exige aucun lien avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale, et que les deux expressions devraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme distinctes.\n[90] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, le ministre soutient que l\u2019expression \u00ab contre le Canada \u00bb renvoie d\u00e9j\u00e0 aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale et qu\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019expression \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb selon laquelle il est \u00e9galement n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9tablir un lien avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale rendrait les mots de la disposition superflus et redondants, et irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019absence de tautologie.\n[91] Le ministre soutient que, puisque les personnes dont les actes d\u2019espionnage visent le Canada sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 interdites de territoire, l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur ne pouvait pas \u00eatre de renvoyer aux actes d\u2019espionnage \u00ab contraire[s] aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb comme correspondant au m\u00eame type d\u2019activit\u00e9. Outre les probl\u00e8mes mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, une telle interpr\u00e9tation serait \u00e9galement contraire \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle une expression a toujours le m\u00eame sens.\n[92] La lacune dans l\u2019argument du ministre est, bien s\u00fbr, que les expressions \u00ab contre le Canada \u00bb et \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb n\u2019ont pas le m\u00eame sens. Les actes d\u2019espionnage \u00ab contre le Canada \u00bb renvoient clairement aux actes d\u2019espionnage qui ciblent le Canada, tandis que les actes d\u2019espionnage qui sont \u00ab contraire[s] aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb renvoie aux actes d\u2019espionnage qui ne ciblent peut-\u00eatre pas le Canada en soi, mais qui sont n\u00e9anmoins contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du pays en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9. C\u2019est la nature et la port\u00e9e de ces int\u00e9r\u00eats qui sont en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[93] Pour trancher cette question, il est important de lire l\u2019expression \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb en tenant compte du reste du paragraphe 34(1) et du contexte plus large de la section 4 de la LIPR, qui est la partie de la LIPR qui concerne l\u2019interdiction de territoire au Canada. Ce faisant, il est clair que l\u2019expression \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb figurant \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) renvoie aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, et non \u00e0 un large \u00e9ventail de questions susceptibles d\u2019int\u00e9resser le Canada, comme le soutient le ministre.\n[94] Selon la section 4 de la LIPR, les r\u00e9sidents permanents et les \u00e9trangers sont interdits de territoire au Canada pour divers motifs, qui comprennent l\u2019atteinte aux droits humains ou internationaux (article 35), la grande criminalit\u00e9 (article 36), les activit\u00e9s de criminalit\u00e9 organis\u00e9e (article 37) et les fausses d\u00e9clarations (article 40).\n[95] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, le sous-titre du paragraphe 34 indique que ce paragraphe porte sur l\u2019interdiction de territoire pour raison de \u00ab S\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]. Cela sugg\u00e8re que les int\u00e9r\u00eats canadiens en jeu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) sont les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9.\n[96] Je reconnais que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 14 de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, L.R.C. (1985), ch. I-21, les notes marginales et les sous-titres ne font pas partie de la loi et n\u2019y figurent qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de rep\u00e8re ou d\u2019information. Cela dit, il est n\u00e9anmoins permis de les consid\u00e9rer comme faisant partie du processus d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, bien qu\u2019on puisse leur accorder un poids inf\u00e9rieur qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u2019autres outils d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation : Corbett c. Canada, [1997] 1 CF 386 (C.A.F.), 1996 CanLII 3849, au para. 13.\n[97] Le fait que les int\u00e9r\u00eats en jeu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) soient compris comme \u00e9tant les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 par le sous-titre du paragraphe 34(1). Il y est indiqu\u00e9 que les r\u00e9sidents permanents et les \u00e9trangers sont \u00ab interdi[ts] de territoire pour raison de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original] pour avoir commis divers actes, y compris les actes d\u2019espionnage et l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 des organisations qui sont l\u2019auteur d\u2019actes d\u2019espionnage. Encore une fois, cela sugg\u00e8re que l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e9tait de d\u00e9signer les int\u00e9r\u00eats canadiens dans cette disposition comme \u00e9tant les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9.\n[98] En plus des actes d\u2019espionnage, les r\u00e9sidents permanents et les \u00e9trangers peuvent \u00eatre interdits de territoire au Canada en vertu du paragraphe 34(1) pour avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des actes visant \u00e0 renverser un gouvernement par la force, s\u2019\u00eatre livr\u00e9s au terrorisme, constituer un danger pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du Canada ou s\u2019\u00eatre livr\u00e9s \u00e0 des actes de violence susceptibles de mettre en danger la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui au Canada. On peut aussi interdire de territoire au Canada toute personne membre d\u2019une organisation dont il y a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019elle est, a \u00e9t\u00e9 ou sera l\u2019auteur d\u2019un de ces actes.\n[99] Le fait que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) figure parmi d\u2019autres motifs li\u00e9s \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au paragraphe 34(1), \u00ab qui pr\u00e9sentent tous un lien avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du Canada \u00bb, est r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 121. Cet emplacement restreint davantage l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR.\n[100] D\u2019autres dispositions de la LIPR restreignent l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) et n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en compte par la SI. Les crit\u00e8res qui entrent en jeu lorsque le ministre effectue un examen des risques avant renvoi (ERAR) en sont un exemple. L\u2019ERAR est un processus par lequel une personne vis\u00e9e par une mesure de renvoi peut demander la protection du ministre, ce qui a pour effet de conf\u00e9rer l\u2019asile ou de surseoir \u00e0 la mesure de renvoi : voir la LIPR, art. 112 et au para. 114(1).\n[101] Comme l\u2019a fait observer la Cour supr\u00eame au paragraphe 93 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason, le ministre doit habituellement tenir compte, dans le cadre d\u2019une demande d\u2019ERAR, du risque qu\u2019un demandeur d\u2019ERAR serait expos\u00e9 \u00e0 la torture, \u00e0 une menace \u00e0 sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou de peines cruels et inusit\u00e9s.\n[102] Toutefois, le processus d\u2019ERAR pour les personnes d\u00e9clar\u00e9es interdites de territoire pour raison de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au titre du paragraphe 34(1) de la LIPR ne permet pas de d\u00e9terminer si elles satisfont aux crit\u00e8res de protection pr\u00e9vus dans la Convention relative aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s. Toutefois, le ministre doit se demander si \u00ab la demande devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e en raison de la nature et de la gravit\u00e9 de ses actes pass\u00e9s ou du danger qu\u2019il constitue pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du Canada \u00bb [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original] : LIPR, sous-al. 113d)(ii).\n[103] Cette distinction \u00e9taye la th\u00e8se selon laquelle le motif li\u00e9 \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au titre du paragraphe 34(1) de la LIPR exige un lien avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou la s\u00fbret\u00e9 du Canada.\n[104] La SI n\u2019a utilis\u00e9 aucun de ces outils d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation pour conclure qu\u2019il faut donner une interpr\u00e9tation large \u00e0 l\u2019expression \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire une interpr\u00e9tation qui n\u2019exige aucun lien avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du Canada ou ses int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Bien que, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, les d\u00e9cideurs administratifs n\u2019aient pas toujours \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative comme le ferait une cour de justice, leur interpr\u00e9tation de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives doit \u00eatre conforme au principe moderne d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative, qui met l\u2019accent sur le libell\u00e9, le contexte et l\u2019objet de la disposition en question. En d\u2019autres termes, les d\u00e9cideurs administratifs doivent d\u00e9montrer dans leurs motifs qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient conscients de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 69; arr\u00eat Vavilov, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paras. 119 et 120. L\u2019omission de la SI de le faire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce indique que son interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) n\u2019avait pas le degr\u00e9 de justification requis pour \u00eatre une d\u00e9cision raisonnable.\n[105] L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019expression \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb figurant \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) selon laquelle un lien avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9 est n\u00e9cessaire est \u00e9galement conforme \u00e0 l\u2019objet de la disposition.\n[106] La version actuelle de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) est entr\u00e9e en vigueur le 19 juin 2013 : Loi acc\u00e9l\u00e9rant le renvoi de criminels \u00e9trangers, L.C. 2013, ch. 16, art. 13 (projet de loi C-43). Avant 2013, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) pr\u00e9voyait que les r\u00e9sidents permanents et les \u00e9trangers \u00e9taient interdits de territoire pour raison de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 s\u2019ils \u00e9taient auteurs d\u2019actes \u00ab d\u2019espionnage ou se livr[aient] \u00e0 la subversion contre toute institution d\u00e9mocratique, au sens o\u00f9 cette expression s\u2019entend au Canada \u00bb.\n[107] Par suite des modifications apport\u00e9es en 2013, le fait d\u2019\u00eatre l\u2019auteur d\u2019actes d\u2019espionnage et le fait de se livrer \u00e0 la subversion sont devenus deux motifs distincts d\u2019interdiction de territoire; le fait de se livrer \u00e0 la subversion est maintenant vis\u00e9 aux alin\u00e9as 34(1)b) et b.1) de la LIPR. Auparavant, les actes d\u2019espionnage et la subversion devaient \u00eatre commis contre \u00ab toute institution d\u00e9mocratique, au sens o\u00f9 cette expression s\u2019entend au Canada \u00bb, tandis que maintenant, les deux types d\u2019actes sont limit\u00e9s par diff\u00e9rentes exigences : d\u00e9cision Weldemariam, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au para. 46.\n[108] Les actes d\u2019espionnage doivent maintenant \u00eatre commis contre le Canada ou \u00eatre contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada, tandis qu\u2019une personne peut \u00eatre interdite de territoire pour \u00eatre l\u2019instigateur ou l\u2019auteur d\u2019actes visant au renversement \u00ab d\u2019un gouvernement \u00bb par la force ou s\u2019\u00eatre livr\u00e9e \u00e0 la subversion contre \u00ab toute institution d\u00e9mocratique, au sens o\u00f9 cette expression s\u2019entend au Canada \u00bb.\n[109] La comparaison du libell\u00e9 des dispositions actuelles et du libell\u00e9 des dispositions qu\u2019elles remplacent d\u00e9montre que la port\u00e9e du terme \u00ab espionnage \u00bb comme motif d\u2019interdiction de territoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 restreinte en 2013. En vertu de la version ant\u00e9rieure de la LIPR, il suffisait que l\u2019acte d\u2019espionnage soit dirig\u00e9 contre \u00ab toute institution d\u00e9mocratique, au sens o\u00f9 cette expression s\u2019entend au Canada \u00bb, tandis que maintenant, les actes d\u2019espionnage doivent \u00eatre commis contre le Canada ou \u00eatre \u00ab contraire[s] aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb pour qu\u2019une personne soit interdite de territoire au Canada.\n[110] Pour conclure que les modifications apport\u00e9es au paragraphe 34 de la LIPR en 2013 visaient \u00e0 restreindre l\u2019application de la disposition relative \u00e0 l\u2019espionnage, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a tenu compte des commentaires formul\u00e9s par le ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9, de l\u2019Immigration et du Multiculturalisme de l\u2019\u00e9poque. En d\u2019autres termes, lors de la premi\u00e8re lecture du projet de loi C\u201143, l\u2019honorable Jason Kenney a expliqu\u00e9 que la modification du libell\u00e9 de la disposition relative \u00e0 l\u2019espionnage visait \u00ab \u00e0 restreindre la port\u00e9e de la disposition relative \u00e0 l\u2019interdiction de territoire pour motif d\u2019espionnage pour viser essentiellement les actes d\u2019espionnage contre le Canada ou ses int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00bb [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original].\n[111] Le ministre Kenney a soulign\u00e9 le fait que le libell\u00e9 de la version ant\u00e9rieure de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) \u00e9tait \u00ab inutilement vague \u00bb et pourrait englober des \u00ab personnes qui se livrent \u00e0 l\u2019espionnage pour le compte de proches alli\u00e9s d\u00e9mocratiques du Canada et qui recueillent peut-\u00eatre en fait des renseignements au nom de notre pays concernant des menaces communes \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb. Selon le ministre, il \u00e9tait donc pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable \u00ab que l\u2019interdiction de territoire associ\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019espionnage devrait s\u2019appliquer aux personnes qui commettent des actes d\u2019espionnage qui sont contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb : d\u00e9cision Weldemariam, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au para. 47, citant Canada, Parlement, D\u00e9bats de la Chambre des communes, 41e l\u00e9g., 1re session, vol. 146, no 151 (24 septembre 2012), p. 10327.\n[112] Des organismes comme la National Security Agency (la NSA) aux \u00c9tats-Unis et le Government Communications Headquarters (le GCHQ) au Royaume-Uni recueillent des renseignements au nom du Canada concernant les menaces communes \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Ces activit\u00e9s pourraient \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es comme des actes d\u2019espionnage \u00ab contre toute institution d\u00e9mocratique, au sens o\u00f9 cette expression s\u2019entend au Canada \u00bb et pourraient donc \u00eatre vis\u00e9es par la version ant\u00e9rieure de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a). Par cons\u00e9quent, la port\u00e9e de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) a \u00e9t\u00e9 restreinte en 2013 afin d\u2019\u00e9viter que des agents d\u2019organismes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 alli\u00e9s soient jug\u00e9s interdits de territoires pour des actes d\u2019espionnage qui pourraient n\u00e9anmoins \u00eatre dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du Canada.\n[113] Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation large qu\u2019a donn\u00e9 la SI \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR pourrait potentiellement prot\u00e9ger les personnes travaillant pour des organismes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 alli\u00e9s comme la NSA ou le GCHQ. Ces personnes pourraient, par exemple, se livrer \u00e0 des actes d\u2019espionnage d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui est contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en ce qui concerne des questions telles que le respect des valeurs de la Charte, mais qui ne serait pas contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9. La SI n\u2019a jamais examin\u00e9 la question de savoir si son interpr\u00e9tation large de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) \u00e9tait compatible avec l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur de restreindre la port\u00e9e de ce motif d\u2019interdiction de territoire : d\u00e9cision Weldemariam, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au para. 50.\n[114] L\u2019omission de la SI de tenir compte de ces principes suppl\u00e9mentaires d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative nous fournit d\u2019autres motifs susceptibles de miner notre confiance en ce qui concerne l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la SI de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR.\nVIII. Y a-t-il plus d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR?\n[115] Comme l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason, \u00ab le tribunal qui proc\u00e8de au contr\u00f4le d\u2019une d\u00e9cision selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable peut conclure que \u201cl\u2019interaction du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet ouvre la porte \u00e0 une seule interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable de la disposition l\u00e9gislative en cause ou de l\u2019aspect contest\u00e9 de celle-ci\u201d \u00bb : pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 71, et voir aussi le para. 120; arr\u00eat Vavilov, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 124.\n[116] \u00c0 mon avis, c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[117] Je reconnais que, comme l\u2019a soutenu le ministre, il existe certaines contraintes relatives \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui soutiendraient l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation par la SI de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR. Toutefois, il existe des contraintes juridiques et des principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative essentiels que la SI n\u2019a pas pris en compte et qui m\u00e8nent \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation contraire. Il s\u2019agit notamment des contraintes impos\u00e9es \u00e0 la SI par le droit international et les principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments soutiennent tr\u00e8s largement la conclusion selon laquelle il n\u2019existe qu\u2019une seule interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a).\n[118] En d\u2019autres termes, les r\u00e9sidents permanents et les \u00e9trangers ne peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9s interdits de territoire au Canada en vertu des alin\u00e9as 34(1)a) et 34(1)f) de la LIPR que si les actes d\u2019espionnage auxquels ils participent, directement ou indirectement, visent le Canada ou ont un lien avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9 : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 121.\n[119] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y a qu\u2019une seule interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable de la partie contest\u00e9e de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a), il s\u2019ensuit que la d\u00e9cision de la SI \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable et qu\u2019elle devrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9e.\n[120] La question suivante \u00e0 trancher est celle de savoir si le dossier de M. Weldemariam devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la SI pour nouvel examen.\nIX. Le dossier de M. Weldemariam devrait-il \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la SI pour nouvel examen?\n[121] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason, la Cour supr\u00eame a fait remarquer que, lorsque la cour de r\u00e9vision conclut qu\u2019il n\u2019y a qu\u2019une seule interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative, elle peut conclure que renvoyer la question au d\u00e9cideur administratif pour qu\u2019il rende une nouvelle d\u00e9cision ne servirait \u00e0 rien : arr\u00eat Mason, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paras. 71 et 120; arr\u00eat Vavilov, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au para. 124.\n[122] Les activit\u00e9s d\u2019espionnage de l\u2019INSA ont eu lieu \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada et ne touchaient aucunement le Canada. En effet, la SI a conclu que le seul lien avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00e9tait que l\u2019INSA s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00ab livr\u00e9e \u00e0 des actes d\u2019espionnage contre des ressortissants de pays alli\u00e9s du Canada \u00bb.\n[123] En effet, la SI ne disposait d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e9tablissant de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive que les journalistes et les dissidents politiques cibl\u00e9s par l\u2019INSA \u00e9taient des ressortissants des \u00c9tats\u2011Unis ou de la Belgique. M\u00eame si c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, l\u2019INSA ne ciblait pas les \u00c9tats-Unis ou la Belgique, ce qui aurait pu \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme mettant en jeu la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du Canada. L\u2019INSA ciblait des particuliers qui r\u00e9sidaient dans ces pays.\n[124] Comme l\u2019a signal\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, c\u2019est une chose \u00ab d\u2019envisager que le ciblage d\u2019un pays alli\u00e9 mette en jeu les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale, mais c\u2019est tout autre chose de laisser entendre que ces int\u00e9r\u00eats sont mis en jeu par le simple ciblage de particuliers qui sont ressortissants ou r\u00e9sidents d\u2019un pays alli\u00e9 du Canada \u00bb : d\u00e9cision Weldemariam, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au para. 74.\n[125] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a en outre soulign\u00e9 que, \u00ab [p]our que la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9siste \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le, il faut au moins une explication raisonnable quant au lien entre ce ciblage et les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale \u00bb : d\u00e9cision Weldemariam, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au para. 74. Aucune explication semblable n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[126] Bien que l\u2019ESAT soit active au Canada, rien n\u2019indique que les journalistes de l\u2019ESAT qui sont cibl\u00e9s r\u00e9sident dans ce pays. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont disposait la SI ne sugg\u00e9raient pas non plus que les actes de l\u2019INSA ciblaient le Canada en tant qu\u2019\u00c9tat, des entreprises canadiennes, des institutions canadiennes ou des particuliers canadiens, y compris des membres de la diaspora \u00e9thiopienne. Il n\u2019y avait pas non plus d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve affirmant que les actes de l\u2019INSA mettaient en jeu, de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit, les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9. Ces actes n\u2019\u00e9taient donc pas vis\u00e9s par l\u2019expression \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR.\n[127] Il n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que M. Weldemariam \u00e9tait membre d\u2019une organisation qui \u00e9tait l\u2019auteur d\u2019actes d\u2019espionnage dirig\u00e9s contre le Canada ou qui avait un lien avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale ou la s\u00fbret\u00e9 du Canada. Par cons\u00e9quent, les alin\u00e9as 34(1)a) et 34(1)f) de la LIPR ne fournissent aucun fondement juridique \u00e0 la conclusion d\u2019interdiction de territoire \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Weldemariam. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le ministre n\u2019a invoqu\u00e9 aucun autre motif justifiant l\u2019interdiction de territoire de M. Weldemariam, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de renvoyer le dossier \u00e0 la SI pour nouvel examen.\nX. Conclusion\n[128] Pour les pr\u00e9sents motifs, je conclus que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a commis aucune erreur en concluant que la d\u00e9cision de la SI \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable. Je r\u00e9pondrais par la n\u00e9gative \u00e0 la question certifi\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et je rejetterais l\u2019appel du ministre.\n\u00ab Anne L.

Ces dispositions pr\u00e9voient que les r\u00e9sidents permanents et les ressortissants \u00e9trangers sont interdits de territoire pour raison de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 s\u2019ils sont membres d\u2019une organisation dont il y a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019elle est, a \u00e9t\u00e9 ou sera l\u2019auteur de tout acte d\u2019espionnage \u00ab dirig\u00e9 contre le Canada ou contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb.\n[2] M. Yihdego ne nie pas qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 membre d\u2019une organisation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019auteur d\u2019actes d\u2019espionnage. Pour sa part, le ministre de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et de la Protection civile (le ministre) n\u2019all\u00e8gue pas que les actes d\u2019espionnage dont l\u2019organisation en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019auteur \u00e9taient \u00ab dirig\u00e9[s] contre le Canada \u00bb. La seule question en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent appel consiste donc \u00e0 savoir si la Section de l\u2019immigration de la Commission de l\u2019immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 a raisonnablement conclu que les actes d\u2019espionnage en cause \u00e9taient \u00ab contraire[s] aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb au sens o\u00f9 on l\u2019entend \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR. Pour parvenir \u00e0 cette conclusion, la Section de l\u2019immigration a estim\u00e9 que, selon cet alin\u00e9a, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire que les actes d\u2019espionnage en cause soient li\u00e9s \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du Canada ou \u00e0 ses int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[3] Dans une d\u00e9cision publi\u00e9e sous la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence 2020 CF 833, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019a donn\u00e9e la Section de l\u2019immigration \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable et que l\u2019expression \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb signifie qu\u2019il doit y avoir un lien entre les actes d\u2019espionnage et les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Section de l\u2019immigration et lui a renvoy\u00e9 le dossier de M. Yihdego pour nouvelle d\u00e9cision.\n[4] Dans sa d\u00e9cision par laquelle elle a accueilli la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de M. Yihdego, la Cour a certifi\u00e9 la question suivante :\nUne personne est-elle interdite de territoire au Canada conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)f) de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s parce qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 membre d\u2019une organisation dont il y a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9, qu\u2019elle est ou qu\u2019elle sera l\u2019auteur d\u2019actes d\u2019espionnage \u00ab contraire[s] aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la Loi, si les activit\u00e9s d\u2019espionnage de cette organisation ont lieu en dehors du Canada et ciblent des ressortissants \u00e9trangers de fa\u00e7on contraire aux valeurs qui sous-tendent la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s et le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9mocratique du Canada], notamment les libert\u00e9s fondamentales garanties par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2b) de la Charte?\n[5] Pour les motifs qui suivent, j\u2019estime que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas conclu \u00e0 tort que la d\u00e9cision de la Section de l\u2019immigration \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable et que l\u2019expression \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb signifie qu\u2019il doit y avoir un lien entre les actes d\u2019espionnage et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du Canada ou ses int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Je suis convaincue que la Section de l\u2019immigration n\u2019a pas tenu compte des contraintes juridiques d\u00e9coulant du droit international, notamment les dispositions en mati\u00e8re de non-refoulement de la Convention relative au statut des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, R.T. Can. 1969 no 6, de 1951, ainsi que les principes \u00e9tablis en mati\u00e8re d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois.\n[6] Par cons\u00e9quent, je r\u00e9pondrais \u00e0 la question certifi\u00e9e par la n\u00e9gative et je rejetterais l\u2019appel.\nI. Les faits [7] M. Yihdego, un citoyen de l\u2019\u00c9thiopie, est un ancien employ\u00e9 de l\u2019agence de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des r\u00e9seaux d\u2019information (INSA), une agence de renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en \u00c9thiopie, o\u00f9 il a occup\u00e9 le poste d\u2019analyste de protocole et ing\u00e9nieur de r\u00e9seaux de 2011 \u00e0 2014. M. Yihdego affirme que ses sup\u00e9rieurs ont fait pression sur lui pour qu\u2019il se joigne \u00e0 l\u2019unit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cryptage de l\u2019INSA et qu\u2019ils l\u2019ont menac\u00e9 et harcel\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il a refus\u00e9.\n[8] Pour \u00e9viter que ses sup\u00e9rieurs exercent davantage de pression sur lui, M. Yihdego a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de l\u2019INSA en 2014 pour faire des \u00e9tudes de cycles sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. M. Yihdego affirme qu\u2019\u00e0 son retour en \u00c9thiopie en 2017, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tenu par les services de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en raison de ses opinions politiques et de son appartenance \u00e0 un parti politique. Craignant de subir d\u2019autres mauvais traitements, M. Yihdego s\u2019est enfui au Canada muni d\u2019un visa de r\u00e9sident temporaire. Il a demand\u00e9 l\u2019asile au Canada quelques mois apr\u00e8s son arriv\u00e9e.\n[9] La demande d\u2019asile de M. Yihdego a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en suspens afin de permettre au ministre d\u2019examiner son admissibilit\u00e9 au Canada compte tenu du fait qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 travaill\u00e9 au sein de l\u2019INSA. M. Yihdego a ensuite fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate par la Section de l\u2019immigration.\nII. La d\u00e9cision de la Section de l\u2019immigration [10] Le ministre n\u2019a pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que M. Yihdego avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lui\u2011m\u00eame l\u2019auteur d\u2019actes d\u2019espionnage. Cela dit, dans sa d\u00e9cision X (Re), 2019 CanLII 132626, la Section de l\u2019immigration a tout de m\u00eame conclu que, comme il avait travaill\u00e9 au sein de l\u2019INSA, M. Yihdego \u00ab appartenait \u00e0 l\u2019organisation \u00bb. Elle a \u00e9galement conclu que l\u2019INSA s\u2019adonnait au cyberespionnage et qu\u2019elle utilisait des logiciels espions pour surveiller les membres de la diaspora \u00e9thiopienne ainsi qu\u2019une entit\u00e9 du secteur priv\u00e9 connue sous le nom de Ethiopian Satellite Television (ESAT) aux \u00c9tats-Unis. L\u2019ESAT est un r\u00e9seau ind\u00e9pendant de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, de radio et d\u2019information en ligne par satellite exploit\u00e9 par la diaspora \u00e9thiopienne dans plusieurs pays, dont les \u00c9tats-Unis et le Canada.\n[11] Aucune de ces conclusions n\u2019est contest\u00e9e dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent appel.\n[12] Le litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce porte sur la conclusion de la Section de l\u2019immigration selon laquelle les actes d\u2019espionnage commis par l\u2019INSA \u00e9taient \u00ab contraire[s] aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb, au sens o\u00f9 on l\u2019entend \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR.\n[13] En concluant que les actes d\u2019espionnage de l\u2019INSA \u00e9taient \u00ab contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb, la Section de l\u2019immigration a fait remarquer qu\u2019ils \u00ab \u00e9taient dirig\u00e9s contre des alli\u00e9s du Canada \u00bb et \u00ab contrevenaient de fa\u00e7on inacceptable aux valeurs sous\u2011jacentes \u00e0 la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s \u00bb. En outre, la Section de l\u2019immigration a conclu que les actes d\u2019espionnage de l\u2019INSA \u00ab ont nui au caract\u00e8re d\u00e9mocratique du Canada et \u00e0 la protection des droits garantis \u00bb (toutes les citations proviennent du para. 120). Ces conclusions sont au c\u0153ur du pr\u00e9sent appel.\n[14] Compte tenu de cette interpr\u00e9tation de ce qui pourrait \u00eatre \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb, la Section de l\u2019immigration a conclu que M. Yihdego \u00e9tait interdit de territoire en application des alin\u00e9as 34(1)a) et f) de la LIPR parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait membre d\u2019une organisation dont il y a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019elle est l\u2019auteur d\u2019actes d\u2019espionnage.\nIII. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [15] La contestation de M. Yihdego \u00e9tait principalement ax\u00e9e sur la conclusion de la Section de l\u2019immigration selon laquelle les actes d\u2019espionnage de l\u2019INSA \u00e9taient \u00ab contraires aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb.\n[16] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accueilli la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de M. Yihdego, adoptant le raisonnement qu\u2019elle avait suivi dans la d\u00e9cision Weldemariam c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2020 CF 631 (Weldemariam). Dans cette d\u00e9cision, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que la conclusion de la Section de l\u2019immigration selon laquelle le demandeur \u00e9tait interdit de territoire reposait sur une interpr\u00e9tation trop large et, partant, d\u00e9raisonnable de l\u2019expression \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement conclu dans cette d\u00e9cision que, selon l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable qu\u2019il convient de donner \u00e0 cette expression, il doit y avoir un lien entre les actes d\u2019espionnage en cause et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du Canada.\n[17] Dans le cas de M. Yihdego, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, partie I de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, annexe B de la Loi de 1982 sur le Canada, 1982, ch. 11 (R.-U.), ne s\u2019appliquait ni \u00e0 l\u2019INSA, ni aux journalistes pris pour cibles par cette derni\u00e8re, car ils se trouvaient tous en dehors du Canada. Bien que l\u2019INSA ait pu agir d\u2019une mani\u00e8re allant \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des valeurs canadiennes, cela n\u2019\u00e9quivaut pas \u00e0 une menace pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du Canada. Selon la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la conclusion de la Section de l\u2019immigration selon laquelle l\u2019INSA a commis des actes d\u2019espionnage contre un important alli\u00e9 du Canada \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable, car rien ne d\u00e9montrait que les \u00c9tats-Unis ou les citoyens de ce pays \u00e9taient vis\u00e9s. En outre, m\u00eame si c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, la Section de l\u2019immigration n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 en quoi un tel acte serait contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nIV. La question en litige [18] Comme je le mentionne plus haut, la seule question en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent appel consiste \u00e0 savoir si la fa\u00e7on dont la Section de l\u2019immigration a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR \u00e9tait raisonnable et si, pour qu\u2019un acte d\u2019espionnage soit vis\u00e9 par cette disposition, et donc contraire aux \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb, il doit y avoir un lien entre celui\u2011ci et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du Canada ou ses int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nV. La norme de contr\u00f4le [19] Le r\u00f4le de notre Cour dans le cadre d\u2019un appel comme celui\u2011ci consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a choisi la bonne norme de contr\u00f4le \u2013 celle de la d\u00e9cision correcte ou celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable \u2013 et si elle l\u2019a appliqu\u00e9e correctement (Office r\u00e9gional de la sant\u00e9 du Nord c. Horrocks, 2021 CSC 42, au paras. 10 \u00e0 12; Agraira c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2013 CSC 36, aux paras. 45 \u00e0 47). Pour ce faire, nous devons nous mettre \u00e0 la place du juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et axer notre intervention sur la d\u00e9cision administrative du tribunal d\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieure.\n[20] Notre Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9mis des r\u00e9serves au sujet de l\u2019application de la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable \u00e0 des instances o\u00f9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a certifi\u00e9 des questions au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 74d) de la LIPR, \u00e0 plus forte raison dans les cas o\u00f9, comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, elle est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre par l\u2019affirmative ou par la n\u00e9gative \u00e0 des questions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois (voir, p. ex., Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration) c. Galindo Camayo, 2022 CAF 50, aux paras. 40 \u00e0 44). Voir \u00e9galement l\u2019opinion dissidente de la juge C\u00f4t\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mason c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2023 CSC 21, aux paras. 126 et 152. N\u00e9anmoins, les juges majoritaires dans cet arr\u00eat ont conclu que la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable est celle que les cours de r\u00e9vision doivent appliquer lorsqu\u2019elles se penchent sur des questions certifi\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration.\n[21] Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 l\u2019instar des parties, je suis d\u2019avis que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu \u00e0 juste titre que la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable \u00e9tait celle qu\u2019il convenait d\u2019appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation par la Section de l\u2019immigration de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR, en particulier l\u2019expression \u00ab contraire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb. Notre Cour doit donc d\u00e9terminer si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a correctement appliqu\u00e9 la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nVI. Analyse [22] La question que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a certifi\u00e9e dans le cas de M. Yihdego est la m\u00eame que celle qu\u2019elle avait certifi\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Weldemariam. Les appels que le ministre a interjet\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des deux d\u00e9cisions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus ensemble et les arguments que les parties ont fait valoir dans les deux cas sont essentiellement les m\u00eames.\n[23] Notre Cour a fait une analyse d\u00e9taill\u00e9e du droit international et d\u2019autres questions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois portant sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR dans l\u2019arr\u00eat qu\u2019elle a rendu par suite de l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par M. Weldemariam et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu en m\u00eame temps que la d\u00e9cision en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile) c. Weldemariam, 2024 CAF 69 (arr\u00eat Weldemariam)). Cette analyse s\u2019applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par M. Yihdego.\n[24] Ainsi, pour les motifs expos\u00e9s par notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Weldemariam, j\u2019ai conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019y a qu\u2019une fa\u00e7on raisonnable d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019expression contest\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR, \u00e0 savoir que les r\u00e9sidents permanents et les ressortissants \u00e9trangers ne peuvent \u00eatre interdits de territoire en application des alin\u00e9as 34(1)a) et 34(1)f) de la LIPR que si les actes d\u2019espionnage auxquels ils ont pris part \u2013 que ce soit directement ou indirectement \u2013 visaient le Canada ou avaient un lien avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du Canada ou ses int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, la d\u00e9cision de la Section de l\u2019immigration \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable, et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en l\u2019infirmant.\n[25] Notre Cour doit maintenant d\u00e9terminer si le dossier de M. Yihdego doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la Section de l\u2019immigration pour nouvelle d\u00e9cision.\n[26] Comme dans le cas de M. Weldemariam, rien n\u2019indique que les journalistes de l\u2019ESAT vis\u00e9s vivaient au Canada. En outre, la preuve dont disposait la Section d\u2019immigration ne d\u00e9montrait pas que les actes de l\u2019INSA visaient l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien, des entreprises canadiennes, des institutions canadiennes ou des Canadiens, dont des membres de la diaspora \u00e9thiopienne. Rien n\u2019indiquait non plus que les actes de l\u2019INSA avaient un lien quelconque avec la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du Canada ou ses int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils ne visaient pas les \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada \u00bb au sens o\u00f9 on l\u2019entend \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 34(1)a) de la LIPR.\n[27] Il n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que M. Yihdego \u00e9tait membre d\u2019une organisation qui \u00e9tait l\u2019auteur d\u2019actes d\u2019espionnage dirig\u00e9s contre le Canada ou qui \u00e9taient li\u00e9s \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du Canada ou \u00e0 ses int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, les alin\u00e9as 34(1)a) et 34(1)f) de la LIPR ne permettent pas \u00e0 notre Cour de conclure que M. Yihdego est interdit de territoire au Canada. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le ministre n\u2019a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 aucun autre motif pour d\u00e9montrer que M. Yihdego \u00e9tait interdit de territoire, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de renvoyer l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la Section de l\u2019immigration pour nouvelle d\u00e9cision.\nVII. Conclusion [28] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je suis convaincue que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en concluant que la d\u00e9cision de la Section de l\u2019immigration \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable. Je r\u00e9pondrais par la n\u00e9gative \u00e0 la question certifi\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et je rejetterais l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par le ministre.\n\u00ab Anne L.

Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2023 CF 31, par laquelle la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (du juge Southcott) a rejet\u00e9 la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les appelants en vue de contester le processus de nomination des juges pr\u00e9vu aux articles 96 et 101 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867. Selon eux, le processus de nomination est soumis au pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, \u00e0 l\u2019influence et \u00e0 l\u2019ing\u00e9rence politiques du ministre f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de la Justice et du Cabinet. Les appelants ont soutenu devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale que ce pouvoir, cette influence et cette ing\u00e9rence minent l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance institutionnelle de la magistrature, en violation des articles 7 et 24 et de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 11d) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s et de l\u2019article 96 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867.\n[2] Devant notre Cour, les appelants pr\u00e9tendent que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis des erreurs susceptibles de r\u00e9vision tant dans ses d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re de preuve, dans lesquelles elle a jug\u00e9 inadmissible une grande partie de la preuve qu\u2019ils avaient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, que dans son traitement de leur demande au fond.\n[3] En ce qui concerne les d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re de preuve, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a radi\u00e9 plusieurs paragraphes des deux affidavits de l\u2019un des appelants, Duff Conacher, ainsi que plusieurs pi\u00e8ces jointes \u00e0 ces affidavits. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que ces paragraphes et ces pi\u00e8ces constituaient soit une preuve par ou\u00ef-dire inadmissible, soit un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion inadmissible qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un t\u00e9moin expert comp\u00e9tent. Elle a \u00e9galement conclu que le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion que les appelants cherchaient \u00e0 faire admettre n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pertinent pour les questions en litige, puisque la Cour devait appliquer un crit\u00e8re objectif pour d\u00e9terminer si les juges et les tribunaux peuvent raisonnablement \u00eatre per\u00e7us comme ind\u00e9pendants.\n[4] Une grande partie des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve radi\u00e9s par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale consistait en des articles de journaux, des \u00e9ditoriaux et des articles d\u2019opinion publi\u00e9s dans des journaux ou sur les sites Web de journaux. En outre, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a radi\u00e9 une lettre du Conseil canadien de la magistrature (le CCM), un rapport de 2016 de la section canadienne de la Commission internationale de juristes (la CIJ), un article r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par un professeur de droit ainsi que des observations du pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019Association du Barreau canadien (l\u2019ABC) et d\u2019autres associations concernant le processus de nomination judiciaire. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que ces derni\u00e8res observations et l\u2019article universitaire, bien qu\u2019ils soient inadmissibles parce qu\u2019ils constituent un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion, pouvaient malgr\u00e9 tout \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9s par les appelants comme sources juridiques \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leurs arguments.\n[5] Devant notre Cour, les appelants pr\u00e9tendent que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis des erreurs manifestes et d\u00e9terminantes en concluant \u00e0 l\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 de certains des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve mentionn\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, ils font valoir que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb conclure que deux des articles de journaux et la lettre du CCM, qu\u2019elle a radi\u00e9s au motif qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une preuve par ou\u00ef-dire inadmissible, satisfaisaient au double crit\u00e8re de la fiabilit\u00e9 et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, et qu\u2019elle a commis une erreur en concluant le contraire. Ils soutiennent \u00e9galement que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en concluant que certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve constituaient un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion inadmissible. Selon eux, contrairement aux conclusions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, certains des articles d\u2019opinion publi\u00e9s dans des journaux, le rapport de la section canadienne de la CIJ ainsi que la d\u00e9claration du pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019ABC, que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a qualifi\u00e9s de t\u00e9moignages d\u2019opinion, auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre jug\u00e9s admissibles en tant que preuve factuelle fiable et n\u00e9cessaire ou similaire \u00e0 la preuve invoqu\u00e9e dans les arr\u00eats Libman c. Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1997] 3 R.C.S. 569, 1997 CanLII 326 (CSC) [Libman], Harper c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2004 CSC 33, [2004] 1 R.C.S. 827 [Harper], et R. c. Bryan, 2007 CSC 12, [2007] 1 R.C.S. 527 [Bryan].\n[6] Je ne suis pas de cet avis et, sauf une exception mineure qui n\u2019a aucun rapport avec l\u2019issue du pr\u00e9sent appel, je ne vois pas d\u2019erreur dans les d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re de preuve de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[7] Les articles de journaux ne sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas admissibles, car ils constituent une preuve par ou\u00ef-dire et ne satisfont pas au crit\u00e8re de fiabilit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00eatre admis en preuve devant la cour (voir, par exemple, Nation Tsleil-Waututh c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CAF 104, au para. 39; Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration) c. Conseil canadien pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, 2021 CAF 72, [2021] 3 R.C.F. 294, au para. 150, inf. pour d\u2019autres motifs par 2023 CSC 17). Rien ne permet d\u2019annuler la conclusion de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale concernant l\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 des articles de journaux qui, selon les appelants, auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre admis.\n[8] Je suis d\u2019accord avec les appelants pour dire que la pi\u00e8ce \u00ab F \u00bb jointe au premier affidavit de M. Conacher a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9e \u00e0 tort d\u2019article de journal par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au paragraphe 33 de ses motifs. En fait, comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019a reconnu au paragraphe 32, il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t d\u2019une lettre extraite du site Web du CCM. Dans cette lettre, le CCM signalait notamment qu\u2019un membre de l\u2019appareil judiciaire avait reconnu avoir fourni au cabinet du ministre de la Justice, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 des demandes de renseignements, le nom des candidats au poste de magistrat.\n[9] Malgr\u00e9 cette interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e, je conviens avec la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale que la pi\u00e8ce \u00ab F \u00bb jointe au premier affidavit de M. Conacher contient une preuve par ou\u00ef-dire inadmissible. Le fait qu\u2019un membre de l\u2019appareil judiciaire ait reconnu avoir fourni le nom des candidats au poste de magistrat, tel qu\u2019il est d\u00e9crit dans la lettre du CCM, constitue du ou\u00ef-dire. \u00c0 mon avis, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur justifiant l\u2019intervention de notre Cour en concluant que les appelants n\u2019avaient pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter la lettre pour \u00e9tablir le fait qui y est signal\u00e9, vu qu\u2019elle ne disposait d\u2019aucune preuve d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019il leur \u00e9tait impossible d\u2019obtenir la preuve directe de ce fait. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a jamais ni\u00e9 que le ministre de la Justice m\u00e8ne des consultations au sujet des nominations. Les pi\u00e8ces \u00ab C \u00bb, \u00ab D \u00bb et \u00ab E \u00bb jointes au deuxi\u00e8me affidavit de M. Conacher, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es admissibles par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 d\u2019autres consultations de ce type.\n[10] En ce qui concerne les \u00e9l\u00e9ments radi\u00e9s au motif qu\u2019ils constituent un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion, ce que les appelants contestent, les articles d\u2019opinion parus dans des journaux ou sur des sites Web ne portent pas sur des faits et, s\u2019ils contiennent des d\u00e9clarations factuelles, constituent du ou\u00ef-dire inadmissible pour les motifs d\u00e9j\u00e0 expos\u00e9s. Les parties du rapport de la section canadienne de la CIJ que les appelants cherchent \u00e0 invoquer constituent du ou\u00ef-dire puisqu\u2019elles rendent compte d\u2019enqu\u00eates confidentielles men\u00e9es par ses membres. Les appelants n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 la fiabilit\u00e9 ou la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de ces d\u00e9clarations relat\u00e9es. Le reste du rapport de la section canadienne de la CIJ expose le processus de nomination, d\u00e9j\u00e0 port\u00e9 \u00e0 la connaissance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au moyen d\u2019une preuve directe fournie par le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9, ou son opinion sur la fa\u00e7on dont le processus de nomination judiciaire pourrait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9. Quant \u00e0 la lettre du pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019ABC, elle exprime l\u2019opinion de cette association et n\u2019est pas factuelle.\n[11] Nul ne conteste que ces opinions n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es par un expert et n\u2019ont pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un contre-interrogatoire. Comme l\u2019indique la Cour supr\u00eame au paragraphe 43 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mattel, Inc. c. 3894207 Canada Inc., 2006 CSC 22, [2006] 1 R.C.S. 772, la preuve par sondage d\u2019opinion, lorsqu\u2019elle est pertinente, doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un expert comp\u00e9tent qui peut \u00eatre contre-interrog\u00e9 au sujet de la conception et de la conduite du sondage. De plus, il convient d\u2019\u00e9tablir une distinction entre les opinions exprim\u00e9es dans les journaux, le rapport de la section canadienne de la CIJ et la lettre du pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019ABC, d\u2019une part, et les sondages et rapports dont il est question dans les arr\u00eats Libman, Harper et Bryan, d\u2019autre part. Comme l\u2019intim\u00e9 le mentionne \u00e0 juste titre, dans ces affaires, les rapports avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par des experts ou \u00e9taient d\u2019une tout autre nature, comme le rapport de la Commission royale soumis \u00e0 la Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bryan. Contrairement aux appelants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les parties dans ces affaires n\u2019ont pas tent\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion d\u2019un t\u00e9moin ordinaire.\n[12] Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne rel\u00e8ve aucune erreur dans la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019\u00e9carter les articles d\u2019opinion, le rapport de la section canadienne de la CIJ et la d\u00e9claration du pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019ABC.\n[13] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont disposait la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale apr\u00e8s coup, et dont dispose maintenant notre Cour, reposent sur de simples conjectures quant \u00e0 des facteurs non pertinents qui pourraient \u00eatre pris en compte dans le processus de nomination judiciaire. En effet, devant notre Cour, les appelants pr\u00e9sentent leurs arguments sous l\u2019angle de ce qui \u00ab pourrait arriver \u00bb dans ce processus et de la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019un parti au pouvoir consid\u00e8re les all\u00e9geances politiques ant\u00e9rieures des candidats comme un crit\u00e8re de nomination important. Or, rien ne prouve que c\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 arriv\u00e9. Le simple fait que le ministre de la Justice nomme certains membres des comit\u00e9s consultatifs de la magistrature ou qu\u2019il puisse consulter d\u2019autres personnes, y compris des coll\u00e8gues du Cabinet, au sujet d\u2019\u00e9ventuelles nominations judiciaires ne suffit pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance institutionnelle de la magistrature est compromise d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui viole les articles 7 et 24 et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 11d) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, ainsi que l\u2019article 96 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867.\n[14] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en rejetant la demande des appelants. Dans les circonstances, je refuse de dire si, dans une instance qui s\u2019y pr\u00eate, la cour pourrait parvenir \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente si elle disposait d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve admissibles diff\u00e9rents sur le fonctionnement ou la composition des comit\u00e9s consultatifs de la magistrature ou sur les consultations men\u00e9es durant le processus de nomination. Il vaut mieux attendre une autre occasion pour examiner cette question. Je refuserais donc de conclure cat\u00e9goriquement que les seules conditions essentielles de l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance institutionnelle de la magistrature sont l\u2019inamovibilit\u00e9, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de traitement et l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance administrative. En effet, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Valente c. La Reine, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 673, 1985 CanLII 25 (CSC), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada n\u2019a pas totalement exclu la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019un tribunal puisse un jour conclure que l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance de la magistrature englobe d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments.\n[15] Par cons\u00e9quent, je rejetterais le pr\u00e9sent appel. Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait sollicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9pens, je n\u2019en adjugerais pas pour les m\u00eames raisons que celles expos\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n\u00ab Mary J.L.

Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019employeur lui reprochait d\u2019avoir n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de suivre la formation obligatoire et de s\u2019\u00eatre autoris\u00e9e une procuration \u00e0 son nom pour le compte d\u2019un ami, client de Desjardins, sans en faire part \u00e0 l\u2019employeur.\n[2] Suite \u00e0 ce cong\u00e9diement, Mme Lachebi a soumis une demande de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi aux termes de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi, L.C. 1996, ch. 23 (la Loi). La Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi (la Commission) a refus\u00e9 la demande de Mme Lachebi au motif qu\u2019elle avait perdu son emploi en raison de sa propre inconduite au sens des articles 29 et 30 de la Loi. Insatisfaite de cette d\u00e9cision, Mme Lachebi s\u2019est pourvue devant la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale (la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale), laquelle a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. Mme Lachebi en a appel\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision e la Division d\u2019appel du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale (la Division d\u2019appel). Le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2019, la Division d\u2019appel a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de Mme Lachebi, estimant qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas mati\u00e8re \u00e0 intervenir.\n[3] C\u2019est de cette d\u00e9cision dont se pourvoit Mme Lachebi en l\u2019instance aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 28(1)(g.1) de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. 1985, c. F-7. Elle soutient, pour l\u2019essentiel, dans son m\u00e9moire, que la Division d\u2019appel aurait d\u00fb intervenir puisqu\u2019elle aurait fait la preuve devant la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait jamais eu l\u2019intention de contrevenir au code de d\u00e9ontologie de l\u2019employeur, ne sachant pas, en fait, que les gestes qu\u2019on lui reprochait pouvaient constituer une inconduite et encore moins que cela pouvait mener \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement. Dit autrement, il n\u2019y avait rien de d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 dans sa conduite, un fait que tant la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que la Division d\u2019appel auraient ignor\u00e9 ou auquel elles n\u2019auraient pas donn\u00e9 suffisamment de poids.\n[4] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, Mme Lachebi, qui se repr\u00e9sente maintenant seule, est revenue sur les circonstances de son cong\u00e9diement, mettant l\u2019emphase sur le fait que l\u2019employeur l\u2019aurait faussement accus\u00e9e de vol. Toutefois, comme je lui ai mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, rien au dossier ne relie l\u2019inconduite qui lui est reproch\u00e9e aux fins des articles 29 et 30 de la Loi \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations de vol si bien qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont aucune pertinence en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[5] Bien qu\u2019on puisse \u00e9prouver de la sympathie pour Mme Lachebi eu \u00e9gard aux cons\u00e9quences qu\u2019a eues pour elle ce cong\u00e9diement, dont la justification n\u2019est, du reste, pas en cause ici, sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire ne peut r\u00e9ussir. Il est bien \u00e9tabli que la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable aux d\u00e9cisions de la Division d\u2019appel est celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable (Balkanyi c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2021 CAF 164 au para. 13; voir \u00e9galement Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65 (Vavilov)). Le r\u00f4le de cette Cour, en application de cette norme de contr\u00f4le, consiste \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que la d\u00e9cision de la Division d\u2019appel repose sur un raisonnement rationnel et logique et qu\u2019elle se situe, au niveau du r\u00e9sultat, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la fourchette des issues possibles et acceptables au regard des faits de l\u2019affaire et du droit applicable (Vavilov aux para. 84-86; Dunsmuir c. Nouveau-Brunswick, 2008 CSC 9 au para. 47). Il n\u2019est pas, et c\u2019est important de le rappeler, de reconsid\u00e9rer la d\u00e9cision de la Division d\u2019appel, r\u00e9\u00e9valuer la preuve au dossier et substituer ses propres conclusions \u00e0 celles de la Division d\u2019appel (Vavilov au para. 83). En d\u2019autres termes, la Cour n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 pour juger l\u2019affaire de nouveau.\n[6] Je suis d\u2019avis ici que la Division d\u2019appel n\u2019a commis aucune erreur pouvant justifier l\u2019intervention de la Cour. D\u2019une part, elle a bien identifi\u00e9 le r\u00f4le qui \u00e9tait le sien en appel de la d\u00e9cision de la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. D\u2019autre part, elle a rappel\u00e9, \u00e0 juste titre, que la notion d\u2019inconduite au sens des articles 29 et 30 de la Loi n\u2019exigeait pas la preuve d\u2019une intention coupable. Selon la Division d\u2019appel, pour qu\u2019il y ait une telle inconduite, le comportement reproch\u00e9 doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 volontaire ou, du moins, doit avoir r\u00e9sult\u00e9 \u00ab d\u2019une telle insouciance ou n\u00e9gligence que l\u2019on pourrait dire que l\u2019employ\u00e9 a volontairement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas tenir compte des r\u00e9percussions que ses actes auraient sur son rendement \u00bb (D\u00e9cision de la Division d\u2019appel au para. 15).\n[7] Appliquant ce test aux faits de l\u2019affaire, la Division d\u2019appel a, au paragraphe 18 de sa d\u00e9cision, conclu ce qui suit :\nLa preuve non contredite devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u00e9montre que [Mme Lachebi] devait suivre une formation obligatoire depuis le mois de janvier 2018, ce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas fait avant le mois d\u2019avril 2018. Suite \u00e0 sa formation, [Mme Lachebi] a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas d\u00e9poser une procuration personnelle dans un compte client. Elle a donc proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la retirer. Elle n\u2019a jamais avis\u00e9 son employeur du retrait de la procuration car elle craignait la r\u00e9action de l\u2019employeur. [Mme Lachebi] avait l\u2019habitude d\u2019agir de fa\u00e7on transparente lorsqu\u2019elle effectuait des transactions personnelles.\n[8] Cette omission de Mme Lachebi de suivre ses formations obligatoires, en plus de constituer en soi une faute, selon la Division d\u2019appel, en a entrain\u00e9 une autre, soit celle de \u00ab s\u2019octroy[er] une procuration dans le compte d\u2019un ami client alors que cela est interdit par l\u2019employeur \u00bb (D\u00e9cision de la Division d\u2019appel au para. 22).\n[9] L\u2019approche suivie par la Division d\u2019appel me parait conforme aux enseignements de cette Cour suivant lesquels il y a inconduite au sens des articles 29 et 30 de la Loi \u00ab lorsque le prestataire savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir que sa conduite \u00e9tait de nature \u00e0 entraver l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses obligations envers son employeur et que, de ce fait, il \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement possible qu\u2019il soit cong\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00bb (Mishibinijima c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 36 au para. 14) [Mon soulignement]. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve qu\u2019elle avait devant elle, il lui \u00e9tait d\u00e8s lors loisible, \u00e0 mon sens, de conclure comme elle l\u2019a fait.\n[10] Mme Lachebi aurait bien \u00e9videmment souhait\u00e9 un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent, mais l\u00e0 n\u2019est pas le test \u00e0 satisfaire pour faire droit \u00e0 sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. En d\u2019autres termes, elle devait nous convaincre que la d\u00e9cision de la Division d\u2019appel est d\u00e9raisonnable, ce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire. Au contraire, ladite d\u00e9cision poss\u00e8de, selon moi, les attributs de la raisonnabilit\u00e9 dans la mesure o\u00f9 on peut en dire qu\u2019elle est rationnelle, logique et support\u00e9e tant par le droit que par la preuve. Je r\u00e9it\u00e8re que notre r\u00f4le n\u2019est pas de nous demander ce que nous aurions d\u00e9cid\u00e9 si nous avions \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la place de la Division d\u2019appel. Notre r\u00f4le se limite \u00e0 nous pencher sur la raisonnabilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de cette derni\u00e8re, un exercice qui suppose qu\u2019il puisse y avoir plus qu\u2019une issue possible et acceptable au regard des faits et du droit.\n[11] Je propose donc de rejeter la pr\u00e9sente demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Comme le d\u00e9fendeur ne les r\u00e9clame pas, je le ferais sans d\u00e9pens.\n[12] Enfin, pour la bonne forme, le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, tel que le souligne avec raison le d\u00e9fendeur, aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme d\u00e9fendeur en l\u2019instance au lieu et place du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale. Je propose donc que ce changement soit fait et qu\u2019il soit refl\u00e9t\u00e9 dans l\u2019intitul\u00e9 des pr\u00e9sents motifs et dans celui du jugement.\n\u00ab Ren\u00e9 LeBlanc \u00bb\nj.c.a.\n\u00ab Je suis d\u2019accord.\nSylvie E.

Aux termes de sa d\u00e9cision, la Commission rejetait le grief log\u00e9 par le demandeur, alors agent de programmes pour le compte de Ressources humaines et d\u00e9veloppement des comp\u00e9tences Canada, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de son licenciement, le 18 avril 2013, pour infraction au Code des valeurs et d\u2019\u00e9thique du secteur public, furetage dans les bases de donn\u00e9es de l\u2019assurance-emploi et participation \u00e0 une fraude de plusieurs centaines de milliers de dollars. En marge de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements, le demandeur a, en novembre 2019, \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de chefs d\u2019accusation de fraude et de complot par la chambre criminelle de la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[2] Le demandeur reproche trois choses \u00e0 la Commission, toutes en lien avec la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019employeur a men\u00e9 l\u2019enqu\u00eate administrative qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 son licenciement. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le demandeur plaide que la Commission n\u2019a pas appliqu\u00e9 les bons crit\u00e8res pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019employeur :\na) a failli \u00e0 son obligation d\u2019impartialit\u00e9;\nb)l\u2019a priv\u00e9 d\u2019une audition \u00e9quitable au cours du processus d\u00e9cisionnel qui a conduit au licenciement; et\nc)a outrepass\u00e9 les pouvoirs que lui conf\u00e8re \u00ab la loi sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du gouvernement \u00bb dans la conduite de l\u2019enqu\u00eate administrative ayant men\u00e9 au licenciement;\n[3] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la Commission dit avoir attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention du demandeur \u00e0 la jurisprudence de notre Cour (Tipple c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1985] A.C.F. No. 818 (QL); Patanguli c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2015 CAF 291 au para. 38; voir aussi Canada (Attorney General) v. Gallinger, 2022 FCA 177 au para. 58) suivant laquelle les proc\u00e9dures devant la Commission sont de novo, faisant en sorte que \u00ab toutes les irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s pendant l\u2019enqu\u00eate et le processus pr\u00e9-disciplinaire sont rem\u00e9di\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience devant la Commission \u00bb.\n[4] Nous sommes tous d\u2019avis que la Commission a vu juste et que par cons\u00e9quent, la pr\u00e9sente demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire doit \u00e9chouer. Il est en effet bien \u00e9tabli que la Commission, lorsqu\u2019elle est saisie d\u2019un grief, proc\u00e8de comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une nouvelle affaire o\u00f9 il appartient \u00e0 l\u2019employeur de justifier la d\u00e9cision qui fait l\u2019objet du grief, comme l\u2019a rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre la Commission aux paragraphes 186, 191 et 235 de sa d\u00e9cision. Selon le test applicable en cette mati\u00e8re, il incombait \u00e0 l\u2019employeur d\u2019\u00e9tablir les faits invoqu\u00e9s pour justifier l\u2019imposition du licenciement; il se devait aussi de justifier le caract\u00e8re non-excessif de cette mesure eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances de l\u2019affaire (Basra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2010 CAF 24 aux para. 24\u201326). \u00c0 cette fin, l\u2019employeur a fait entendre un certain nombre de t\u00e9moins, tout comme le demandeur qui a aussi offert son propre t\u00e9moignage.\n[5] Comme nous l\u2019avons dit \u00e0 plusieurs reprises au demandeur \u00e0 l\u2019audience, c\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de cette proc\u00e9dure, devant la Commission, qui est pertinente devant nous, et non celle devant l\u2019employeur, et nous sommes d\u2019avis que ladite proc\u00e9dure s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e9quitable, le demandeur ayant a eu pleinement l\u2019occasion de faire valoir ses moyens.\n[6] M\u00eame si cela n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la pr\u00e9sente demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, nous sommes \u00e9galement d\u2019avis, quant au m\u00e9rite m\u00eame de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas davantage lieu d\u2019intervenir. Comme le souligne le d\u00e9fendeur, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est r\u00e9visable, sur ce plan, selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable (Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65; Desjarlais c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2024 CAF 14 au para. 5). Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une norme d\u00e9f\u00e9rente qui invite la Cour \u00e0 se demander si la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est fond\u00e9e sur un raisonnement intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rent et si elle est justifi\u00e9e au regard des contraintes juridiques et factuelles pertinentes (Vavilov aux para. 84\u201385). Notre r\u00f4le n\u2019est pas de reconsid\u00e9rer le grief du demandeur, mettre en doute les conclusions tir\u00e9es par la Commission et, ultimement, substituer nos propres conclusions aux siennes. Bref, nous sommes tous d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, qui conclut que l\u2019employeur a rencontr\u00e9 le fardeau qui \u00e9tait le sien de justifier le licenciement du demandeur, est \u00e9toff\u00e9e, rationnelle et logique et passe ainsi le test de la coh\u00e9rence et de la justification.\n[7] Pour toutes ces raisons, la pr\u00e9sente demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire sera rejet\u00e9e. Le d\u00e9fendeur demande les d\u00e9pens. Nous ne voyons ici aucun facteur qui militerait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la r\u00e8gle usuelle voulant que les d\u00e9pens soient attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 la partie qui a gain de cause. Le d\u00e9fendeur aura donc droit \u00e0 ses d\u00e9pens.\n\u00ab Ren\u00e9 LeBlanc \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\nA-281-23\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nROGER KLOUVI c.

T\u20102.\n[7] La principale all\u00e9gation formul\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant devant la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e9tait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas pu produire ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus pour les ann\u00e9es 2017 \u00e0 2019 malgr\u00e9 la demande du ministre parce que sa r\u00e9sidence, o\u00f9 se trouvaient ses documents fiscaux, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie en 2017 dans le cadre d\u2019affaires non li\u00e9es. Il a \u00e9galement soutenu qu\u2019il aurait d\u00fb avoir droit \u00e0 des d\u00e9ductions, en particulier \u00e0 un amortissement, ce qui aurait eu pour effet de diminuer son revenu imposable par rapport aux cotisations \u00e9tablies.\n[8] La transcription de l\u2019instance devant la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e9tablit que l\u2019appelant a reconnu avoir touch\u00e9 les types de revenu d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par le ministre, sans toutefois \u00eatre certain des montants exacts. L\u2019appelant a \u00e9galement admis qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas produit de d\u00e9claration pour les ann\u00e9es 2017, 2018 et 2019.\n[9] La transcription \u00e9tablit \u00e9galement que l\u2019amortissement auquel l\u2019appelant dit avoir droit (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la d\u00e9duction pour amortissement \u00e0 des fins fiscales) se rapporte \u00e0 du mat\u00e9riel de musique qu\u2019il a achet\u00e9 plusieurs ann\u00e9es auparavant. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait un solde report\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9duire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 au moins 2027.\n[10] Mis \u00e0 part son t\u00e9moignage oral, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pour r\u00e9futer les hypoth\u00e8ses du ministre selon lesquelles, pour chaque ann\u00e9e de 2017 \u00e0 2019, il avait gagn\u00e9 des revenus du montant \u00e9tabli par le ministre dans ses cotisations. La Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a conclu que, bien que l\u2019appelant [traduction] \u00ab a[it] fait allusion \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 un amortissement, [il] n\u2019a fourni \u00e0 la Cour [de l\u2019imp\u00f4t] aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve convaincant attaquant les hypoth\u00e8ses du ministre \u00bb. La Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a fait valoir que les renseignements sur les soldes de l\u2019amortissement auraient d\u00fb figurer dans les d\u00e9clarations qu\u2019il avait produites avant 2017.\n[11] S\u2019appuyant sur les hypoth\u00e8ses du ministre et les admissions de l\u2019appelant, la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a conclu que les cotisations \u00e9taient valides et rejet\u00e9 les appels. Elle a refus\u00e9 d\u2019examiner les autres all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant, affirmant qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour le faire.\n[12] L\u2019appelante interjette appel de cette d\u00e9cision devant notre Cour.\nII. Analyse\nA. Notre Cour peut-elle rejeter sommairement un appel?\n[13] La Cour peut rejeter sommairement un appel \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une requ\u00eate d\u2019un intim\u00e9 ou de sa propre initiative, lorsque l\u2019appel est \u00ab manifestement vou[\u00e9] \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chec \u00e0 cause d\u2019un vice fondamental ou de l\u2019absence de bien-fond\u00e9 \u00bb : Bernard c. Canada (Institut professionnel de la fonction publique), 2019 CAF 236, par. 10.\n[14] Le pouvoir de la Cour \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9mane de sa comp\u00e9tence pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re, qui lui conf\u00e8re les pouvoirs n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 son bon fonctionnement et les pouvoirs n\u00e9cessaires pour g\u00e9rer ses propres instances : Dugr\u00e9 c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2021 CAF 8 [Dugr\u00e9], par. 20 \u00e0 22. Les appels qui sont manifestement vou\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chec, mais qui demeurent n\u00e9anmoins sur le r\u00f4le, \u00ab donnent lieu \u00e0 un gaspillage de ressources judiciaires et entravent l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice pour ceux qui exercent des recours m\u00e9ritoires \u00bb : Dugr\u00e9, par. 22, renvoyant aux arr\u00eats H\u00e9bert c. Wenham, 2020 CAF 186, par. 8, et Fabrikant c. Canada, 2018 CAF 224, par. 25.\nB. L\u2019appel est-il manifestement vou\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chec?\n[15] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la d\u00e9cision de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t port\u00e9e en appel a produit deux effets : le rejet de l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des cotisations et le refus d\u2019accorder ou d\u2019envisager toute autre r\u00e9paration que l\u2019appelant demandait \u00e0 la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. J\u2019examine tour \u00e0 tour chacun de ces effets dans les paragraphes ci-dessous.\n[16] Toutefois, il est important de garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit ce que l\u2019appelant doit \u00e9tablir pour avoir gain de cause dans le pr\u00e9sent appel. Compte tenu de la norme de contr\u00f4le applicable \u2013 la norme de contr\u00f4le en appel \u2013, l\u2019appelant doit \u00e9tablir que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a commis une erreur manifeste et dominante en tranchant une question de fait ou une question mixte de fait et de droit, ou que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a commis une erreur de droit : Housen c. Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33. Une erreur \u00ab manifeste \u00bb s\u2019entend d\u2019une erreur \u00e9vidente, et une erreur \u00ab dominante \u00bb est une erreur qui touche directement \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire \u2013 en d\u2019autres termes, qui influerait sur celle-ci : Benhaim c. St\u2010Germain, 2016 CSC 48, par. 38, citant Canada c. South Yukon Forest Corporation, 2012 CAF 165, par. 46.\n[17] De plus, comme le fait valoir l\u2019intim\u00e9, le paragraphe 27(1.3) de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. (1985), ch. F-7, restreint les motifs d\u2019appel des jugements sous le r\u00e9gime de la proc\u00e9dure informelle de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Il faut qu\u2019une conclusion de fait erron\u00e9e ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments dont la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t disposait.\n[18] Si je reconnais que, dans son avis d\u2019appel, l\u2019appelant dit se fonder sur les motifs autoris\u00e9s par le paragraphe 27(1.3), je suis convaincue que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance d\u2019\u00eatre accueilli. La Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour accorder la majeure partie de la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant; il en va de m\u00eame pour notre Cour. Ni dans son avis d\u2019appel ni dans son dossier de requ\u00eate l\u2019appelant n\u2019invoque de motif d\u2019appel qui satisfait aux exigences du paragraphe 27(1.3), de sorte que l\u2019appel aurait une chance d\u2019\u00eatre accueilli.\n(1) La demande de l\u2019appelant visant \u00e0 obtenir une certaine r\u00e9paration outrepassait la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t\n[19] La plupart des erreurs que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t aurait commises selon l\u2019appelant n\u2019ont rien \u00e0 voir avec le bien-fond\u00e9 des cotisations ou la d\u00e9cision de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t de rejeter l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ces cotisations. En fait, \u00e0 quelques exceptions pr\u00e8s (dont il sera question ci-dessous), les motifs d\u2019appel invoqu\u00e9s par l\u2019appelant se rapportent plut\u00f4t \u00e0 des diff\u00e9rends avec d\u2019autres acteurs gouvernementaux ou autorit\u00e9s publiques ou parapubliques \u2013 une municipalit\u00e9, un service de police, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation fonci\u00e8re des municipalit\u00e9s et le contr\u00f4leur des armes \u00e0 feu de l\u2019Ontario \u2013, ou \u00e0 son opposition \u00e0 des d\u00e9cisions d\u2019autres tribunaux ou organismes de r\u00e9glementation \u2013 la Cour de justice de l\u2019Ontario, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice de l\u2019Ontario, la Cour divisionnaire de l\u2019Ontario et le Barreau de l\u2019Ontario.\n[20] Comme il l\u2019a fait devant la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, l\u2019appelant demande une ordonnance exigeant que lui soit restitu\u00e9e la r\u00e9sidence saisie, des d\u00e9clarations selon lesquelles les mesures prises par la municipalit\u00e9 sont nulles, et des d\u00e9clarations selon lesquelles les dispositions de certaines lois ontariennes et f\u00e9d\u00e9rales sont incompatibles avec la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, partie I de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, annexe B, Loi de 1982 sur le Canada, 1982, ch. 11 (R.\u2010U.). Il affirme que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a commis une erreur en ne pronon\u00e7ant pas cette ordonnance et ces d\u00e9clarations lorsqu\u2019il y a comparu pour son appel.\n[21] La Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t et notre Cour n\u2019ont pas comp\u00e9tence pour accorder cette r\u00e9paration. La comp\u00e9tence de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t est d\u00e9finie dans la loi, en particulier \u00e0 l\u2019article 12 de la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, et elle est circonscrite : Bonnybrook Park Industrial Development Co. Ltd. c. Canada (Revenu national), 2018 CAF 136, par. 19.\n[22] La Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a comp\u00e9tence exclusive pour entendre les appels port\u00e9s devant elle sur les questions d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019application de lois dont la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C. 1985, ch. 1 (5e suppl.), dans la mesure o\u00f9 la loi en cause le pr\u00e9voit : Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, par. 12(1).\n[23] Lorsqu\u2019elle tranche un appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une cotisation, la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t ne peut qu\u2019annuler la cotisation, la modifier ou la d\u00e9f\u00e9rer au ministre pour nouvel examen et nouvelle cotisation : Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, par. 171(1). Ni la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t ni la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu n\u2019autorise la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 accorder la r\u00e9paration que l\u2019appelant reproche \u00e0 la Cour de ne pas lui avoir accord\u00e9e.\n[24] Dans les appels de d\u00e9cisions de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, les pouvoirs de notre Cour se limitent \u00e0 rejeter l\u2019appel, \u00e0 renvoyer l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t ou \u00e0 rendre la d\u00e9cision que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t aurait d\u00fb rendre : Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, al. 52c). \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t ne pouvait pas accorder la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie de la question, elle ne pourra pas plus le faire si notre Cour lui renvoyait l\u2019affaire. Notre Cour ne peut pas non plus l\u2019accorder en appel.\n(2) Les all\u00e9gations de l\u2019appelant concernant la d\u00e9cision de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des cotisations sont manifestement vou\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chec\n[25] Je passe maintenant aux parties de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel de l\u2019appelant qui all\u00e8guent que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a commis des erreurs susceptibles de se rapporter aux cotisations dont elle \u00e9tait saisie. Ces all\u00e9gations figurent aux paragraphes 7, 8, 9 et 10 de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel de l\u2019appelant, mais elles sont \u00e9galement r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es et d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es dans d\u2019autres parties de l\u2019avis.\n[26] La premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation veut que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t ait commis une erreur de droit en pr\u00e9sumant que le revenu et le revenu imposable de l\u2019appelant \u00e9taient identiques. La deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation veut que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t ait agi de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments dont elle disposait en affirmant que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait en mesure de produire une d\u00e9claration de revenus. Enfin, l\u2019appelant soutient que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a commis une erreur de droit en lui ordonnant de produire des d\u00e9clarations de revenus sans ses documents fiscaux.\n[27] Avant d\u2019examiner ces erreurs all\u00e9gu\u00e9es, il pourrait \u00eatre utile d\u2019expliquer le r\u00f4le des hypoth\u00e8ses du ministre.\n[28] Pour \u00e9tablir la cotisation du contribuable, le ministre pose certaines hypoth\u00e8ses. Les hypoth\u00e8ses sur lesquelles le ministre s\u2019est fond\u00e9 en \u00e9tablissant sa cotisation doivent \u00eatre indiqu\u00e9es dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel de l\u2019appelant devant la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t : R\u00e8gles de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (proc\u00e9dure informelle), DORS\/90-688b, al. 6(1)d). Pour avoir gain de cause devant la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, il incombe au contribuable de d\u00e9molir ces hypoth\u00e8ses (Lacroix c. Canada, 2008 CAF 241, par. 18; Hickman Motors Ltd. c. Canada, [1997] 2 R.C.S. 336, par. 92 et 93), ou d\u2019\u00e9tablir que, m\u00eame si elles sont vraies, elles n\u2019\u00e9tayent pas la cotisation faisant l\u2019objet de l\u2019appel.\n[29] Pour d\u00e9molir les hypoth\u00e8ses, le contribuable doit convaincre la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que les hypoth\u00e8ses sont erron\u00e9es, habituellement en pr\u00e9sentant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve utiles et cr\u00e9dibles \u00e0 cet effet. Si la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019est pas convaincue que les hypoth\u00e8ses de fait du ministre sont erron\u00e9es, elle doit les consid\u00e9rer comme vraies : Pollock c. Canada (ministre du Revenu national), [1993] A.C.F. no 1055, par. 21.\n[30] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, en l\u2019absence de d\u00e9clarations de l\u2019appelant, le ministre a pos\u00e9 des hypoth\u00e8ses concernant le montant des revenus que l\u2019appelant avait gagn\u00e9s sur la base de renseignements obtenus d\u2019autres sources. Le ministre a \u00e9galement pos\u00e9 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas produit de d\u00e9clarations pour les ann\u00e9es 2017, 2018 et 2019. Le ministre a \u00e9tabli les cotisations en se fondant sur ces revenus et impos\u00e9 des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s pour production tardive.\n[31] Dans ce contexte, je reviens aux trois erreurs qui, selon l\u2019appelant, auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 commises.\n[32] Je ne peux pas convenir que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que le revenu imposable et le revenu de l\u2019appelant \u00e9taient identiques. (En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je comprends des propos de l\u2019appelant qu\u2019il parle du \u00ab revenu net \u00bb et du \u00ab revenu brut \u00bb, respectivement, parce que la seule d\u00e9duction qu\u2019il a mentionn\u00e9e devant la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e9tait l\u2019amortissement \u2013 la d\u00e9duction pour amortissement \u00e0 des fins fiscales \u2013, qui est une d\u00e9duction dans le calcul du revenu, et non du revenu imposable.) L\u2019hypoth\u00e8se du ministre \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t que le revenu et le revenu net de l\u2019appelant \u00e9taient identiques. En d\u2019autres termes, le ministre a pos\u00e9 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se que l\u2019appelant touchait des revenus provenant de trois sources, pour les montants pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s. Le ministre a calcul\u00e9 l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 payer de l\u2019appelant en se fondant sur le fait que ces montants constituaient ses seuls revenus et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait aucune d\u00e9duction pour amortissement.\n[33] Devant la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, l\u2019appelant a admis avoir touch\u00e9 les types de revenu d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par le ministre. Bien qu\u2019il ne soit pas certain des montants, il n\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pour les contester. M\u00eame s\u2019il a affirm\u00e9 avoir droit \u00e0 un amortissement, la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a qualifi\u00e9 de peu [traduction] \u00ab convaincants \u00bb les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 ce sujet. En d\u2019autres termes, compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincue, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que les hypoth\u00e8ses du ministre concernant ses revenus ou les cotisations \u00e9tablies en se fondant sur ses revenus \u00e9taient erron\u00e9es.\n[34] Si l\u2019appelant croyait que les montants des revenus \u00e9taient erron\u00e9s, qu\u2019il avait un solde lui donnant droit \u00e0 une d\u00e9duction pour amortissement ou que d\u2019autres hypoth\u00e8ses de fait sur lesquelles les cotisations \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es \u00e9taient erron\u00e9es, il aurait d\u00fb pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve le d\u00e9montrant devant la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Un appel fond\u00e9 sur cette premi\u00e8re erreur all\u00e9gu\u00e9e n\u2019a aucune chance d\u2019\u00eatre accueilli.\n[35] Je me penche maintenant sur la deuxi\u00e8me erreur all\u00e9gu\u00e9e : la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t aurait agi de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments dont elle disposait en concluant que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait en mesure de produire une d\u00e9claration de revenus. Je constate d\u2019abord que l\u2019appelant a admis ne pas avoir produit de d\u00e9clarations de revenus pour les ann\u00e9es 2017, 2018 et 2019, et que le ministre lui avait demand\u00e9 de les produire.\n[36] Comme il est indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, l\u2019argument principal de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ses documents ou \u00e0 ses renseignements parce que sa r\u00e9sidence avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie ill\u00e9galement par la municipalit\u00e9, et qu\u2019il ne pouvait donc pas remplir ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus. Il a affirm\u00e9 que ces actes l\u2019ont priv\u00e9 de son droit de produire une d\u00e9claration de revenus.\n[37] La Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord.\n[38] La transcription montre clairement que, lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il ne pouvait pas obtenir les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires aupr\u00e8s d\u2019autres sources (y compris son ou ses anciens comptables, les payeurs de ses revenus ou ses d\u00e9clarations ant\u00e9rieures), l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait aucune r\u00e9ponse satisfaisante. Toutefois, m\u00eame si la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t avait pr\u00eat\u00e9 foi \u00e0 toutes les all\u00e9gations de l\u2019appelant au sujet des autres acteurs, elle n\u2019aurait pas pu accueillir l\u2019appel et annuler les cotisations.\n[39] Lorsqu\u2019une cotisation d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un appel devant la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, la seule question en litige devant la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t est la validit\u00e9 de la cotisation en fonction des dispositions applicables de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu : Main Rehabilitation Co. c. Canada, 2004 CAF 403, par. 8; Ereiser c. Canada, 2013 CAF 20, par. 31. Il est \u00ab bien \u00e9tabli que la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour annuler une cotisation \u00e9tablie sur la base d\u2019une conduite fautive du ministre \u00bb (Robertson c. Canada, 2017 CAF 168, par. 59) ou tout autre repr\u00e9sentant du gouvernement, et ce, m\u00eame si cette conduite est av\u00e9r\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une \u00ab conduite fautive [\u2026], tel un abus de pouvoir ou un manquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 \u00bb : Canada (Revenu national) c. JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc., 2013 CAF 250, par. 83, et la jurisprudence qui y est cit\u00e9e.\n[40] Par cons\u00e9quent, un appel fond\u00e9 sur le d\u00e9faut de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t de tenir compte des all\u00e9gations de l\u2019appelant concernant la saisie de sa r\u00e9sidence n\u2019a aucune chance d\u2019\u00eatre accueilli.\n[41] La troisi\u00e8me erreur all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t aurait ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de produire des d\u00e9clarations pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2020, 2021 et 2022. Bien que, dans ses motifs prononc\u00e9s oralement, la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t ait exhort\u00e9 l\u2019appelant \u00e0 produire ces d\u00e9clarations, elle ne lui a pas ordonn\u00e9 de le faire. L\u2019intention de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e9tait de toute \u00e9vidence d\u2019avertir l\u2019appelant que le d\u00e9faut de produire ces d\u00e9clarations pouvait entra\u00eener l\u2019imposition de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s pour d\u00e9faut de produire une d\u00e9claration. Il est important de souligner que le jugement de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019ordonne pas \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de produire des d\u00e9clarations de revenus; il ne fait que rejeter [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des cotisations \u00e9tablies en vertu de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2017, 2018 et 2019 [\u2026], sans d\u00e9pens \u00bb. Un appel all\u00e9guant que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a commis une erreur en rendant une ordonnance qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais rendue n\u2019a aucune chance d\u2019\u00eatre accueilli.\nC. Le jugement de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t portait-il sur les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition en cause?\n[42] Je dois examiner un dernier point. L\u2019avis d\u2019appel de l\u2019appelant d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t pr\u00e9tendait interjeter appel des cotisations de l\u2019appelant pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2012 \u00e0 2023. Toutefois, le jugement de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t ne portait manifestement que sur les cotisations pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2017, 2018 et 2019. Bien que l\u2019appelant all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une erreur, il ne peut interjeter appel de cotisations pour certaines ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition devant la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t simplement en les \u00e9num\u00e9rant dans son avis d\u2019appel.\n[43] Une cotisation ne peut faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un appel devant la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t qu\u2019apr\u00e8s qu\u2019un avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 cette cotisation a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada : Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, par. 169(1). De plus, le d\u00e9lai pour pr\u00e9senter une opposition est limit\u00e9 : Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, art. 165 et par. 166.1(1) et 166.2(1).\n[44] J\u2019ai lu attentivement la transcription de l\u2019instance devant la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, l\u2019avis d\u2019appel d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t et la r\u00e9ponse du ministre \u00e0 cet avis d\u2019appel. Je suis convaincue que les seules cotisations dont \u00e9tait d\u00fbment saisie la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e9taient les cotisations pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2017, 2018 et 2019. \u00c9videmment, la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t ne pouvait pas \u00eatre saisie des cotisations de l\u2019appelant pour les ann\u00e9es 2022 et 2023, puisqu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son avis d\u2019appel le 6 avril 2023.\n[45] Toutefois, m\u00eame si la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment saisie des cotisations pour les autres ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition mentionn\u00e9es dans son avis d\u2019appel, le jugement de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t ne rejette que les appels \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des cotisations pour les ann\u00e9es 2017, 2018 et 2019. Si la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment saisie de ces cotisations, la d\u00e9cision faisant l\u2019objet de l\u2019appel ne sugg\u00e8re nullement que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019en est pas encore saisie.\n[46] Par cons\u00e9quent, un appel fond\u00e9 sur le d\u00e9faut de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t d\u2019examiner les cotisations pour d\u2019autres ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition n\u2019a aucune chance d\u2019\u00eatre accueilli.\nIII. Conclusion\n[47] J\u2019ai lu attentivement la transcription et l\u2019avis d\u2019appel d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Comme l\u2019indique l\u2019intim\u00e9, [traduction] \u00ab [u]ne interpr\u00e9tation holistique et pratique de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 le bien-fond\u00e9 de la cotisation en cause \u00bb : observations \u00e9crites de l\u2019intim\u00e9, par. 10.\n[48] La plainte de l\u2019appelant devant la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t mettait plut\u00f4t l\u2019accent sur les actes d\u2019autres personnes, \u00e0 savoir sur son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle il n\u2019avait pas pu produire ses d\u00e9clarations parce que sa r\u00e9sidence avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie. Il demandait essentiellement \u00e0 la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t diverses ordonnances et d\u00e9clarations que la Cour ne pouvait pas prononcer, et que notre Cour ne peut donc pas prononcer en appel.\n[49] En conclusion, je suis convaincue que le pr\u00e9sent appel n\u2019a aucune chance d\u2019\u00eatre accueilli. Je suis \u00e9galement convaincue qu\u2019aucune modification \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel ne m\u00e8nerait \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019accueillerais la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et je rejetterais l\u2019appel, avec d\u00e9pens.\n\u00ab K.A.

Aper\u00e7u [1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision porte sur une requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelante, la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (le CN), visant \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance en sursis de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui fait l\u2019objet du pr\u00e9sent appel jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que notre Cour rende son jugement final relativement \u00e0 ce dernier.\n[2] Les intim\u00e9s le Canada (ministre de l\u2019Environnement) et le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada consentent \u00e0 la requ\u00eate du CN.\n[3] Les intim\u00e9es la municipalit\u00e9 r\u00e9gionale de Halton, la corporation de la ville de Milton, la corporation de la ville de Halton Hills, la corporation de la ville de Burlington, la corporation de la ville d\u2019Oakville et l\u2019Office de protection de la nature de la r\u00e9gion de Halton (les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton) s\u2019opposent \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. Fait important \u00e0 noter, le dossier de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate qu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 contient un affidavit du Dr Rakesh Singh qui traite des \u00e9missions provenant de v\u00e9hicules \u00e0 moteur qui r\u00e9sulteraient de l\u2019octroi du sursis.\n[4] Le CN a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un dossier en r\u00e9plique qui contient, outre ses observations \u00e9crites, un affidavit de Allan Prits qui r\u00e9pond \u00e0 l\u2019affidavit du Dr Singh. Ce dossier est accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019une lettre dans laquelle le CN reconna\u00eet ne pas avoir le droit de pr\u00e9senter de contre-preuve et sollicite l\u2019autorisation de la Cour \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton s\u2019opposent \u00e0 cette demande d\u2019autorisation, qui suscite une question distincte dont je traiterai avant de me pencher sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la requ\u00eate en sursis.\nII. Contexte [5] En 2021, \u00e0 la fin d\u2019un processus d\u2019approbation qui a dur\u00e9 six ans, le CN a d\u00e9but\u00e9 la construction d\u2019un vaste terminus sur un terrain qu\u2019il poss\u00e8de \u00e0 Milton, en Ontario, en vue de faciliter le transfert de conteneurs de taille normale (intermodale) entre ses wagons et des camions (le projet).\n[6] Les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de trois d\u00e9cisions qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019approbation du projet. Le 1er mars 2024, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (2024 CF 348, le juge Henry S. Brown) a accueilli la demande \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de deux des trois d\u00e9cisions, les annulant et renvoyant l\u2019affaire pour nouvelle d\u00e9cision. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a eu pour effet de suspendre les travaux de construction du projet par le CN.\n[7] Le CN a depuis interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en sursis.\nIII. Le crit\u00e8re juridique applicable en mati\u00e8re de sursis en attendant l\u2019issue de l\u2019appel [8] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(1)b) de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. (1985), ch. F-7, accorde \u00e0 notre Cour le pouvoir d\u2019accorder une suspension des proc\u00e9dures lorsque \u00ab l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice l\u2019exige \u00bb.

La Cour doit \u00eatre convaincue que l\u2019appel n\u2019est pas futile ou vexatoire : arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald, \u00e0 la p. 348.\n[11] En ce qui concerne le pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable, la partie requ\u00e9rante doit pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve clairs et non conjecturaux \u00e9tablissant, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu\u2019elle subira \u00ab un pr\u00e9judice qui ne peut \u00eatre quantifi\u00e9 du point de vue mon\u00e9taire ou un pr\u00e9judice auquel il ne peut \u00eatre rem\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00bb : arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald, \u00e0 la p. 341; Sheldon M.

Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a ajout\u00e9 les commentaires suivants \u00e0 la page 346 au sujet de l\u2019atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public :\nDans le cas d\u2019un organisme public, le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir le pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public est moins exigeant que pour un particulier en raison, en partie, de la nature m\u00eame de l\u2019organisme public et, en partie, de l\u2019action qu\u2019on veut faire interdire. On pourra presque toujours satisfaire au crit\u00e8re en \u00e9tablissant simplement que l\u2019organisme a le devoir de favoriser ou de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et en indiquant que c\u2019est dans cette sph\u00e8re de responsabilit\u00e9 que se situent le texte l\u00e9gislatif, le r\u00e8glement ou l\u2019activit\u00e9 contest\u00e9s. Si l\u2019on a satisfait \u00e0 ces exigences minimales, le tribunal devrait, dans la plupart des cas, supposer que l\u2019interdiction de l\u2019action causera un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\n[12] Pour ce qui est du crit\u00e8re de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients, il s\u2019agit de \u00ab d\u00e9terminer laquelle des deux parties subira le plus grand pr\u00e9judice selon que l\u2019on accorde ou refuse une injonction interlocutoire en attendant une d\u00e9cision sur le fond \u00bb : arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald, \u00e0 la p. 342.\nIV. La contre-preuve par affidavit [13] Comme j\u2019y ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait allusion, je ne peux me pencher sur la r\u00e9plique du CN avant d\u2019avoir tranch\u00e9 la question litigieuse que suscite son contenu.\n[14] Les parties conviennent que l\u2019arr\u00eat Amgen Canada Inc. c. Apotex Inc., 2016 CAF 121, 266 A.C.W.S. (3d) 12, est pertinent en ce qui concerne la question de la contre-preuve qui peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 une requ\u00eate. Les R\u00e8gles ne contiennent aucune disposition quant au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une contre-preuve relativement \u00e0 une requ\u00eate. Cela dit, les cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales ont le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019admettre une telle preuve en raison de ce qui suit :\nL\u2019article 55 des R\u00e8gles permet de modifier une r\u00e8gle dans des circonstances sp\u00e9ciales;\nL\u2019article 3 dispose que les R\u00e8gles sont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es et appliqu\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 permettre une solution au litige qui soit juste et la plus exp\u00e9ditive et \u00e9conomique possible;\nL\u2019article 4, appel\u00e9 souvent la r\u00e8gle des lacunes, permet de d\u00e9terminer la proc\u00e9dure applicable par analogie avec d\u2019autres r\u00e8gles en cas de silence des R\u00e8gles (l\u2019article 312, qui permet de d\u00e9poser des affidavits compl\u00e9mentaires dans le contexte d\u2019une demande, peut \u00eatre une source d\u2019inspiration);\nLe pouvoir inh\u00e9rent des cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales de fixer leurs r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure.\n[15] Le CN reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il doit \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de circonstances inhabituelles afin de pouvoir pr\u00e9senter une contre-preuve. Les consid\u00e9rations pertinentes \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sont l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et l\u2019obligation de rendre une d\u00e9cision convenable.\n[16] Le CN fait valoir que la Cour doit prendre en consid\u00e9ration sa contre-preuve, l\u2019affidavit de M. Prits, car en affirmant dans son affidavit que la poursuite des travaux de construction du projet susciterait des risques importants sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, le Dr Singh se fonde sur une mod\u00e9lisation d\u00e9su\u00e8te et des fausses donn\u00e9es quant \u00e0 l\u2019effet des \u00e9missions sur la sant\u00e9 humaine. Le CN avance \u00e9galement qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas avoir raisonnablement anticip\u00e9 que les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton pr\u00e9senteraient des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au sujet de telles pr\u00e9occupations.\n[17] Les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton affirment en r\u00e9ponse que le CN n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence de circonstances inhabituelles. Ils font valoir que le CN ne peut \u00e9tablir que l\u2019affidavit du Dr Singh (qui traite des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9fastes de la reprise des travaux de construction du projet) soul\u00e8ve de nouvelles questions, car l\u2019objet de la requ\u00eate du CN est la reprise des travaux de construction.\n[18] Je suis d\u2019accord avec les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton. Il est vrai que le CN n\u2019\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre pas en mesure d\u2019anticiper la nature exacte de la preuve que les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton pr\u00e9senteraient en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate en sursis, mais il aurait d\u00fb s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que ces derniers pr\u00e9sentent une preuve quelconque au sujet de l\u2019effet sur l\u2019environnement de la reprise des travaux de construction du projet, notamment les \u00e9missions en d\u00e9coulant. Or, le CN a choisi de ne pas pr\u00e9senter de preuve principale \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard; il a plut\u00f4t d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se fonder sur l\u2019argument selon lequel, pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de la proc\u00e9dure en contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton ont agi d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui laissait entendre qu\u2019ils n\u2019estimaient pas que les \u00e9missions d\u00e9coulant des travaux de construction soulevaient une question importante. En outre, en ce qui concerne l\u2019argument du CN selon lequel le Dr Singh s\u2019\u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur des renseignements p\u00e9rim\u00e9s, ils peuvent faire valoir leur point de vue sur cette question \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape des plaidoiries; ils n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 renvoyer \u00e0 de la contre-preuve.\n[19] Je rendrai une ordonnance en vertu de laquelle le CN pourra pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e9crites en r\u00e9plique (conjointement avec le recueil de jurisprudence et de doctrine et la preuve de signification), mais j\u2019exclurai l\u2019affidavit de M. Prits. Heureusement, les observations \u00e9crites que le CN a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en r\u00e9plique indiquent clairement la partie de celles-ci qui se rapporte \u00e0 cet affidavit. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de demander au CN de pr\u00e9senter en r\u00e9plique des observations \u00e9crites modifi\u00e9es. J\u2019examinerai ces observations en faisant abstraction de leur paragraphe 36.\nV. Analyse A. Question s\u00e9rieuse [20] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la pr\u00e9sente instance se rapporte \u00e0 l\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, la norme de contr\u00f4le que notre Cour doit appliquer est celle d\u00e9crite dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Agraira c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2013 CSC 36, [2013] 2 R.C.S. 559, au para. 45. La Cour doit donc d\u00e9terminer (i) si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a choisi la ou les normes de contr\u00f4le qu\u2019il convenait d\u2019appliquer aux d\u00e9cisions contest\u00e9es, et (ii) si la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a correctement appliqu\u00e9 la ou les normes en question. La Cour devra donc se mettre \u00e0 la place de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et axer son intervention sur les d\u00e9cisions administratives en cause.\n[21] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a choisi la norme de contr\u00f4le de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable et conclu que les deux d\u00e9cisions en cause dans le pr\u00e9sent appel \u00e9taient d\u00e9raisonnables. \u00c0 moins que l\u2019une des parties s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019application de la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable, il incombera \u00e0 la Cour de d\u00e9terminer si ces d\u00e9cisions \u00e9taient en effet d\u00e9raisonnables.\n[22] Vu le fardeau peu exigeant \u00e0 remplir pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une question s\u00e9rieuse et compte tenu des questions soulev\u00e9es dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et du fait que la Cour doit faire preuve de retenue en appliquant la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable, je suis convaincu que le CN a satisfait \u00e0 cette partie du crit\u00e8re applicable en mati\u00e8re de sursis.\nB. Pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable [23] Le CN soutient qu\u2019il subira un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable si sa demande de sursis n\u2019est pas accueillie. Il fait \u00e9galement valoir que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public subira \u00e9galement un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable.\n[24] Le CN fait valoir qu\u2019il devra verser des sommes qu\u2019il ne pourra pas r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer pour faire ce qui suit : (i) pr\u00e9parer la fermeture du chantier, (ii) surveiller le chantier durant sa fermeture, (iii) prot\u00e9ger le chantier sur le plan environnemental durant ce temps, et (iv) dans le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019appel est accueilli, pr\u00e9parer la reprise des travaux. Le CN avance \u00e9galement qu\u2019il subira des pertes irr\u00e9cup\u00e9rables en raison du retard dans les travaux.\n[25] S\u2019agissant de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, la CN mentionne le pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable que causera le retard dans les travaux de finalisation du projet tel qu\u2019approuv\u00e9 par les autorit\u00e9s publiques dans les d\u00e9cisions contest\u00e9es.\n[26] Les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton contestent la qualit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le CN au sujet du pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable sur le plan financier qu\u2019il subira si sa demande de sursis ne lui est pas accord\u00e9e. Peu importe la qualit\u00e9 de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, je peux difficilement imaginer que le CN ne subira pas un quelconque pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable. Bien qu\u2019il soit raisonnable de prendre soigneusement en consid\u00e9ration les sommes en jeu all\u00e9gu\u00e9es par le CN, il me semble clair que ce dernier devra verser des sommes au titre de chaque cat\u00e9gorie mentionn\u00e9e au paragraphe 24 et qu\u2019il ne pourra pas r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer celles-ci.\n[27] Les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton font valoir que le CN a poursuivi ses travaux jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent malgr\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, il \u00e9tait responsable des sommes qu\u2019il avait vers\u00e9es \u00e0 ce titre. Les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton soutiennent que le CN aurait pu \u00e9viter de verser ces sommes et que celles-ci n\u2019\u00e9taient donc pas irr\u00e9cup\u00e9rables.\n[28] J\u2019h\u00e9siter \u00e0 critiquer le CN pour avoir lanc\u00e9 les travaux de construction du projet malgr\u00e9 les proc\u00e9dures judiciaires en cours, car il avait obtenu les approbations gouvernementales n\u00e9cessaires au terme de six ann\u00e9es d\u2019efforts \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il a certes pris le risque que la demande en contr\u00f4le judiciaire soit accueillie, mais cela n\u2019emp\u00eache pas le fait qu\u2019il subisse un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable si sa demande de sursis n\u2019est pas accueillie, m\u00eame s\u2019il a gain de cause en appel.\nC. Pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients [29] Les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton soutiennent que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients est d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 l\u2019octroi d\u2019un sursis. Ils avancent notamment ce qui suit :\nLe CN n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 des \u00e9missions qui r\u00e9sulteraient de la poursuite des travaux de construction du projet dans les documents qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, et de telles \u00e9missions seraient consid\u00e9rables;\nLa demande \u00e0 laquelle les installations intermodales suppl\u00e9mentaires que le projet offrirait sont appel\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre est plus faible que ce que pr\u00e9tend le CN;\nLe CN est une grande soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui agit dans son propre int\u00e9r\u00eat et le maintien de la suspension des travaux en attendant l\u2019issue de son appel aurait un effet n\u00e9gligeable et strictement financier sur ses affaires;\nL\u2019argument du CN selon lequel il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public d\u2019accueillir sa demande de sursis est conjectural et non \u00e9tay\u00e9.\n(1) \u00c9missions r\u00e9sultant des travaux [30] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, en ce qui concerne les \u00e9missions r\u00e9sultant de la poursuite des travaux de construction du projet, les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton se sont fond\u00e9s sur le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Singh, qui a analys\u00e9 les effets de telles \u00e9missions en se fondant sur l\u2019\u00e9tude d\u2019impact environnemental de 2015 que le CN a soumis \u00e0 la commission d\u2019examen d\u2019\u00e9valuation environnementale (la commission), dont le mandat \u00e9tait d\u2019examiner le bien-fond\u00e9 du projet.\n[31] Dans les observations \u00e9crites qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en r\u00e9plique, le CN fait remarquer que les donn\u00e9es mentionn\u00e9es dans l\u2019\u00e9tude d\u2019impact environnemental de 2015 \u00e9taient p\u00e9rim\u00e9es et que la commission s\u2019est plut\u00f4t fond\u00e9e sur des donn\u00e9es et une mod\u00e9lisation \u00e0 jour. La commission et l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de d\u00e9cision qui a suivi imposaient \u00e9galement des mesures d\u2019att\u00e9nuation en mati\u00e8re de qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019air qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas mentionn\u00e9es dans l\u2019\u00e9tude de 2015. Par ailleurs, le CN ajoute que les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton savent que les donn\u00e9es mentionn\u00e9es dans l\u2019\u00e9tude de 2015 sont p\u00e9rim\u00e9es. En outre, le CN conteste le fait que le Dr Singh a mis l\u2019accent sur l\u2019ensemble des \u00e9missions sans fournir de renseignements sur la fa\u00e7on dont elles se disperseraient dans l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re. Or, de tels renseignements seraient utiles afin d\u2019appr\u00e9cier le niveau d\u2019exposition des humains aux \u00e9missions.\n[32] Les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton soutiennent que l\u2019omission du CN de traiter des \u00e9missions qui r\u00e9sultent des travaux de construction du projet est [TRADUCTION] \u00ab hautement incongrue \u00bb. Pour ma part, je ne trouve pas que cette omission est incongrue. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 18, le CN explique pourquoi il n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 de cette cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019\u00e9missions, faisant valoir que le comportement des intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de la proc\u00e9dure en contr\u00f4le judiciaire laissait entendre qu\u2019ils se pr\u00e9occupaient relativement peu des \u00e9missions r\u00e9sultant des travaux. En fait, le CN demande \u00e0 notre Cour de d\u00e9duire ce manque de pr\u00e9occupation du fait de l\u2019omission des intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton de chercher \u00e0 obtenir la suspension des travaux de construction du projet au cours de la p\u00e9riode de trois ans qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9e entre le moment o\u00f9 la demande en contr\u00f4le judiciaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et celui o\u00f9 cette derni\u00e8re a rendu sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[33] Je suis d\u2019accord avec le CN que le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Singh est principalement fond\u00e9 sur les donn\u00e9es mentionn\u00e9es dans l\u2019\u00e9tude d\u2019impact environnemental de 2015 et que ces donn\u00e9es semblent p\u00e9rim\u00e9es. Je reconnais que la reprise des travaux de construction du projet entra\u00eenera une augmentation des \u00e9missions si la demande de sursis est accueillie, mais je ne dispose pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve fiables quant \u00e0 l\u2019importance des effets dommageables de telles \u00e9missions. Je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure que les \u00e9missions r\u00e9sultant des travaux n\u2019\u00e9taient pas la priorit\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton lors du d\u00e9roulement de la proc\u00e9dure en contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. En effet, ils n\u2019ont pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 suspendre les travaux en attendant l\u2019issue de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et ils n\u2019ont pas non plus cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer la proc\u00e9dure.\n(2) Demande \u00e0 laquelle les installations intermodales doivent r\u00e9pondre [34] Je traiterai maintenant de l\u2019argument des intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton selon lequel la demande \u00e0 laquelle un tel projet doit r\u00e9pondre est plus faible que ce que pr\u00e9tend le CN. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton se fondent sur l\u2019affidavit de John Vickerman, qui a remis en question les donn\u00e9es fournies par le t\u00e9moin du CN Darren Reynolds au sujet de la capacit\u00e9 des installations intermodales existantes de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande future. Les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton soutiennent que les volumes de transport intermodal de marchandises sont en fait \u00e0 la baisse et que les pr\u00e9visions du CN \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sont fond\u00e9es sur des donn\u00e9es p\u00e9rim\u00e9es. Ils soutiennent que le volume du fret transport\u00e9 par les chemins de fer au Canada a subi une baisse de 8,5 % de janvier 2023 \u00e0 janvier 2024.\n[35] En r\u00e9plique, le CN fait remarquer que ses donn\u00e9es sont plus fiables, car elles se rapportent pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment aux affaires du CN et sont davantage compatibles avec les conclusions de la commission. \u00c0 la page 288 de son rapport dat\u00e9 du 27 janvier 2020, la commission a fait la remarque suivante :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLa commission estime que le CN, les autorit\u00e9s portuaires, les compagnies de transport et d\u2019autres intervenants dans la gestion de la cha\u00eene d\u2019approvisionnement ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on convaincante que tant et aussi longtemps que les taux de croissance actuels se maintiendront, il faudra augmenter la capacit\u00e9 intermodale des terminus dans la r\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto et d\u2019Hamilton.\n[36] Je suis d\u2019accord avec le CN que je devrais accorder davantage de poids \u00e0 sa preuve, qui est compatible avec les conclusions de la commission, qu\u2019\u00e0 celle des intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton, qui laisse entendre que, non seulement la demande \u00e0 laquelle les installations intermodales sont appel\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre ne cro\u00eet pas au taux pr\u00e9vu par le CN, mais qu\u2019en fait elle est \u00e0 la baisse. Je doute que la demande \u00e0 laquelle le projet est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre soit \u00e0 la baisse \u00e0 moyen ou \u00e0 long terme. \u00c0 mon avis, le CN et la commission sont mieux plac\u00e9s que les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton pour appr\u00e9cier la demande \u00e0 laquelle les installations intermodales doivent r\u00e9pondre.\n(3) Cons\u00e9quences du rejet de la demande de sursis du CN [37] Les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton soutiennent que la suspension des travaux de construction du projet en attendant l\u2019issue de l\u2019appel n\u2019aura aucun effet sur la viabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme du CN, la part de march\u00e9 de celui-ci et sa r\u00e9putation sur le plan des affaires. Ils avancent que, m\u00eame si le CN subissait un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable en cas de rejet de sa demande de sursis, cela ne constituerait pas un risque existentiel. Enfin, les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton font \u00e9galement valoir que la Cour ne devrait pas consid\u00e9rer que le CN agit de fa\u00e7on autre que dans son propre int\u00e9r\u00eat.\n[38] J\u2019accepte les arguments des intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton. Cependant, ils ne changent rien au fait que les organismes gouvernementaux charg\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9valuer le projet du point de vue de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public ont accord\u00e9 au CN l\u2019autorisation de r\u00e9aliser le projet. Compte tenu de cela, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il semble \u00eatre dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public d\u2019accueillir la demande de sursis afin que les travaux de construction du projet puissent se poursuivre.\n(4) La question de savoir si les observations du CN au sujet de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public sont conjecturales et non \u00e9tay\u00e9es [39] Les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton contestent les arguments du CN selon lesquels tout retard suppl\u00e9mentaire dans la construction du projet ira \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Ils contestent la preuve du CN \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[40] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, les organismes gouvernementaux charg\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9valuer le projet ont conclu que ce dernier \u00e9tait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public apr\u00e8s avoir soupes\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve favorables et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9favorables au projet. Malgr\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019accueillir la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve convaincants d\u00e9montrent que le projet est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. En outre, il va de soi, selon moi, que tout retard dans les travaux de construction d\u2019un projet qui est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de celui-ci.\n(5) Conclusion quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients [41] La reprise des travaux de construction du projet produira certainement des effets n\u00e9gatifs si la demande de sursis est accueillie, dans le cas o\u00f9 le pr\u00e9sent appel est \u00e9ventuellement rejet\u00e9. Le principal effet n\u00e9gatif est l\u2019augmentation des \u00e9missions qui r\u00e9sultera des travaux. Une telle augmentation aura clairement un effet sur la population qui se trouve pr\u00e8s du projet, bien que l\u2019ampleur de cet effet ne soit pas tr\u00e8s claire.\n[42] Or, il convient de soupeser les effets n\u00e9gatifs que l\u2019octroi du sursis entra\u00eenerait en prenant en consid\u00e9ration les effets n\u00e9gatifs du refus d\u2019accorder le sursis. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, ces effets comprennent les mesures qu\u2019il faudra n\u00e9cessairement prendre pour suspendre les travaux de construction et \u00e9ventuellement les relancer plus tard dans le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019appel est accueilli. En outre, il semble \u00eatre dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public que le projet soit r\u00e9alis\u00e9, et ce avec le moins de retard possible.\n[43] \u00c0 mon avis, la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients favorise l\u2019octroi du sursis. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les intim\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion de Halton au sujet des \u00e9missions provenant des travaux de construction semblent p\u00e9rim\u00e9s. La commission a pris en consid\u00e9ration des renseignements plus r\u00e9cents lorsqu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 son rapport, lequel a men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019autorisation de r\u00e9aliser le projet. Les co\u00fbts que la suspension des travaux imposera au CN et surtout le fait qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public que le projet soit r\u00e9alis\u00e9 semblent l\u2019emporter sur les effets n\u00e9gatifs des \u00e9missions r\u00e9sultant des travaux de construction de ce dernier.\nVI. Conclusion [44] Je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir la requ\u00eate du CN visant \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance en sursis de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui fait l\u2019objet du pr\u00e9sent appel jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que notre Cour rende son jugement final relativement \u00e0 ce dernier. Les d\u00e9pens relatifs \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate suivront l\u2019issue de la cause.\n\u00ab George R.

Les conseill\u00e8res Bellegarde et Haywahe contestent leur destitution par voie de demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L\u2019audience sur les demandes a eu lieu, mais la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas encore publi\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision.\n[3] Le 27 janvier 2023, les conseill\u00e8res Bellegarde et Haywahe ont obtenu une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (du juge Grammond) suspendant leur destitution ainsi que l\u2019\u00e9lection partielle pr\u00e9vue en vue de pourvoir leurs si\u00e8ges jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire soient tranch\u00e9es : 2023 CF 129. Aucun appel n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9 contre l\u2019ordonnance de suspension.\n[4] L\u2019\u00e9lection partielle a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue en d\u00e9pit de l\u2019ordonnance de suspension; Brady O\u2019Watch et Morris Pasap ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lus conseillers. Les conseill\u00e8res Bellegarde et Haywahe ont alors saisi la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire reconna\u00eetre l\u2019appelante, le chef Scott Eashappie, et les conseillers Shawn Spencer et Tamara Thomson, ainsi que Brady O\u2019Watch et Morris Pasap, coupables d\u2019outrage au regard de l\u2019ordonnance de suspension. (Dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, j\u2019appelle les conseill\u00e8res Bellegarde et Haywahe par leur titre de conseill\u00e8res, mais n\u2019utilise pas ce titre pour messieurs O\u2019Watch et Pasap, dont le statut fera l\u2019objet de la d\u00e9cision sur les demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire sous-jacentes.)\n[5] Le 15 janvier 2024, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a reconnu l\u2019appelante, le chef Eashappie et les conseillers Spencer et Thomson (ensemble, les contrevenants), mais non messieurs O\u2019Watch et Pasap, coupables d\u2019outrage au regard de l\u2019ordonnance de suspension. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ordonn\u00e9 que l\u2019affaire soit renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019administrateur judiciaire afin qu\u2019il fixe une date pour l\u2019audience de d\u00e9termination de la peine. L\u2019audience n\u2019a pas encore eu lieu.\n[6] La conseill\u00e8re Musqua a saisi notre Cour d\u2019un appel contre sa d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 d\u2019outrage. Les autres contrevenants ne l\u2019ont pas fait. La conseill\u00e8re Musqua demande par la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate qu\u2019il soit sursis \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de la peine jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019appel sur sa d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 soit tranch\u00e9.

Le crit\u00e8re applicable \u00e0 l\u2019octroi d\u2019un sursis \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald. La partie requ\u00e9rante doit \u00e9tablir : 1) que son appel soul\u00e8ve une question s\u00e9rieuse; 2) qu\u2019elle subira un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable en cas de refus du sursis; et 3) que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients favorise l\u2019octroi du sursis : RJR-MacDonald, p. 334; Canada c. Conseil canadien pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, 2008 CAF 40 au para. 18. Pour qu\u2019un sursis soit accord\u00e9, les trois crit\u00e8res doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9unis.\n[9] Le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 satisfaire pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019une question est importante n\u2019est pas rigoureux : RJR-MacDonald, p. 335; Western Oilfield Equipment Rentals Ltd. c. M-I L.L.C., 2020 CAF 3 au para. 8. Il suffit qu\u2019il existe au moins une question litigieuse en appel qui ne soit \u00ab ni futile ni vexatoire \u00bb : RJR-MacDonald, p. 337; Toronto Real Estate Board c. Commissaire de la concurrence, 2016 CAF 204 au para. 11; Conseil canadien pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s au para. 22.\n[10] La conseill\u00e8re Musqua affirme que son appel soul\u00e8ve plusieurs questions s\u00e9rieuses, notamment celle de savoir si la preuve de l\u2019outrage r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 la norme de la preuve \u00ab hors de tout doute raisonnable \u00bb et si le juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait tenu compte d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ne s\u2019appliquant pas \u00e0 son cas et avait ignor\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve applicables \u00e0 son cas. Elle fait \u00e9galement valoir que son avocat a offert une repr\u00e9sentation inefficace et que le juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a err\u00e9 en refusant la r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019instance sur l\u2019outrage.\n[11] Pour l\u2019essentiel, les intim\u00e9es soutiennent que l\u2019appel de la conseill\u00e8re Musqua est d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de fondement. Toutefois, dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate en sursis d\u2019ex\u00e9cution, l\u2019avis de la Cour sur les chances de succ\u00e8s de l\u2019appel n\u2019est pas pertinent : RJR-MacDonald, p. 338; Western Oilfield au para. 8.\n[12] \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, la question est de savoir si la conseill\u00e8re Musqua a soulev\u00e9 au moins une question en appel qui n\u2019est ni futile ni vexatoire. Je suis convaincue qu\u2019elle a atteint ce seuil peu \u00e9lev\u00e9. L\u2019appel satisfait au volet \u00ab question s\u00e9rieuse \u00bb du crit\u00e8re.\n[13] \u00c0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald, la conseill\u00e8re Musqua doit \u00e9tablir qu\u2019elle subirait un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable si le sursis n\u2019\u00e9tait pas accord\u00e9. Le terme \u00ab irr\u00e9parable \u00bb a trait \u00e0 la nature du pr\u00e9judice subi plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 son \u00e9tendue. C\u2019est un pr\u00e9judice qui ne peut \u00eatre quantifi\u00e9 du point de vue mon\u00e9taire ou un pr\u00e9judice auquel il ne peut \u00eatre rem\u00e9di\u00e9 sous forme d\u2019un d\u00e9dommagement : RJR-MacDonald, p. 341.\n[14] Bien que le pr\u00e9judice all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une analyse selon le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald soit n\u00e9cessairement futur, il ne saurait \u00eatre \u00ab hypoth\u00e9tique et conjectural \u00bb : Janssen Inc. c. Abbvie Corporation, 2014 CAF 112 au para. 24. Il doit y avoir une \u00ab une forte probabilit\u00e9 \u00bb que, faute de sursis, un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable soit in\u00e9vitablement caus\u00e9 : Bell Canada c. Beanfield Technologies Inc., 2024 CAF 28 au para. 21, et les d\u00e9cisions qui y sont cit\u00e9es.\n[15] La conseill\u00e8re Musqua soutient que l\u2019audience de d\u00e9termination de la peine entra\u00eenerait un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable en raison des sanctions graves susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre impos\u00e9es en cas d\u2019outrage, dont une peine de prison, lesquelles sont susceptibles d\u2019entraver ses moyens de subsistance et de porter atteinte \u00e0 ses libert\u00e9s civiles. Elle fait \u00e9galement valoir que l\u2019audience de d\u00e9termination de la peine causerait un pr\u00e9judice suppl\u00e9mentaire et irr\u00e9parable \u00e0 sa r\u00e9putation.\n[16] Je ne retiens pas ces pr\u00e9tentions. Je ne suis pas en mesure de conclure que l\u2019audience de d\u00e9termination de la peine elle-m\u00eame causerait \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation de la conseill\u00e8re Musqua un pr\u00e9judice additionnel \u00e0 celui r\u00e9sultant de la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 d\u2019outrage prononc\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. En outre, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l\u2019argument voulant que la simple possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une peine de prison constitue un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable.\n[17] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de choisir parmi un large \u00e9ventail de sanctions imposables \u00e0 une personne reconnue coupable d\u2019outrage. Ces sanctions sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 la R\u00e8gle 472 des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et comprennent une incarc\u00e9ration (R\u00e8gle 472 a) et b)), une amende (R\u00e8gle 472 c)), une ordonnance de s\u2019abstenir d\u2019accomplir un acte (R\u00e8gle 472 d)) et une condamnation aux d\u00e9pens (R\u00e8gle 472 f)). En d\u00e9finitive, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale doit \u00e9tablir une peine proportionnelle aux circonstances : Institut professionnel de la fonction publique du Canada c. Bremsak, 2013 CAF 214 aux para. 29 et 33. Dans certains cas, un avertissement, accompagn\u00e9 des reproches faits dans les motifs du jugement, suffit. Certaines de ces sanctions ne constitueraient pas un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable.\n[18] Il m\u2019est impossible de savoir quel pr\u00e9judice subira la conseill\u00e8re Musqua \u2013 et par cons\u00e9quent de d\u00e9terminer si ce pr\u00e9judice est irr\u00e9parable \u2013 avant que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de la sanction qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019imposer. La Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario a statu\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sabourin and Sun Group of Companies v. Laiken, 2011 ONCA 757 en concluant que la requ\u00eate en sursis d\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une ordonnance pour outrage pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e avant l\u2019audience de d\u00e9termination de la peine \u00e9tait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e : Sabourin au para. 7. La Cour n\u2019a pas souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019argument selon lequel le seul risque d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration constituait un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable : Sabourin au para. 13.\n[19] M\u00eame si j\u2019admettais que le risque d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration pouvait constituer un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable, ce pr\u00e9judice est potentiellement \u00e9vitable. Si, \u00e0 l\u2019audience de d\u00e9termination de la peine, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ordonnait l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration de la conseill\u00e8re Musqua, cette derni\u00e8re pourrait imm\u00e9diatement en appeler devant notre Cour et demander un sursis d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la peine. Notre Cour pourrait alors \u00e9valuer le bien-fond\u00e9 de la demande de sursis d\u2019ex\u00e9cution \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re d\u2019un portrait complet du pr\u00e9judice que subirait la conseill\u00e8re Musqua, comme recommand\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sabourin, par. 13. Il est \u00e9galement possible pour la conseill\u00e8re Musqua de demander \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019ajourner son audience de d\u00e9termination de la peine jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019appel soit entendu : Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Oshkosh Defense Canada Inc., 2018 CAF 102 au para. 24; Hama c. Werbes, 1999 BCCA 714 au para. 3.\n[20] \u00c0 ce stade, le pr\u00e9judice all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la conseill\u00e8re Musqua est hypoth\u00e9tique, conjectural et \u00e9vitable. Il n\u2019est pas satisfait au volet \u00ab pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable \u00bb du crit\u00e8re applicable \u00e0 l\u2019octroi d\u2019un sursis d\u2019ex\u00e9cution.\n[21] La troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald, la \u00ab balance des inconv\u00e9nients \u00bb, suppose de comparer le pr\u00e9judice que causerait \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e l\u2019octroi du sursis d\u2019ex\u00e9cution au pr\u00e9judice que causerait \u00e0 la partie requ\u00e9rante le refus du sursis, dans l\u2019attente de la d\u00e9cision sur le fonds : RJR-MacDonald, p. 342; Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration) c. Conseil canadien pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, 2020 CAF 181 au para. 10. Les volets du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-MacDonald \u00e9tant cumulatifs et la conseill\u00e8re Musqua n\u2019ayant pas satisfait \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du crit\u00e8re, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que j\u2019examine la balance des inconv\u00e9nients : Janssen au para. 14; Western Oilfield au para. 7.\n[22] En tout \u00e9tat de cause, dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je serais r\u00e9ticente \u00e0 intervenir dans l\u2019instance pour outrage devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, laquelle ne prend fin qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9termination d\u2019une sanction. Bien que la Cour ait le pouvoir d\u2019ordonner un sursis, il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de ne pas interrompre l\u2019instance devant la juridiction de premi\u00e8re instance lorsqu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulterait une fragmentation des appels : Sabourin, au para. 7; Hama au para. 3. Bien qu\u2019elle soit \u00e9tablie lors d\u2019une audience distincte, la sanction pour outrage atteste de la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019outrage de l\u2019avis de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, lequel avis pourrait \u00eatre pertinent \u00e0 la pleine appr\u00e9ciation par notre Cour de l\u2019affaire en appel.\n[23] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la requ\u00eate en sursis d\u2019ex\u00e9cution est rejet\u00e9e, avec l\u2019adjudication d\u2019une somme globale \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9pens, fix\u00e9s \u00e0 2 500 $.\n\u00ab Monica Biringer \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDossier :\nA-29-24\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nLUCY MUSQUA c.

R\u00e9sum\u00e9\n[1] Les appelants interjettent appel d\u2019un jugement rendu par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans lequel elle rejette deux demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire (2021 CF 1367 [jugement de la CF]). La premi\u00e8re portait sur la validit\u00e9 d\u2019un rapport r\u00e9dig\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019une \u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale effectu\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019impact, L.C. 2019, ch. 28 (la Loi), \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un projet de forage de puits d\u2019exploration extrac\u00f4tiers p\u00e9troliers et gaziers. La seconde avait pour objet l\u2019annulation d\u2019un r\u00e8glement pris en vertu de la Loi et ayant pour effet d\u2019exempter certaines activit\u00e9s relatives au forage de puits d\u2019exploration de conditions li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019impact.\n[2] Apr\u00e8s la tenue de l\u2019audience dans le pr\u00e9sent appel, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la Loi (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Loi sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019impact, 2023 CSC 23 [le Renvoi]). Selon la Cour supr\u00eame, le r\u00e9gime f\u00e9d\u00e9ral d\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019impact, qui est constitu\u00e9 de la Loi et de son R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s concr\u00e8tes, DORS\/2019-285 (le R\u00e8glement), est inconstitutionnel en partie.\n[3] Pour les motifs qui suivent et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du Renvoi, je rejetterais l\u2019appel.\nII. Gen\u00e8se de l\u2019instance\nA. Cadre l\u00e9gislatif\n[4] Le Renvoi pr\u00e9sente une analyse exhaustive du r\u00e9gime f\u00e9d\u00e9ral d\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019impact constitu\u00e9 de la Loi et du R\u00e8glement. Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 qui suit souligne les dispositions qui int\u00e9ressent le pr\u00e9sent appel. \u00c0 moins d\u2019indication contraire, les dispositions mentionn\u00e9es se trouvent dans la Loi. Par souci de commodit\u00e9, les dispositions l\u00e9gales pertinentes sont reproduites \u00e0 l\u2019annexe des pr\u00e9sents motifs.\n[5] La Loi et le R\u00e8glement font partie d\u2019un r\u00e9gime de r\u00e8glementation ayant pour objet l\u2019\u00e9valuation des effets n\u00e9gatifs d\u2019activit\u00e9s concr\u00e8tes sur l\u2019environnement ou sur les conditions sanitaires, sociales ou \u00e9conomiques et leurs r\u00e9percussions ainsi que la protection contre de tels effets. Ce r\u00e9gime a aussi pour objet (1) de favoriser la durabilit\u00e9; (2) de veiller au respect des droits des peuples autochtones; (3) de mettre en place un processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019impact \u00e9quitable, pr\u00e9visible et efficace qui cr\u00e9e des possibilit\u00e9s de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique durable; (4) de veiller \u00e0 ce que les \u00e9valuations d\u2019impact prennent en compte l\u2019information scientifique, les connaissances autochtones et d\u2019autres sources; et (5) d\u2019\u00e9valuer les effets cumulatifs dans une r\u00e9gion (pr\u00e9ambule, article 6).\n(1) Projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s\n[6] Pour pr\u00e9venir les effets n\u00e9gatifs d\u2019une activit\u00e9 concr\u00e8te, il est notamment possible de \u00ab d\u00e9signer \u00bb une activit\u00e9 concr\u00e8te (projet d\u00e9sign\u00e9), soit en application du R\u00e8glement, soit par arr\u00eat\u00e9 minist\u00e9riel (voir l\u2019art. 2, para. 9(1) et l\u2019al. 109b)). Le promoteur souhaitant r\u00e9aliser un projet d\u00e9sign\u00e9 qui risque d\u2019entra\u00eener l\u2019un des effets \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au paragraphe 7(1) est susceptible d\u2019avoir \u00e0 le soumettre \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation dite propre au projet (para. 7(1) et (3)). Le forage de puits d\u2019exploration extrac\u00f4tiers est pr\u00e9vu au titre des projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au R\u00e8glement (art. 2 du R\u00e8glement et art. 34 de l\u2019annexe du R\u00e8glement). Le processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019impact des projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s compte trois principales \u00e9tapes, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019\u00e9tape pr\u00e9paratoire, l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019impact et l\u2019\u00e9tape de prise de d\u00e9cision. J\u2019explique bri\u00e8vement chacune.\n(a) L\u2019\u00e9tape pr\u00e9paratoire\n[7] Une fois que le promoteur d\u2019un projet d\u00e9sign\u00e9 a fourni \u00e0 l\u2019Agence d\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019impact du Canada (l\u2019Agence) les renseignements voulus, l\u2019Agence d\u00e9termine si le projet doit faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une \u00e9valuation d\u2019impact (art. 10 \u00e0 16). Si c\u2019est le cas, le processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019impact est lanc\u00e9 (Renvoi, aux para. 38 \u00e0 41).\n(b) L\u2019\u00e9tape d\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019impact\n[8] L\u2019\u00e9valuation est effectu\u00e9e par l\u2019Agence ou par une commission d\u2019examen. L\u2019\u00e9valuation porte sur les effets possibles du projet propos\u00e9 sur l\u2019environnement ou les conditions sanitaires, sociales ou \u00e9conomiques ainsi que sur les avantages escompt\u00e9s (art. 18, 22, 41 et 42). L\u2019Agence ou la commission d\u2019examen, selon le cas, r\u00e9dige un rapport d\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019impact sur le fondement des renseignements fournis (art. 28 et 51; Renvoi, aux para. 42 \u00e0 45).\n(c) L\u2019\u00e9tape de la prise de d\u00e9cision\n[9] Le d\u00e9cideur est soit le ministre de l\u2019Environnement (le ministre), soit le gouverneur en conseil. Le gouverneur en conseil est charg\u00e9 de la prise de d\u00e9cision si l\u2019\u00e9valuation a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e par une commission d\u2019examen ou si le ministre lui renvoie la d\u00e9cision (art. 60 \u00e0 62). Le d\u00e9cideur, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du rapport d\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019impact, d\u00e9cide \u00ab si les effets relevant d\u2019un domaine de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui sont n\u00e9gatifs \u2013 ou les effets directs accessoires n\u00e9gatifs \u2013 identifi\u00e9s dans le rapport sont [\u2026] dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00bb (al. 60(1)a) et b)). Dans l\u2019affirmative, le ministre fixe toute condition qu\u2019il estime indiqu\u00e9e que le promoteur est tenu de respecter relativement \u00e0 ces effets (art. 64; Renvoi, au para. 46).\n(2) M\u00e9canisme d\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale\n[10] Lorsque plusieurs projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s sont r\u00e9alis\u00e9s ou envisag\u00e9s dans une m\u00eame r\u00e9gion, la Loi pr\u00e9voit un m\u00e9canisme d\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale susceptible de se substituer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation propre au projet. \u00c0 l\u2019instar du r\u00e9gime visant les projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s, ce m\u00e9canisme d\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale compte trois \u00e9tapes, \u00e0 savoir la planification, l\u2019\u00e9valuation et la prise de d\u00e9cision.\n(a) \u00c9tape de planification\n[11] Aux termes des articles 92 et 93, le ministre est habilit\u00e9, de son propre chef ou en collaboration avec le gouvernement d\u2019une province, \u00e0 constituer un comit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 demander \u00e0 l\u2019Agence de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale. S\u2019il constitue un comit\u00e9, le ministre en nomme le ou les membres et en fixe le mandat (para. 96(1)).\n(b) \u00c9tape de l\u2019\u00e9valuation\n[12] Une fois les membres du comit\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s, les r\u00e8gles suivantes s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 la tenue d\u2019une \u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale :\n\u2022Le comit\u00e9 prend en compte l\u2019information scientifique et les connaissances autochtones fournies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019\u00e9valuation (para. 97(2));\n\u2022Le comit\u00e9 veille \u00e0 ce que le public ait acc\u00e8s aux renseignements qu\u2019il utilise dans le cadre de l\u2019\u00e9valuation (art. 98);\n\u2022Le comit\u00e9 veille \u00e0 ce que le public ait la possibilit\u00e9 de participer de fa\u00e7on significative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation (art. 99);\n\u2022Au terme de l\u2019\u00e9valuation, le comit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente un rapport au ministre. Le rapport indique de quelle mani\u00e8re le comit\u00e9 a pris en compte et utilis\u00e9 les connaissances autochtones (art. 102).\n(c) \u00c9tape de la prise de d\u00e9cision\n[13] Apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance de l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale, le ministre peut, par voie de r\u00e8glement, exclure une activit\u00e9 concr\u00e8te dans une r\u00e9gion d\u2019une \u00e9valuation propre au projet si les conditions prescrites par r\u00e8glement sont respect\u00e9es : (al. 112(1)a.2), para. 112(2) et art. 112.1 de la Loi).\n[14] Le ministre a opt\u00e9 pour une \u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, qui implique un projet de forage de puits d\u2019exploration extrac\u00f4tiers p\u00e9troliers et gaziers dans une zone d\u00e9finie \u00e0 l\u2019est de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador (zone d\u2019\u00e9tude).\nB. Faits\n[15] Les faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce peuvent se r\u00e9sumer en suivant l\u2019ordre des trois \u00e9tapes de l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale.\n(1) \u00c9tape de pr\u00e9paration\n[16] En mars 2019, le gouvernement du Canada, le gouvernement de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador ainsi que l\u2019Office Canada-Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador des hydrocarbures extrac\u00f4tiers (l\u2019Office) ont conclu l\u2019Entente pour la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019une \u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale concernant des forages exploratoires d\u2019hydrocarbures extrac\u00f4tiers \u00e0 l\u2019est de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador (l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale) (entente, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 123 \u00e0 137).\n[17] L\u2019Entente d\u00e9finit l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale comme \u00e9tant \u00ab une \u00e9tude ou une \u00e9valuation des effets des activit\u00e9s concr\u00e8tes actuelles ou futures exerc\u00e9es dans une r\u00e9gion \u00bb, et prescrit les facteurs que l\u2019\u00e9valuation doit prendre en compte (entente, d\u00e9finition de l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale et annexe A, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 124, 131 et 132).\n[18] L\u2019Entente pr\u00e9voit la constitution d\u2019un comit\u00e9 compos\u00e9 de cinq membres (le Comit\u00e9) charg\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale (entente, d\u00e9finition de comit\u00e9 et clause 3.1, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 125). Elle pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement le mandat du Comit\u00e9, les param\u00e8tres de l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments devant \u00eatre inclus dans le rapport du Comit\u00e9 au ministre apr\u00e8s la tenue de l\u2019\u00e9valuation (entente, clauses 4.14 et 4.15 et annexes A et D, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 126, 131 \u00e0 132 et 135 \u00e0 137).\n[19] Comme il est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019Entente, un \u00ab groupe de travail \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 pour \u00e9pauler le Comit\u00e9. Il \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de techniciens issus de l\u2019Agence, de l\u2019Office et de divers minist\u00e8res (entente, clauses 4.1 \u00e0 4.8, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 125 \u00e0 126; affidavit de Stephen B. Chapman, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 1481, au para. 34). Le Comit\u00e9 pouvait \u00e9galement compter sur l\u2019apport d\u2019un groupe consultatif technique (GCT), constitu\u00e9 notamment des appelants, d\u2019agences et de minist\u00e8res concern\u00e9s, de groupes autochtones ainsi que des organisations du secteur et des regroupements d\u2019intervenants (entente, clauses 4.9 \u00e0 4.13, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 126; affidavit de Stephen B. Chapman, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 1481, au para. 34).\n(2) \u00c9tape d\u2019\u00e9valuation\n[20] Des groupes autochtones ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9s selon un plan de consultation en trois \u00e9tapes (rapport d\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale, rubrique 2.2.4, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 169 \u00e0 172).\n[21] D\u00e8s le printemps de 2019, le Comit\u00e9 a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale, qui s\u2019est conclue par la mise au point d\u2019un syst\u00e8me d\u2019information g\u00e9ographique (SIG) au mois de mai 2020. Cet outil fournit des donn\u00e9es techniques \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale (jugement de la CF, au para. 13).\n[22] Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, le Comit\u00e9 a tenu plusieurs r\u00e9unions, dont (1) une s\u00e9rie de rencontres ayant pour objet la planification et la d\u00e9finition des questions vis\u00e9es (mai 2019); (2) des s\u00e9ances du GCT sur divers th\u00e8mes, comme la mise au point du SIG (mai 2019), les connaissances autochtones (septembre 2019) et des recensions d\u2019\u00e9crits sur les effets environnementaux du forage de puits d\u2019exploration extrac\u00f4tiers (octobre 2019); et (3) des ateliers visant \u00e0 favoriser les discussions et \u00e0 solliciter les avis sur la version pr\u00e9liminaire de ses recommandations avant la publication de son rapport provisoire (d\u00e9cembre 2019).\n[23] Les appelants ont particip\u00e9 activement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale. Le Conseil des Innu de Ekuanitshit (Conseil des Innu), l\u2019un des intervenants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, a particip\u00e9 aux activit\u00e9s int\u00e9ressant les questions d\u2019importance pour les Autochtones (jugement de la CF, aux para. 4 \u00e0 13).\n[24] \u00c0 l\u2019exclusion de certains documents, le Comit\u00e9 a publi\u00e9 dans le registre affich\u00e9 sur le site Internet de l\u2019Agence les renseignements ayant \u00e9tay\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale et les commentaires qu\u2019il a re\u00e7us (affidavit de Stephen B. Chapman, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 1488, aux para. 67 et 68).\n[25] Le 23 janvier 2020, le Comit\u00e9 a rendu public son rapport provisoire et a pr\u00e9vu une p\u00e9riode de trente jours \u00e0 l\u2019intention du public \u2013 et des appelants \u2013 pour les commentaires. Les appelants et le Conseil des Innu ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des commentaires (jugement de la CF, au para. 13; affidavit de Gretchen Fitzgerald, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 875 et 876, au para. 23; affidavit de Sigrid Kuehnemund, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 1082, au para. 32; affidavit de Keith Edward MacMaster, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 1355 \u00e0 1357, au para. 37; r\u00e9ponse au rapport provisoire du Conseil des Innu dat\u00e9e du 21 f\u00e9vrier 2020, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 2437).\n[26] Le Comit\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son rapport final (le rapport) au ministre le 29 f\u00e9vrier 2020 et l\u2019a rendu public le 4 mars 2020 (jugement de la CF, au para. 13).\n(3) L\u2019\u00e9tape de prise de d\u00e9cision\n[27] Le jour de la publication du rapport, l\u2019Agence a publi\u00e9 le Document de travail sur un projet de r\u00e8glement minist\u00e9riel visant \u00e0 d\u00e9signer le forage exploratoire extrac\u00f4tier \u00e0 l\u2019est de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador aux fins d\u2019exclusion en vertu de la Loi sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019impact (le document de travail sur le projet de r\u00e8glement) (affidavit de Stephen B. Chapman, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 1500 \u00e0 1501, au para. 122; document de travail sur le projet de r\u00e8glement, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 1023 \u00e0 1049).\n[28] Le public avait jusqu\u2019au 30 avril 2020 pour pr\u00e9senter des commentaires sur le projet de r\u00e8glement (affidavit de Stephen B. Chapman, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 1501, au para. 125). Les appelants et le Conseil des Innu ont fourni des commentaires (affidavit de Gretchen Fitzgerald, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 892 et 893, aux para. 63 et 64; affidavit de Sigrid Kuehnemund, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 1087 et 1088, au para. 44; affidavit de Keith Edward MacMaster, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 1360 \u00e0 1361, au para. 48; commentaires du Conseil des Innu sur le projet de r\u00e8glement, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 2460).\n[29] Le 3 juin 2020, le ministre a pris le R\u00e8glement visant des activit\u00e9s concr\u00e8tes exclues (puits d\u2019exploration au large des c\u00f4tes Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador) (le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues) pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 112(1)a.2) et de l\u2019article 112.1 de la Loi. Le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues est entr\u00e9 en vigueur le 4 juin 2020. Il a pour effet d\u2019exclure du r\u00e9gime des projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019article 34 de l\u2019annexe du R\u00e8glement les activit\u00e9s concr\u00e8tes pourvu qu\u2019elles remplissent les conditions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019annexe 2 du R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues. Les activit\u00e9s concr\u00e8tes exclues ne sont donc pas assujetties \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation propre au projet.\n[30] Le 4 juin 2020, l\u2019Agence a publi\u00e9 deux documents. Il s\u2019agissait tout d\u2019abord du R\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tude d\u2019impact de la r\u00e9glementation (R\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tude), qui \u00e9nonce les r\u00e9percussions du R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues (R\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tude, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 834 \u00e0 865). Ensuite, l\u2019Agence a publi\u00e9 la r\u00e9ponse minist\u00e9rielle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale, intitul\u00e9e R\u00e9ponse minist\u00e9rielle au rapport du Comit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale pour les projets de forage exploratoire extrac\u00f4tiers \u00e0 l\u2019est de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador (r\u00e9ponse minist\u00e9rielle). Le ministre y affirme que l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale \u00ab a permis au gouvernement du Canada de recueillir des renseignements permettant d\u2019exclure, de mani\u00e8re cr\u00e9dible et bien fond\u00e9e, les puits d\u2019exploration extrac\u00f4ti\u00e8re (dans la zone d\u2019\u00e9tude d\u00e9finie par l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale) de l\u2019\u00e9valuation [projet propre] \u00bb. Le ministre ajoute que \u00ab [c]ela ne peut se produire que lorsqu\u2019un projet est conforme aux conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le [R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues] \u00bb. Il a essentiellement accept\u00e9 les 41 recommandations du Comit\u00e9. Il a aussi accept\u00e9 en grande partie les recommandations du Comit\u00e9 visant \u00e0 prescrire dans le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues certaines mesures auxquelles serait subordonn\u00e9 tout projet futur de forage exploratoire dans la zone d\u2019\u00e9tude. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a incorpor\u00e9 ces mesures dans le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues, sous r\u00e9serve de certaines exceptions et ajouts, qu\u2019il explique dans la r\u00e9ponse minist\u00e9rielle (r\u00e9ponse minist\u00e9rielle, dossier d\u2019appel, p. 348 \u00e0 370).\nC. Historique judiciaire\n(1) Appel interjet\u00e9 avant le prononc\u00e9 du Renvoi\n[31] Les appelants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire aupr\u00e8s de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour contester, d\u2019une part, la validit\u00e9 du rapport et, d\u2019autre part, la validit\u00e9 du R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 les deux demandes. Dans un premier temps, elle a conclu que le rapport \u00e9chappait au contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps, elle a jug\u00e9 raisonnable le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues, car (1) il cadre avec l\u2019objet de la Loi, (2) il tombe sous le coup du pouvoir pr\u00e9vu dans la Loi en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9glementation et (3) il respecte les conditions prescrites au paragraphe 112(2), \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris apr\u00e8s l\u2019examen par le ministre d\u2019une \u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale qui ne comportait pas de lacunes importantes.\n[32] Les appelants interjettent appel du jugement de la CF. Selon eux, l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale et le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues sont issus d\u2019une d\u00e9marche r\u00e9troactive, car la d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 l\u2019action r\u00e9glementaire a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la tenue de l\u2019\u00e9valuation. En proc\u00e9dant ainsi \u00e0 rebours, le Comit\u00e9 a effectu\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation d\u00e9raisonnable et n\u2019a pas assur\u00e9 aux appelants l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. En outre, le ministre n\u2019a pas combl\u00e9 ces lacunes quand il a pris le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues au terme d\u2019une fili\u00e8re elle-m\u00eame lacunaire sur le plan proc\u00e9dural.\n[33] La Cour a entendu l\u2019appel le 21 mars 2023.\n(2) Le Renvoi\n[34] Dans le cadre du Renvoi, la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e9tait appel\u00e9e \u00e0 se prononcer sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la Loi et du R\u00e8glement. Elle a conclu que la Loi dans son ensemble, \u00e0 l\u2019exception des articles 81 \u00e0 91, est ultra vires du Parlement et est donc invalide. Partant, le R\u00e8glement \u00e9tait \u00e9galement invalide. Sa conclusion est le fruit d\u2019une analyse fond\u00e9e sur le partage des pouvoirs, qui s\u2019effectue en deux \u00e9tapes, \u00e0 savoir la qualification et la classification.\n[35] En premier lieu, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la qualification, la Cour supr\u00eame examine l\u2019objet et les effets de la Loi pour en d\u00e9terminer le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable. Elle arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que la Loi comporte deux composantes distinctes (Renvoi, au para. 109). La premi\u00e8re concerne les \u00ab projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00bb et a pour objet d\u2019\u00e9valuer et de r\u00e9glementer les projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s afin d\u2019att\u00e9nuer ou de pr\u00e9venir les r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives \u00e0 l\u2019environnement ou aux conditions sanitaires, sociales ou \u00e9conomiques. La seconde, qui est pr\u00e9vue aux articles 81 \u00e0 91, prescrit la fa\u00e7on dont les autorit\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9rales qui r\u00e9alisent ou financent un projet sur un territoire domanial (f\u00e9d\u00e9ral) ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger \u00e9valuent les effets environnements n\u00e9gatifs importants.\n[36] En second lieu, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la classification, la Cour supr\u00eame est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 quel chef de comp\u00e9tence se rattache le caract\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable de la Loi. Elle confirme la validit\u00e9 de la seconde composante de la Loi (les articles 81 \u00e0 91) pour trois motifs : (1) sa constitutionnalit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9e; (2) elle s\u2019apparente au r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gal que la Cour supr\u00eame a confirm\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Friends of the Oldman River Society c. Canada (Ministre des Transports), [1992] 1 R.C.S. 3 [Oldman River] et (3) il est possible de la dissocier du reste de la Loi (Renvoi, aux para. 207 \u00e0 211). En revanche, le r\u00e9gime des projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s, qui est constitu\u00e9 des autres dispositions de la Loi, est inconstitutionnel. Le r\u00e9gime des projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s ne rel\u00e8ve pas d\u2019un chef de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et ce pour deux raisons (Renvoi, aux para. 131 \u00e0 139). Primo, le m\u00e9canisme de prise de d\u00e9cision du r\u00e9gime n\u2019est pas ax\u00e9 sur les effets relevant v\u00e9ritablement d\u2019une comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Renvoi, aux para. 141 \u00e0 178). Autrement dit, il est loisible au d\u00e9cideur de tenir compte \u00e9galement d\u2019effets n\u00e9gatifs ne relevant pas d\u2019un domaine de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Secundo, les d\u00e9cisions sont prises \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de consid\u00e9rations que l\u2019on d\u00e9finit comme \u00ab effets relevant d\u2019un domaine de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb. Or, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019utilisation du terme \u00ab effets relevant d\u2019un domaine de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb, les consid\u00e9rations vont bien au-del\u00e0 des limites de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Renvoi, aux para. 179 \u00e0 203). Pour ces motifs, la Cour supr\u00eame estime que la Loi, \u00e0 l\u2019exception des articles 81 \u00e0 91, et le R\u00e8glement, outrepassent les limites de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n(3) Th\u00e8ses des parties apr\u00e8s le Renvoi\n[37] Apr\u00e8s la publication du Renvoi, la Cour a demand\u00e9 aux parties, par voie de directive, de pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e9crites sur les r\u00e9percussions de cette d\u00e9cision sur le pr\u00e9sent appel, s\u2019il en est.\n(a) Th\u00e8se des appelants et du Conseil des Innu\n[38] Les appelants et le Conseil des Innu affirment que le Renvoi n\u2019a pas d\u2019incidence sur les questions en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Selon eux, le Renvoi porte sur d\u2019autres dispositions de la Loi que la pr\u00e9sente instance et int\u00e9resse des domaines de comp\u00e9tence partag\u00e9e. En revanche, l\u2019appel dont la Cour est saisie concerne un \u00ab territoire domanial \u00bb qui rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Subsidiairement, les appelants soutiennent que, si la Cour conclut que le Renvoi a invalid\u00e9 les dispositions r\u00e9gissant les \u00e9valuations r\u00e9gionales (art. 92 \u00e0 103 et 112 \u00e0 112.1), le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues est d\u00e9pourvu de disposition habilitante et doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9. Selon eux, m\u00eame si l\u2019annulation de ce texte r\u00e9glementaire rend l\u2019instance th\u00e9orique, la Cour devrait n\u00e9anmoins user de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et se prononcer sur les questions de droit administratif que soul\u00e8ve l\u2019appel.\n[39] Les appelants ont par ailleurs d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis de question constitutionnelle conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 57 de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. (1985), ch. F\u20117. Ils soul\u00e8vent l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 du R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario (l\u2019Ontario) et le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador (Terre-Neuve), \u00e0 titre d\u2019intervenants, ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis de question constitutionnelle.\n(b) Th\u00e8se des intim\u00e9s et du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario\n[40] De l\u2019avis des intim\u00e9s, on peut d\u00e9duire du Renvoi que l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale n\u2019est pas susceptible de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, la seule question \u00e0 trancher est celle de savoir si le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues est valide. Or, comme la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu \u00e0 l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 du r\u00e9gime des projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s pr\u00e9vu dans la Loi, le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues ne saurait avoir pour objet d\u2019exclure des activit\u00e9s du r\u00e9gime des projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s. Partant, point n\u2019est besoin de se prononcer sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 du R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues, et la question de sa validit\u00e9 est dor\u00e9navant th\u00e9orique.\n[41] La th\u00e8se de l\u2019Ontario va plus loin; selon elle, la Cour est tenue de d\u00e9clarer invalides les dispositions en litige de la Loi, le R\u00e8glement et le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues. Elle doit d\u00e9clarer invalide le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues, car il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 112(1)a.2) et de l\u2019article 112.1, qui font partie du r\u00e9gime jug\u00e9 inconstitutionnel dans le Renvoi. Selon l\u2019Ontario, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la Cour supr\u00eame n\u2019a pas ordonn\u00e9 la suspension de sa d\u00e9claration d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la Loi et du R\u00e8glement, notre Cour doit prononcer une d\u00e9claration d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 ayant effet sur-le-champ.\n(c) Th\u00e8se de Terre-Neuve\n[42] Terre-Neuve est d\u2019avis que le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues rel\u00e8ve d\u2019un domaine de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Premi\u00e8rement, ce r\u00e8glement s\u2019applique au plateau continental, une zone de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale exclusive (Renvoi relatif au plateau continental de Terre-Neuve, [1984] 1 R.C.S. 86, p. 97. Deuxi\u00e8mement, ce r\u00e8glement est le fruit d\u2019une collaboration entre les gouvernements de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador et du Canada ainsi que de leurs agences respectives. Autrement dit, le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues est issu du f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme coop\u00e9ratif, un principe dont l\u2019importance est reconnue par la Cour supr\u00eame dans le Renvoi. Il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019application de l\u2019analyse et du raisonnement \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans le Renvoi \u00e0 la matrice factuelle de la pr\u00e9sente instance m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la conclusion que le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues est constitutionnel. Subsidiairement, Terre-Neuve soutient que la pr\u00e9sente affaire justifie le prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une d\u00e9claration d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 suspendue.\nIII. Questions\n[43] Les appelants soul\u00e8vent les questions suivantes :\nL\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale est-elle susceptible de contr\u00f4le judiciaire?\nL\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale \u00e9tait-elle d\u00e9raisonnable?\nDans le cadre de l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale, a-t-on manqu\u00e9 au devoir d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale?\nLa d\u00e9cision du ministre de prendre le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues \u00e9tait-elle d\u00e9raisonnable?\nIV. Analyse\nA. L\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale est-elle susceptible de contr\u00f4le judiciaire?\n[44] L\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale a donn\u00e9 lieu au rapport que les appelants contestent. Selon la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le rapport n\u2019est pas susceptible de contr\u00f4le judiciaire (jugement de la CF, au para. 32). Devant notre Cour, les parties conviennent que la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte s\u2019applique \u00e0 la question de savoir si le rapport \u00e9chappe bel et bien au contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Pour les motifs qui suivent, je suis d\u2019avis que tant l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale que le rapport y \u00e9chappent.\n[45] Comme je le mentionne plus haut, le m\u00e9canisme d\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale compte essentiellement trois \u00e9tapes, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019\u00e9tape pr\u00e9paratoire, l\u2019\u00e9tape d\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale et l\u2019\u00e9tape de la prise de d\u00e9cision.\n[46] Le terme \u00ab \u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale \u00bb n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fini dans la Loi. Il l\u2019est toutefois dans l\u2019Entente, qui le d\u00e9finit comme une \u00ab \u00e9tude \u00bb ou une \u00ab \u00e9valuation \u00bb des effets des activit\u00e9s concr\u00e8tes actuelles ou futures exerc\u00e9es dans une r\u00e9gion. Il ressort clairement de cette d\u00e9finition que l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale et le rapport qui en d\u00e9coule ne sont pas des d\u00e9cisions, car ils n\u2019ont pas pour effet \u00ab de porter atteinte \u00e0 des droits, d\u2019imposer des obligations juridiques ni d\u2019entra\u00eener des effets pr\u00e9judiciables \u00bb (Sganos c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CAF 84, au para. 6).\n[47] En fait, il y a atteinte \u00e0 des droits ou imposition d\u2019obligations lorsque le ministre d\u00e9cide s\u2019il y a lieu de prendre un r\u00e8glement qui exempte des projets potentiels d\u2019une \u00e9valuation propre \u00e0 chaque projet. La Loi exige que le ministre tienne compte de l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale avant de prendre un tel r\u00e8glement, mais la d\u00e9cision de donner suite \u00e0 cette \u00e9valuation revient au ministre, et non au comit\u00e9 (para. 112(2)).\n[48] Le m\u00e9canisme d\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale \u00e0 trois \u00e9tapes est calqu\u00e9 sur le r\u00e9gime des projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s, d\u00e9crit plus haut. Le r\u00e9gime des projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comprend une \u00e9tape d\u2019\u00e9valuation, au cours de laquelle l\u2019Agence ou une commission d\u2019examen recueille des renseignements en vue de r\u00e9diger un rapport. Il comprend \u00e9galement une \u00e9tape de prise de d\u00e9cision, dans le cadre de laquelle le ministre ou le gouverneur en conseil examine le rapport et d\u00e9termine si les effets du projet sont dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, auquel cas, le ministre impose des conditions \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation du projet d\u00e9sign\u00e9. La Cour supr\u00eame consid\u00e8re que le r\u00e9gime visant les projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00ab instaure un processus de collecte de renseignements au service d\u2019une fonction de prise de d\u00e9cisions \u00bb (Renvoi, au para. 81). De plus, elle souligne que l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019\u00e9valuation est clairement distincte de l\u2019\u00e9tape de la prise de d\u00e9cision et que les deux \u00e9tapes soul\u00e8vent des questions constitutionnelles diff\u00e9rentes (Renvoi, aux para. 155 \u00e0 161).\n[49] Appliquant l\u2019analyse \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame au m\u00e9canisme d\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale, je conclus que l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale (l\u2019\u00e9tape d\u2019\u00e9valuation), bien qu\u2019elle fasse \u00ab partie int\u00e9grante d\u2019un processus \u00e9clair\u00e9 de prise de d\u00e9cisions \u00bb (Oldman River, p. 71), ne n\u00e9cessite aucune prise de d\u00e9cision et n\u2019entra\u00eene aucune cons\u00e9quence juridique.\n[50] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime \u00e0 l\u2019instar de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale que la pr\u00e9sente affaire n\u2019est pas diff\u00e9rente de celles analys\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment par notre Cour et appelle la m\u00eame conclusion, \u00e0 savoir que l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale et le rapport ne sont pas susceptibles de contr\u00f4le judiciaire (jugement de la CF, aux para. 29 et 30; Nation Gitxaala c. Canada, 2016 CAF 187, au para. 125 [Gitxaala]; Tsleil-Waututh Nation c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CAF 153, au para. 202 [Trans Mountain]; Taseko Mines Ltd. c. Canada (Environnement), 2019 CAF 319, au para. 43 [Taseko no 1]; Premi\u00e8re Nation crie Mikisew c. Agence canadienne d\u2019\u00e9valuation environnementale, 2023 CAF 191, au para. 107 [Mikisew].\n[51] Devant notre Cour, les appelants invoquent trois arguments pour justifier une conclusion contraire.\n(1) L\u2019argument fond\u00e9 sur le droit de participer de fa\u00e7on significative\n[52] Les appelants font valoir que le droit du public de participer de fa\u00e7on significative \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale (al. 6(1)h) et art. 99) impose au Comit\u00e9 une obligation juridique correspondante. Si le public est priv\u00e9 de son droit de participer de fa\u00e7on significative et que l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale n\u2019est pas susceptible de contr\u00f4le, la personne ou l\u2019entit\u00e9 l\u00e9s\u00e9e est alors priv\u00e9e de tout recours, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 la Loi (m\u00e9moire des faits et du droit des appelants, au para. 110).\n[53] Je ne suis pas de cet avis.\n[54] Il ressort du dossier que les appelants ont particip\u00e9 au processus et ont eu de nombreuses occasions de formuler des observations lors de s\u00e9ances en personne et par \u00e9crit. Soit, les appelants sont d\u00e9\u00e7us de l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale, mais ils n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9s du droit de participer de fa\u00e7on significative.\n(2) L\u2019argument fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019objet de la Loi\n[55] Selon les appelants, obliger les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 attendre le prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une d\u00e9cision avant de contester les lacunes de l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale minerait l\u2019un des objets de la Loi, \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)(b.1), qui consiste \u00e0 mettre en place un processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019impact \u00e9quitable, pr\u00e9visible et efficace (m\u00e9moire des faits et du droit des appelants, au para. 115).\n[56] L\u00e0 encore, je ne suis pas de cet avis.\n[57] Permettre aux int\u00e9ress\u00e9s de contester une \u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale qui ne m\u00e8nera peut\u2011\u00eatre \u00e0 aucune d\u00e9cision constituerait un gaspillage de ressources judiciaires et serait donc inefficace. De plus, je ne vois pas en quoi contester une \u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale \u2013 une \u00e9tude qui ne donnera pas forc\u00e9ment lieu \u00e0 des mesures \u2013 rendrait le processus \u00e9quitable ou pr\u00e9visible.\n(3) L\u2019argument fond\u00e9 sur les changements l\u00e9gislatifs\n[58] Enfin, les appelants pr\u00e9sentent un argument fond\u00e9 sur les changements l\u00e9gislatifs. De ce que je comprends, ils font valoir que le rapport \u00e9tabli sous le r\u00e9gime pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la Loi canadienne sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation environnementale (2012), L.C. 2012, ch. 19, art. 52 (la LCEE), \u00e9tait \u00ab d\u00e9finitif et sans appel \u00bb et \u00e9chappait au contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Il est donc diff\u00e9rent de celui \u00e9tabli sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi; ce dernier n\u2019\u00e9tant pas \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Selon les appelants, comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tenu compte de ces diff\u00e9rences, elle a tranch\u00e9 \u00e0 mauvais droit sur le fondement des arr\u00eats Gitxaala, Trans Mountain et Taseko no 1, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCEE (m\u00e9moire des faits et du droit des appelants, aux para. 115 \u00e0 119).\n[59] Je ne peux partager cet avis. Puisqu\u2019un rapport \u00e9tabli sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCEE \u2013 lequel selon les appelants s\u2019assimile \u00e0 une \u00ab d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive et sans appel \u00bb \u2013 \u00e9chappe au contr\u00f4le judiciaire, raison de plus pour qu\u2019un rapport \u00e9tabli sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi, \u2013 lequel s\u2019apparente encore moins \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision \u00ab d\u00e9finitive et sans appel \u00bb \u2013 y \u00e9chappe lui aussi.\n(4) Conclusion sur l\u2019assujettissement au contr\u00f4le judiciaire\n[60] Le rapport \u00e9chappe au contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Il en va de m\u00eame pour l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale, un document provisoire qui a men\u00e9 simplement au rapport. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendu une d\u00e9cision correcte en rejetant la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire du rapport pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les appelants.\n[61] Cela dit, ce n\u2019est pas parce qu\u2019une \u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale, prise isol\u00e9ment, n\u2019est pas susceptible de contr\u00f4le qu\u2019elle est toujours \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Si l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale comporte des lacunes importantes (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire qu\u2019elle est d\u00e9raisonnable ou ne respecte pas l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale), le r\u00e8glement qui en d\u00e9coule peut \u00eatre annul\u00e9 au motif que le ministre n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 la condition l\u00e9gale \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au paragraphe 112(2) pour prendre ce r\u00e8glement (jugement de la CF, aux para. 26, 31, renvoyant \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Trans Mountain, au para. 201; Mikisew, au para. 108 et 109).\n[62] L\u2019affaire soul\u00e8ve trois autres questions en litige. L\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale \u00e9tait-elle raisonnable? L\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale respectait-elle l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale? La d\u00e9cision du ministre de prendre le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues \u00e9tait-elle raisonnable? Toutefois, trancher ces questions ne servirait \u00e0 rien si le Renvoi suppose que le ministre n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de prendre ce r\u00e8glement. Par cons\u00e9quent, je dois d\u00e9terminer si le Renvoi rend ces questions th\u00e9oriques.\nB. Le Renvoi a-t-il rendu les autres questions en litige th\u00e9oriques?\n(1) La doctrine du caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique\n[63] Selon la doctrine du caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique, le tribunal peut refuser d\u2019instruire une affaire lorsque sa d\u00e9cision n\u2019aura aucun effet pratique sur les droits des parties. Il peut tout de m\u00eame choisir d\u2019instruire une affaire th\u00e9orique s\u2019il estime que les circonstances le justifient (Borowski c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1989] 1 R.C.S. 342, p. 353 [Borowski]). Ainsi, l\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique se fait en deux temps.\n[64] Dans un premier temps, le tribunal d\u00e9termine si l\u2019affaire est th\u00e9orique, ce qui est le cas lorsqu\u2019elle ne pr\u00e9sente aucun litige actuel ayant des cons\u00e9quences sur les droits des parties (Borowski, p. 353 \u00e0 356; Peckford c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2023 CAF 219, au para. 9 [Peckford]).\n[65] Dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps, le tribunal d\u00e9termine s\u2019il convient d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour instruire l\u2019affaire malgr\u00e9 son caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Borowski, la Cour supr\u00eame formule trois facteurs pour guider le tribunal dans l\u2019exercice de ce pouvoir :\nla pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un d\u00e9bat contradictoire;\nl\u2019\u00e9conomie des ressources judiciaires; et\nla n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour le tribunal de se montrer sensible \u00e0 sa fonction juridictionnelle dans notre structure politique.\n(Borowski, p. 358 \u00e0 363; Peckford, au para. 10)\n(2) Application de la doctrine du caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique au pr\u00e9sent appel\n[66] Comme je le mentionne plus haut, les appelants soul\u00e8vent trois autres questions en litige. L\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale \u00e9tait-elle raisonnable? L\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale respectait-elle l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale? La d\u00e9cision du ministre de prendre le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues \u00e9tait-elle raisonnable? \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des observations utiles des parties et des intervenants en ce qui concerne le Renvoi, je conclus que ces questions sont th\u00e9oriques, car la Cour supr\u00eame a statu\u00e9 que, outre quelques dispositions qui ne s\u2019appliquent pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Loi est ultra vires du Parlement.\n[67] En principe, la r\u00e9ponse de la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e0 la question qui lui est pos\u00e9e par renvoi est de nature consultative et non contraignante; en pratique, les tribunaux la suivent et la traitent comme une d\u00e9cision judiciaire (Renvoi relatif au Code de proc\u00e9dure civile (Qc), art. 35, 2021 CSC 27, aux para. 151 et 152; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Bedford, 2013 CSC 72, au para. 40; Reference Re Certification in the Manitoba Health Sector, 2019 MBCA 18). Selon cette jurisprudence, je dois suivre l\u2019avis de la Cour supr\u00eame selon lequel la Loi dans son ensemble est inconstitutionnelle, sauf les articles 81 \u00e0 91. Bien que, dans le Renvoi, la Cour supr\u00eame n\u2019examine pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le r\u00e9gime d\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la Loi, celui\u2011ci demeure invalide parce qu\u2019il est impossible de le dissocier du r\u00e9gime visant les projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s (Renvoi, au para. 210).\n[68] De plus, selon la Cour supr\u00eame, le tribunal doit refuser de donner effet \u00e0 une loi inconstitutionnelle (Ontario (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. G, 2020 CSC 38, au para. 88).\n[69] Puisqu\u2019un r\u00e8glement valide ne peut reposer sur une loi invalide, il va de soi que le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues, \u00e0 l\u2019instar du R\u00e8glement, est invalide (Elmer A. Driedger, \u00ab Subordinate Legislation \u00bb (1960), 38 Can Bar Rev 1, p. 7). Pour les fins du pr\u00e9sent appel, comme la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que la Loi (hormis les articles 81 \u00e0 91) est inconstitutionnelle, le ministre n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de prendre le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues (Tranchemontagne c. Ontario (Directeur du Programme ontarien de soutien aux personnes handicap\u00e9es, 2006 CSC 14, au para. 16; Brown c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2020 CAF 130, au para. 40; Entertainment Software Association c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des auteurs, compositeurs et \u00e9diteurs de musique, 2020 CAF 100, au para. 88; Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration) c. Singh, 2016 CAF 300, au para. 16).\n[70] De plus, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 112(1)a.2) de la Loi conf\u00e8re au ministre le pouvoir d\u2019exclure par r\u00e8glement les activit\u00e9s concr\u00e8tes qui ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une \u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale de celles \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 titre de \u00ab projets d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00bb dans le R\u00e8glement. Puisque la Cour supr\u00eame conclut que le R\u00e8glement est inconstitutionnel, il n\u2019y a plus d\u2019activit\u00e9s concr\u00e8tes \u00e0 exclure, et ce m\u00eame si le cadre factuel concerne un domaine de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale exclusive. Par cons\u00e9quent, suivant le premier volet de l\u2019analyse \u00e9tablie dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Borowski, je conclus que les autres questions en litige sont th\u00e9oriques.\n[71] Suivant le second volet de cette analyse, je dois d\u00e9terminer si notre Cour devrait exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire l\u2019habilitant \u00e0 examiner les autres questions en litige malgr\u00e9 leur caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique. Les appelants et les intim\u00e9s s\u2019entendent pour dire qu\u2019il existe toujours un litige les opposant. Bien qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse l\u00e0 d\u2019une bonne raison d\u2019examiner les trois autres questions, les deux facteurs suivants militent fortement contre un tel examen.\n(a) \u00c9conomie des ressources judiciaires\n[72] Le pr\u00e9sent appel ne constitue pas la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du litige entre les appelants, le Comit\u00e9 et le ministre. Le litige a d\u00e9but\u00e9 il y a environ cinq ans, lorsque l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale \u00e9tait en cours. Il ressort du contexte factuel, de la preuve et des observations des parties que celles\u2011ci ont investi \u00e9norm\u00e9ment d\u2019efforts et de ressources dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale et le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues.\n[73] Je ne saurais trop insister sur l\u2019ampleur du travail accompli par les parties et les intervenants dans le cadre de l\u2019appel et de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire qui l\u2019a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9. Les frais relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019instance ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9s, et la Cour n\u2019a plus qu\u2019\u00e0 statuer sur les trois autres questions en litige. Dans ce contexte, les appelants font valoir que, si notre Cour refuse de se prononcer sur ces trois autres questions, ils devront pr\u00e9senter une troisi\u00e8me demande \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le cas o\u00f9 le ministre s\u2019appuie sur le rapport pour prendre un nouveau R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues.\n[74] Or, m\u00eame si notre Cour statue sur les trois autres questions en litige, rien ne garantit qu\u2019il n\u2019y aura pas une troisi\u00e8me demande ou une autre contestation judiciaire. L\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale, qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction du rapport, pr\u00e9sentait un int\u00e9r\u00eat en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, car le paragraphe 112(2) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le ministre doit tenir compte d\u2019une telle \u00e9valuation avant de prendre un r\u00e8glement. Il fallait donc s\u2019assurer que le rapport ne comportait pas de lacunes importantes, ce qui a donn\u00e9 lieu aux deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me questions soulev\u00e9es par les appelants. Toutefois, on ne sait pas si le l\u00e9gislateur maintiendra, dans une version modifi\u00e9e de la Loi, l\u2019obligation pour le ministre de tenir compte d\u2019une \u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale avant de prendre un r\u00e8glement. Peut\u2011\u00eatre que le ministre devra \u00e9galement prendre d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments en consid\u00e9ration. Vu l\u2019incertitude de la situation, \u00e0 quoi bon statuer sur les trois autres questions en litige? En quoi trancher la question de savoir si l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale est raisonnable ou si elle respecte l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale permettrait d\u2019\u00e9viter la multiplication des litiges si la Loi n\u2019exige plus la prise en compte d\u2019une telle \u00e9valuation, \u00e0 elle seule ou au nombre d\u2019autres conditions?\n[75] La question de l\u2019utilit\u00e9 d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur les autres questions en litige se pose m\u00eame si le l\u00e9gislateur, dans une version modifi\u00e9e de la Loi, maintient l\u2019obligation pour le ministre de tenir compte d\u2019une \u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale avant de prendre un r\u00e8glement. En effet, rien ne garantit que le ministre tiendra compte de l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale en cause qu\u2019il a examin\u00e9e avant de prendre le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues. Et m\u00eame s\u2019il le faisait, une d\u00e9cision par laquelle notre Cour conclurait que l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale est raisonnable et respecte l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale pourrait n\u2019\u00eatre d\u2019aucune utilit\u00e9 pour les appelants. Par exemple, le passage du temps ou l\u2019\u00e9volution du contexte pourraient donner lieu \u00e0 d\u2019autres arguments qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et qui appuieraient la conclusion que l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale est d\u00e9raisonnable ou ne respecte pas l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, ce qui justifierait une nouvelle contestation judiciaire. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, une d\u00e9cision par laquelle notre Cour conclurait que l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas raisonnable ou ne respectait pas l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale pourrait n\u2019\u00eatre d\u2019aucune utilit\u00e9 pour les appelants si le ministre envisage une version am\u00e9lior\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale avant de prendre des r\u00e8glements \u00e0 l\u2019avenir.\n[76] Par cons\u00e9quent, rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur les trois autres questions en litige fera obstacle \u00e0 de futurs litiges. En outre, une telle d\u00e9cision n\u2019aurait aucun effet pratique sur les droits des parties et ne servirait \u00e0 rien. Je ne vois aucune utilit\u00e9 \u00e0 me prononcer sur le caract\u00e8re raisonnable ou non de la d\u00e9cision du ministre de prendre le R\u00e8glement sur les activit\u00e9s exclues. De m\u00eame, une d\u00e9cision sur la question de savoir si l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale \u00e9tait raisonnable et respectait l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale n\u2019aurait qu\u2019une valeur limit\u00e9e, car elle serait rendue dans un contexte pr\u00e9cis qui a peu de chances de se reproduire (Peckford, au para. 31).\n(b) R\u00f4le de notre Cour\n[77] Compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame dans le Renvoi, mieux vaut laisser au l\u00e9gislateur le soin de d\u00e9cider de la suite des choses.\nV. Conclusion\n[78] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je rejetterais l\u2019appel.

Elle demande \u00e9galement une injonction interlocutoire interdisant certaines d\u00e9clarations publiques en ce qui concerne les questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[2] Le pr\u00e9sent appel est l\u2019un des deux appels qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interjet\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (2024 CF 413, le juge Paul Favel) qui a tranch\u00e9 deux demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[3] L\u2019une de ces demandes a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la SRFN (dossier no T-2191-22 de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une d\u00e9cision, dat\u00e9e du 18 octobre 2022, dans laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Cecilia (Toni) Josephine Heron, qui agissait en sa qualit\u00e9 de cheffe de la SRFN, a convoqu\u00e9 une assembl\u00e9e extraordinaire afin de d\u00e9mettre de leurs fonctions deux conseillers de la SRFN. Au terme de cette assembl\u00e9e extraordinaire, qui a eu lieu le 23 octobre 2022, les deux conseillers en question ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9mis de leurs fonctions. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 la demande de la SRFN et celle-ci a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le pr\u00e9sent appel (dossier no A-109-24 de notre Cour) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[4] L\u2019autre demande (dossier no T-2206-22 de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale) tranch\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale visait \u00e0 obtenir que deux demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par Mme Heron soient examin\u00e9es ensemble (l\u2019autre demande \u00e9tant le dossier no T-97-23 de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale). Dans ces demandes, Mme Heron contestait une s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions dans lesquelles la SRFN la suspendait \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition en sa qualit\u00e9 de cheffe, (\u00e0 partir du 13 octobre 2022 jusqu\u2019au 12 d\u00e9cembre 2022 et m\u00eame apr\u00e8s cette date), et ce, sans solde.

Cet aspect de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale fait l\u2019objet du dossier no A-107-24 de notre Cour.\n[5] Les parties ont convenu que (i) l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(1)b) de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C.

La SRFN fait valoir que [TRADUCTION] \u00ab les membres du personnel \u00e9taient incapables de faire leur travail ou avaient abandonn\u00e9 leur travail en raison des tensions et de l\u2019incertitude sur le plan politique, et que la m\u00eame chose est en train de se produire \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 la SRFN \u00bb. Elle avance \u00e9galement qu\u2019il lui a fallu des ann\u00e9es pour refaire sa r\u00e9putation.\n[15] Tout d\u2019abord, ayant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tablissant le pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable doivent \u00eatre clairs, convaincants et non conjecturaux, je ne suis pas convaincu que de quelconques \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve admissibles (c.-\u00e0-d. autres que du ou\u00ef-dire) et convaincants \u00e9tayent l\u2019argument selon lequel les effets pr\u00e9judiciables de bouleversements politiques se produisent \u00e0 nouveau au sein de la SRFN. Bien que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments menant \u00e0 de tels effets soient peut-\u00eatre en place et que de tels effets soient susceptibles de se produire, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un argument conjectural qui n\u2019est pas convaincant. Je fais \u00e9galement remarquer que la SRFN elle-m\u00eame reconna\u00eet qu\u2019elle a pu refaire sa r\u00e9putation avec le temps. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas clair, selon moi, que de quelconques dommages de la nature de ceux que la SRFN invoque soient irr\u00e9parables.\n[16] En outre, je ne suis pas convaincu que le sursis ou l\u2019injonction interlocutoire que la SRFN demande auraient pour effet d\u2019\u00e9viter les dommages \u00e0 sa r\u00e9putation que la SRFN invoque. \u00c0 mon avis, les bouleversements politiques susceptibles de ternir la r\u00e9putation de la SRFN subsisteraient m\u00eame si la requ\u00eate \u00e9tait accueillie.\n[17] Pour ce qui est de l\u2019argument de la SRFN selon lequel le financement dont elle a absolument besoin serait menac\u00e9 dans le cas o\u00f9 la requ\u00eate n\u2019\u00e9tait pas accueillie, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il est conjectural et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, il est insuffisant. La SRFN fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux perturbations et \u00e0 l\u2019instabilit\u00e9 qui pourraient diminuer ses chances d\u2019obtenir un financement important lui permettant de poursuivre un projet d\u2019habitation. Elle soutient \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle subira un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable si les n\u00e9gociations sont interrompues ou retard\u00e9es. Compte tenu de telles \u00e9ventualit\u00e9s, je ne suis pas convaincu, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la SRFN subira un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable.\n[18] En ce qui concerne le troisi\u00e8me argument que la SRFN avance pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019elle subira un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable, soit celui qui se rapporte \u00e0 ses membres, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un argument distinct. En effet, cet argument fait plut\u00f4t allusion aux effets irr\u00e9parables des pr\u00e9judices que subiraient les membres de la SRFN si le statu quo qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9dait la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9tabli. Or, je ne suis pas convaincu que l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des pr\u00e9judices all\u00e9gu\u00e9s se mat\u00e9rialisera en cas de rejet de la requ\u00eate de la SRFN. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, je ne suis pas convaincu que cela causera un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable \u00e0 ses membres.\n[19] Concernant l\u2019argument selon lequel Mme Heron manque de ressources financi\u00e8res, je fais remarquer que la preuve mentionn\u00e9e par la SRFN n\u2019est qu\u2019une d\u00e9claration non \u00e9tay\u00e9e selon laquelle, si le salaire que Mme Heron demande lui \u00e9tait vers\u00e9 et que l\u2019appel concernant ses suspensions \u00e9tait accueilli, la SRFN ne pourrait jamais recouvrer la somme en question. Or, aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019\u00e9tablit la situation financi\u00e8re de Mme Heron ou sa capacit\u00e9 de rembourser toute somme qui lui serait vers\u00e9e. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, c\u2019est \u00e0 la SRFN qu\u2019il incombe de produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve clairs, convaincants et non conjecturaux pour \u00e9tayer les arguments qu\u2019elle fait valoir. La SRFN ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e de ce fardeau en ce qui concerne ses arguments quant au manque de ressources de Mme Heron.\n[20] La SRFN a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations dans lesquelles elle dit se soucier de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des membres de son personnel administratif. Cependant, la preuve mentionn\u00e9e par la SRFN \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est exclusivement du ou\u00ef-dire et elle ne semble pas \u00eatre vis\u00e9e par l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des exceptions quant \u00e0 l\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve par ou\u00ef-dire. Je n\u2019accorde donc aucun poids \u00e0 cette preuve.\n[21] Il s\u2019ensuit que, pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je ne suis pas convaincu que la SRFN subira un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable si elle n\u2019obtient pas le sursis et l\u2019injonction interlocutoire qu\u2019elle sollicite et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il convient de rejeter la requ\u00eate. Les d\u00e9pens relatifs \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate suivront l\u2019issue de la cause.\n\u00ab George R.

Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2023 CF 103), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u2019une d\u00e9cision rendue par la Commission de la capitale nationale (la CCN ou la Commission) \u00e9tablissant les montants qu\u2019elle doit verser \u00e0 la Municipalit\u00e9 de Chelsea (la Municipalit\u00e9) \u00e0 titre de paiement en remplacement d\u2019imp\u00f4ts (PERI) pour les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9rales qui se situent sur le territoire de la Municipalit\u00e9. Ces montants repr\u00e9sentent environ 50% des montants r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par la Municipalit\u00e9.\n[2] Cet appel soul\u00e8ve des questions importantes pour l\u2019administration du r\u00e9gime des PERI \u00e9tabli par la Loi sur les paiements vers\u00e9s en remplacement d\u2019imp\u00f4ts, L.R.C. 1985, c. M-13 (la LPRI) et le R\u00e8glement sur les paiements vers\u00e9s par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9tat, D.O.R.S.\/81-1030 (le R\u00e8glement). Au nombre de ces questions figurent notamment l\u2019impact des recommandations formul\u00e9es par un Comit\u00e9 consultatif sur le r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends associ\u00e9s aux paiements en remplacement d\u2019imp\u00f4ts (le Comit\u00e9) et le poids que doit leur accorder la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9tat. \u00c9galement en litige est la question de savoir si les contraintes objectives d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019acquisition par une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9tat (en l\u2019occurrence la CCN) de ses biens immeubles doivent \u00eatre prises en consid\u00e9ration dans le calcul de la valeur effective de ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s.\n[3] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nI. CONTEXTE [4] Les faits \u00e0 l\u2019origine du pr\u00e9sent litige ne sont pas contest\u00e9s et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bien r\u00e9sum\u00e9s par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance. Je ne m\u2019en tiendrai donc qu\u2019aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments les plus importants pour une bonne compr\u00e9hension de l\u2019analyse qui va suivre.\n[5] Les terrains au c\u0153ur du pr\u00e9sent litige, dont l\u2019acquisition a d\u00e9but\u00e9 en 1937, sont tous situ\u00e9s dans le Parc de la Gatineau (le Parc). La vocation de ce parc est multiple, et d\u00e9coule notamment d\u2019une volont\u00e9 de \u00ab conserver en permanence pour l\u2019agr\u00e9ment du public les caract\u00e9ristiques naturelles sp\u00e9ciales ainsi que les ressources rares et fragiles repr\u00e9sentatives du Bouclier canadien \u00bb (Plan de la Capitale du Canada 1988, Annexe H, p. 61, Dossier d\u2019appel, p. 3634). C\u2019est le deuxi\u00e8me parc le plus visit\u00e9 au Canada.\n[6] \u00c0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation triennal de 2018 \u00e0 2020, l\u2019appelante a formul\u00e9 des demandes de PERI aupr\u00e8s de la CCN pour ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s situ\u00e9es dans le Parc qui comportaient des augmentations de valeurs au r\u00f4le de l\u2019ordre de 19 % \u00e0 25 %, alors que la moyenne d\u2019augmentation pour l\u2019ensemble des immeubles dans la Municipalit\u00e9 \u00e9tait de 3,9 %. Face \u00e0 ces augmentations consid\u00e9rables, l\u2019\u00e9quipe responsable des PERI de la CCN a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un examen du dossier, et des demandes de justification ont alors \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises \u00e0 la Municipalit\u00e9. En r\u00e9ponse, la CCN a re\u00e7u un tableau de ventes dites \u00ab comparables \u00bb; les terrains ayant fait l\u2019objet de ces ventes \u00e9taient cependant beaucoup plus petits que les vastes terrains en litige, se situaient dans des secteurs pour lesquels le zonage permet le d\u00e9veloppement r\u00e9sidentiel, et avaient dans la majorit\u00e9 des cas \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis par des promoteurs immobiliers pour fins de d\u00e9veloppement. L\u2019\u00e9quipe PERI de la CCN a donc consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que ces ventes ne constituaient pas des ventes \u00ab comparables \u00bb.\n[7] S\u2019en sont suivis plusieurs \u00e9changes et rencontres, sans qu\u2019il soit possible d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 une entente. Face \u00e0 cette impasse, l\u2019appelante a transmis au Comit\u00e9 les 13 septembre 2018 et 24 septembre 2019 des demandes d\u2019avis au sujet des terrains de grande superficie et des terrains de plus petite superficie situ\u00e9s dans des enclaves r\u00e9sidentielles en bordure des lacs Kingsmere et Meech, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur desquelles la construction de r\u00e9sidences est permise. Ces demandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues en novembre 2020.\n[8] Le 16 f\u00e9vrier 2021, le Comit\u00e9 a rendu son Avis (Avis du Comit\u00e9, P-2, Dossier d\u2019appel, p. 130-159). Dans cet Avis, le Comit\u00e9 a notamment conclu que le regroupement des terrains de grande superficie et de certains terrains de petite superficie satisfaisait aux conditions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019article 34 de la Loi sur la fiscalit\u00e9 municipale, R.L.R.Q. c. F-2.1 (la LFM), mais ne l\u2019a pas recommand\u00e9 compte tenu des cons\u00e9quences qu\u2019aurait un tel regroupement sur les cat\u00e9gories d\u2019immeubles et le taux effectif applicable aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s. Quant au calcul de la valeur effective des immeubles, le Comit\u00e9 a majoritairement retenu l\u2019approche de la Municipalit\u00e9 selon laquelle la valeur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s doit \u00eatre bas\u00e9e sur le comportement des acteurs du march\u00e9 immobilier local plut\u00f4t que sur l\u2019usage le meilleur et le plus profitable (UMEPP) des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, soit celui d\u2019espace naturel d\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 la conservation et \u00e0 la r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation. Aux yeux du Comit\u00e9, l\u2019approche de la Municipalit\u00e9 \u00e9tait davantage susceptible de refl\u00e9ter ce que la CCN devrait payer si elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 la fois l\u2019acheteur et le vendeur de ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 44 de la LFM.\n[9] \u00c0 la r\u00e9ception de l\u2019Avis, la CCN a pris acte des recommandations du Comit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la localisation des ventes comparables. Elle \u00e9tait cependant en d\u00e9saccord avec l\u2019opinion du Comit\u00e9 selon laquelle l\u2019UMEPP et la superficie des terrains ne devaient pas \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration dans la d\u00e9termination de la valeur effective des terrains. Par cons\u00e9quent, la CCN a d\u00fb proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des analyses suppl\u00e9mentaires. Elle a ensuite transmis \u00e0 l\u2019appelante les r\u00e9sultats de ses analyses, et l\u2019a invit\u00e9 \u00e0 y r\u00e9pondre avant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision finale ne soit rendue. L\u2019appelante s\u2019y est refus\u00e9e, et ses procureurs ont plut\u00f4t transmis une mise en demeure enjoignant la CCN \u00e0 rendre une d\u00e9cision conforme en tout point \u00e0 l\u2019Avis. En r\u00e9ponse, la CCN a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle consid\u00e9rait l\u2019Avis comme une recommandation, et a de nouveau invit\u00e9 l\u2019appelante \u00e0 commenter son analyse ou \u00e0 lui fournir tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment pertinent. Devant le nouveau refus de l\u2019appelante, le Premier dirigeant de la CCN a rendu sa D\u00e9cision le 19 novembre 2021; c\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette d\u00e9cision que l\u2019appelante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[10] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la CCN reconna\u00eet l\u2019importance de consid\u00e9rer avec s\u00e9rieux les recommandations faites par le Comit\u00e9, tout en soulignant qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e par celles-ci dans la mesure o\u00f9 son r\u00f4le consiste \u00e0 rendre la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019elle consid\u00e8re conforme \u00e0 tous les faits port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance et aux principes applicables. La CCN rappelle \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle doit d\u00e9terminer la valeur et les taux des terrains comme le feraient une autorit\u00e9 \u00e9valuatrice et une autorit\u00e9 taxatrice si ces terrains \u00e9taient sujets \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t foncier. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle pr\u00e9cise ce qui suit :\n[\u2026] consid\u00e9rer les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de la Couronne comme si elles \u00e9taient imposables ne signifie pas qu\u2019il faille les d\u00e9naturer, les d\u00e9pouiller de leurs attributs et contraintes, et leur attribuer un usage hypoth\u00e9tique ou contraire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de cr\u00e9er une fiction quant \u00e0 ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, mais simplement de d\u00e9terminer comment une autorit\u00e9 \u00e9valuatrice les \u00e9valuerait, telles qu\u2019elles sont, si elles \u00e9taient imposables. Ce qui est compens\u00e9 par le r\u00e9gime des PERI, c\u2019est l\u2019immunit\u00e9 fiscale.\nD\u00e9cision du Premier dirigeant de la CCN, Dossier d\u2019appel, p. 101, au para. 13.\n[11] S\u2019appuyant sur les diverses contraintes objectives qui conditionnent et limitent l\u2019usage des terrains en litige, contraintes qui d\u00e9coulent non seulement de la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais \u00e9galement de la l\u00e9gislation qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, de la r\u00e9glementation municipale ainsi que des t\u00e9moignages d\u2019experts selon lesquels tout am\u00e9nagement r\u00e9sidentiel ou commercial s\u2019\u00e9tendrait sur plus de 50 ans, la CCN en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il fallait tenir compte de l\u2019UMEPP des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude, qui est leur usage actuel, soit un espace naturel d\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 la conservation et \u00e0 la r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation (D\u00e9cision de la CCN, aux para. 17-26; Dossier d\u2019appel, pp. 101-106). La CCN a \u00e9galement conclu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait appropri\u00e9 de regrouper plusieurs des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui leur sont adjacentes, puisqu\u2019elles satisfont aux crit\u00e8res de l\u2019article 34 de la LFM (D\u00e9cision de la CCN, aux para. 27-29; Dossier d\u2019appel, p. 106).\n[12] La CCN a par la suite d\u00e9termin\u00e9 la valeur des terrains en utilisant la m\u00e9thode de comparaison, qui consiste \u00e0 identifier sur le march\u00e9 local des transactions portant sur un bien similaire pour en d\u00e9terminer le prix moyen. Le Comit\u00e9, acceptant les pr\u00e9tentions de la Municipalit\u00e9, avait utilis\u00e9 comme ventes comparables des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s vendues \u00e0 des fins de d\u00e9veloppement r\u00e9sidentiel et n\u2019avait pas tenu compte de leur superficie. La CCN a rejet\u00e9 cette comparaison, qui lui paraissait bas\u00e9e sur un usage fictif ni permis ni m\u00eame r\u00e9alisable \u00e0 court ou moyen terme. De l\u2019avis de la CCN, m\u00eame un propri\u00e9taire priv\u00e9 n\u2019accepterait pas d\u2019\u00eatre impos\u00e9 sur une telle valeur. Par cons\u00e9quent, la CCN accepte que les ventes comparables soient des ventes ayant eu lieu sur le territoire de la Municipalit\u00e9, comme l\u2019avait recommand\u00e9 l\u2019expert retenu par la Municipalit\u00e9, mais pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019elles doivent \u00eatre ajust\u00e9es pour tenir compte de l\u2019UMEPP (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire un espace naturel d\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 la conservation et \u00e0 la r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation) et de la superficie. Sur cette base, et apr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 des analyses suppl\u00e9mentaires, la CCN a \u00e9tabli que les terrains de moins de 500 hectares devaient faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un ajustement de 50 % pour l\u2019usage, et que les terrains de 500 \u00e0 1000 hectares et de 1000 \u00e0 1150 hectares devaient respectivement faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un ajustement de 60 % et de 70 % pour l\u2019usage et la superficie. Appliquant ces ajustements, la CCN \u00e9value la valeur effective de ces terrains \u00e0 48 309 700 $ (plut\u00f4t que 106 372 900 $ selon l\u2019\u00e9valuation du Comit\u00e9), ce qui se traduit par des montants \u00e0 verser \u00e0 la Municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de PERI \u00e0 358 119,81 $ pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2018, 370 632,02 $ pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2019, et 383 240,85 $ pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2020. Ces montants repr\u00e9sentent une diminution de plus de 50 % des sommes recommand\u00e9es par le Comit\u00e9.\n[13] Pour ce qui est des petits terrains situ\u00e9s dans les enclaves r\u00e9sidentielles du Parc, la CCN a accept\u00e9 l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9. M\u00eame si ces terrains sont situ\u00e9s dans des quartiers pris\u00e9s, qui sont en partie d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s et dans lesquels la Municipalit\u00e9 permet la construction r\u00e9sidentielle et fournit certains services, il \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir leur valeur en consid\u00e9rant le zonage municipal qui, tout en reconnaissant que ces terrains font partie d\u2019un espace naturel dans lequel les constructions doivent \u00eatre tenues au minimum, permet leur d\u00e9veloppement \u00e0 des fins r\u00e9sidentielles (contrairement aux grands terrains qui font l\u2019objet du pr\u00e9sent litige).\n[14] Dans une d\u00e9cision rendue le 23 janvier 2023, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire log\u00e9e par la Municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette d\u00e9cision de la CCN. Au terme d\u2019un jugement \u00e9toff\u00e9, le juge Pamel a rejet\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tention de la Municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la CCN s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e, par sa conduite, \u00e0 suivre les recommandations du Comit\u00e9 dans son Avis du 16 f\u00e9vrier 2021 et s\u2019est \u00e9galement dit d\u2019avis que la CCN s\u2019\u00e9tait acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a aussi conclu que la d\u00e9cision de la CCN \u00e9tait raisonnable. D\u2019une part, la Cour a rejet\u00e9 les pr\u00e9tentions de la Municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la CCN avait moins d\u2019expertise que le Comit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9valuation fonci\u00e8re, que les proc\u00e9dures devant le Comit\u00e9 rev\u00eatent un caract\u00e8re quasi-judiciaire plut\u00f4t que simplement consultatif, et que l\u2019avis du Comit\u00e9 a un caract\u00e8re contraignant. D\u2019autre part, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a aussi d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la Municipalit\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019objectif des PERI et au paragraphe 16(3) de la LCN, ni que les conclusions de la d\u00e9cision qui s\u2019\u00e9cartent des recommandations du Comit\u00e9 \u00e9taient d\u00e9raisonnables. Je reviendrai sur ces questions dans le cadre de mon analyse des questions en litige devant cette Cour.\nII. R\u00c9GIME L\u00c9GISLATIF APPLICABLE [15] Aux termes de l\u2019article 125 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 (R-U), 30 & 31 Vict., c. 3, la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale jouit d\u2019une immunit\u00e9 fiscale. \u00c0 titre de mandataire de la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Loi sur la capitale nationale, L.R.C. 1985, c. N-4 (LCN), art. 4), la CCN b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de cette immunit\u00e9. C\u2019est donc dire que le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gal de taxation des villes n\u2019est pas applicable \u00e0 ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s. Par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, et en reconnaissance des services offerts par les municipalit\u00e9s au soutien de ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, la CCN peut n\u00e9anmoins verser des PERI aux municipalit\u00e9s depuis 1958 en vertu de l\u2019article 16 de la LCN. Le paragraphe 16(1) pr\u00e9voit en effet que \u00ab la Commission peut verser aux municipalit\u00e9s locales des subventions n\u2019exc\u00e9dant pas le montant des taxes qui pourraient \u00eatre per\u00e7ues par celles-ci sur ses biens immeubles si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mandataire de Sa Majest\u00e9 \u00bb. S\u2019agissant plus particuli\u00e8rement du Parc de la Gatineau, le paragraphe 16(3) pr\u00e9voit que les subventions ne doivent pas exc\u00e9der les montants que la Commission \u00ab estime suffisants pour indemniser [aux autorit\u00e9s comp\u00e9tentes] des pertes de revenu de taxes municipales et scolaires subies par elles pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e en question du fait de l\u2019acquisition de ces biens par la Commission \u00bb.\n[16] Conscient du fait que ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s s\u2019ins\u00e8rent dans le tissu des territoires provinciaux ou municipaux et profitent d\u2019une gamme de services, le l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a par ailleurs mis en place un r\u00e9gime g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de compensation au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des municipalit\u00e9s par le biais de la LPRI et du R\u00e8glement. L\u2019objectif de la LPRI, tel qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son article 2.1, est de pr\u00e9server l\u2019immunit\u00e9 de la Couronne tout en mettant en place un m\u00e9canisme de compensation juste et \u00e9quitable. Elle permet aussi d\u2019uniformiser le r\u00e9gime des PERI pour l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019appareil f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Comme le pr\u00e9cise l\u2019article 15 de la LPRI, le r\u00e9gime des PERI ne conf\u00e8re aucun droit \u00e0 un paiement, et n\u2019a pas pour effet d\u2019assujettir la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation provinciale ou municipale en mati\u00e8re de taxes ou d\u2019imp\u00f4t foncier. Comme le pr\u00e9cisait la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Montr\u00e9al (Ville) c. Administration portuaire de Montr\u00e9al, 2010 CSC 14 au para. 20 [Administration portuaire de Montr\u00e9al] :\n[\u2026] La LPRI \u00e9tablit plut\u00f4t un syst\u00e8me en vertu duquel les municipalit\u00e9s s\u2019attendent \u00e0 recevoir des paiements, mais \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du cadre l\u00e9gislatif et r\u00e9glementaire qu\u2019a institu\u00e9 le Parlement, sans \u00e9carter le principe de l\u2019immunit\u00e9 fiscale. La LPRI veut ainsi concilier des objectifs diff\u00e9rents \u2013 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 fiscale envers les municipalit\u00e9s et la pr\u00e9servation de l\u2019immunit\u00e9 fiscale constitutionnelle \u2013 dont la r\u00e9alisation exige le maintien d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire administratif encadr\u00e9 en ce qui concerne la fixation des paiements de remplacement. [\u2026]\n[17] La LPRI s\u2019applique \u00e0 toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9rales appartenant \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada dont la gestion est confi\u00e9e \u00e0 un ministre f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou \u00e0 une personne morale mentionn\u00e9e \u00e0 ses annexes III ou IV (art. 2). La CCN \u00e9tant mentionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019annexe III, elle est d\u00e8s lors soumise au R\u00e8glement, et ce par d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 toute autre loi (y compris sa loi constitutive) (voir alin\u00e9a 11(1)a) de la LPRI). C\u2019est dire qu\u2019en cas d\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9 entre les modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019article 16 de la LCN et le R\u00e8glement en mati\u00e8re de PERI, c\u2019est le R\u00e8glement qui doit pr\u00e9valoir.\n[18] L\u2019article 6 et le paragraphe 7(1) du R\u00e8glement pr\u00e9voient que les PERI ne doivent pas \u00eatre inf\u00e9rieurs au produit du \u00ab taux effectif \u00bb et de la \u00ab valeur effective \u00bb de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Le R\u00e8glement d\u00e9finit ces deux expressions comme \u00e9tant le taux ou la valeur qui serait applicable si la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait imposable (voir R\u00e8glement, art. 2). En d\u2019autres termes, le R\u00e8glement impose \u00e0 la CCN d\u2019utiliser le r\u00e9gime fiscal local comme cadre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour la d\u00e9termination de la valeur et des taux, ce qui exclut la possibilit\u00e9 de baser les calculs sur un syst\u00e8me fiscal fictif ou arbitraire (Administration portuaire de Montr\u00e9al au para. 40). Au Qu\u00e9bec, c\u2019est dans la LFM et ses r\u00e8glements d\u2019application que l\u2019on retrouve les principes guidant l\u2019\u00e9valuation des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s.\n[19] Lorsque survient un d\u00e9saccord entre une autorit\u00e9 taxatrice et une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9tat concernant la mani\u00e8re dont doivent \u00eatre effectu\u00e9s les calculs visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le montant des PERI, la LPRI pr\u00e9voit la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un comit\u00e9 consultatif ayant pour mandat de donner des avis \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9tat relativement, entre autres, \u00e0 la valeur effective d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, suivant la tenue d\u2019un processus de consultation des parties (LPRI, art. 11.1; R\u00e8glement, art. 12.1).\nIII. QUESTION EN LITIGE [20] \u00c0 mon avis, la seule question en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent appel est celle de savoir si la d\u00e9cision rendue par la CCN est raisonnable. Quant \u00e0 savoir quel poids doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9 et dans quelle mesure ce dernier jouit d\u2019une plus grande expertise que la CCN, ce ne sont l\u00e0 que des consid\u00e9rations contextuelles susceptibles de venir limiter les issues possibles acceptables dans l\u2019application de la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable.\nIV. ANALYSE [21] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que le r\u00f4le de cette Cour, lorsqu\u2019elle si\u00e8ge en appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision en mati\u00e8re de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, consiste essentiellement \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le premier juge a utilis\u00e9 la norme de contr\u00f4le appropri\u00e9e et l\u2019a appliqu\u00e9e correctement : Agraira c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2013 CSC 36 au para. 46; Office r\u00e9gional de la sant\u00e9 du Nord c. Horrocks, 2021 CSC 42 au para. 10; Landry c. Premi\u00e8re Nation des Abenakis de Wolinak, 2021 CAF 197 au para. 57; 11316753 Canada Association c. Canada (Transports), 2023 CAF 28 aux para. 27-28; Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration) c. Solmaz, 2020 CAF 126 au para. 65. En d\u2019autres termes, une cour d\u2019appel doit se mettre dans les souliers de la cour de r\u00e9vision et se concentrer sur la d\u00e9cision administrative.\n[22] Les deux parties ont admis en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale que la norme de r\u00e9vision applicable est celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable, et elles ne remettent pas cette norme en question devant nous. Cette norme commande la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence et la retenue de la part du tribunal de r\u00e9vision; ce dernier doit \u00e9viter de substituer sa propre d\u00e9cision \u00e0 celle du d\u00e9cideur administratif et plut\u00f4t se demander si la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e est fond\u00e9e sur une analyse intrins\u00e8quement coh\u00e9rente et rationnelle et si elle est justifi\u00e9e au regard des contraintes juridiques et factuelles auxquelles le d\u00e9cideur est assujetti (Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65 aux para. 83-86, 101, 102 et 105 [Vavilov]).\n[23] L\u2019appelante a fait valoir plusieurs arguments au soutien de sa pr\u00e9tention que la d\u00e9cision prise par la CCN est d\u00e9raisonnable. J\u2019examinerai dans un premier temps les arguments de la Municipalit\u00e9 selon lesquels l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9 limitait les issues raisonnables auxquels pouvait en arriver la CCN. J\u2019aborderai par la suite les repr\u00e9sentations visant \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que la d\u00e9cision de la CCN serait d\u00e9raisonnable en soi compte tenu du contexte factuel et de l\u2019historique du dossier, ainsi que des contraintes juridiques applicables.\nA. Le r\u00f4le du Comit\u00e9 et le poids de son Avis [24] Comme elle l\u2019a fait en premi\u00e8re instance, la Municipalit\u00e9 a fait valoir que le Comit\u00e9 jouissait d\u2019une plus grande expertise que la CCN en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9valuation fonci\u00e8re et de PERI, ce qui viendrait consid\u00e9rablement r\u00e9duire l\u2019\u00e9tendue du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de l\u2019office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Elle a \u00e9galement soutenu que l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il porte sur des questions tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es et pointues et r\u00e9sulte d\u2019un processus quasi-judiciaire, doit n\u00e9cessairement diminuer de fa\u00e7on significative la marge de man\u0153uvre de la CCN dans sa prise de d\u00e9cision relative aux PERI.\n[25] \u00c0 mon avis, ces arguments ne peuvent \u00eatre retenus, et ce pour plusieurs raisons. Il ne fait aucun doute que le Comit\u00e9 poss\u00e8de une expertise eu \u00e9gard au mandat que lui a confi\u00e9 le Parlement, soit de donner des avis au ministre en cas de d\u00e9saccord sur quatre sujets sp\u00e9cifiques, soit la \u00ab valeur effective \u00bb, la \u00ab dimension effective \u00bb, le \u00ab taux effectif \u00bb, ou lorsqu\u2019une autorit\u00e9 taxatrice est d\u2019avis qu\u2019un suppl\u00e9ment de retard devrait lui \u00eatre vers\u00e9 (au para. 11.1(2) de la LPRI). Il faut en effet pr\u00e9sumer que les membres du Comit\u00e9 poss\u00e8dent une formation ou une exp\u00e9rience pertinente quant aux questions sur lesquelles on lui demande un avis. Ceci dit, la m\u00eame pr\u00e9somption vaut pour la CCN, qui est autoris\u00e9e depuis plus de 60 ans \u00e0 verser des PERI pour le Parc. Je note par ailleurs que le Comit\u00e9 n\u2019a aucune comp\u00e9tence ou expertise particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la LCN, et n\u2019a pas pour mandat d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter les lois ou les r\u00e8glements qui r\u00e9gissent la CCN.\n[26] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, la question de savoir qui de la CCN ou du Comit\u00e9 a davantage d\u2019expertise en mati\u00e8re de PERI m\u2019appara\u00eet \u00eatre un faux d\u00e9bat. Non seulement la preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est-elle t\u00e9nue, mais plus fondamentalement, cette question n\u2019est pas pertinente aux fins d\u2019\u00e9valuer la raisonnabilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision prise par la CCN. Il est vrai, comme l\u2019a reconnu la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, que l\u2019expertise du d\u00e9cideur administratif demeure un facteur pertinent lors de l\u2019exercice du contr\u00f4le judiciaire selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable, m\u00eame si, depuis l\u2019arr\u00eat Vavilov (aux para. 31 et 58), elle ne joue plus dans le choix de la norme de contr\u00f4le. Il n\u2019en demeure pas moins que c\u2019est de l\u2019expertise du d\u00e9cideur dont il peut \u00eatre tenu compte pour comprendre ses motifs, et non de l\u2019expertise d\u2019un organisme charg\u00e9 de formuler un avis pour le d\u00e9cideur. En bout de ligne, c\u2019est \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont le d\u00e9cideur administratif lui-m\u00eame met \u00e0 profit son expertise que la cour de r\u00e9vision doit \u00eatre attentive.\n[27] Ceci m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 traiter du poids qui doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9 dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la raisonnabilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision rendue par la CCN. Malgr\u00e9 les pr\u00e9tentions \u00e0 l\u2019effet contraire de la Municipalit\u00e9, il ne fait aucun doute que l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9 est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment un avis, et non une d\u00e9termination, et que cet Avis ne peut lier le d\u00e9cideur. Ceci ressort du libell\u00e9 m\u00eame de la LPRI. Ce qui est pr\u00e9vu par l\u2019article 11.1, c\u2019est la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un comit\u00e9 \u00ab consultatif \u00bb. Le paragraphe 11.1(2) pr\u00e9cise par ailleurs que le mandat de ce comit\u00e9 est de \u00ab donner des avis \u00bb au ministre ou \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9tat, et ce sur les quatre sujets sp\u00e9cifiques mentionn\u00e9s plus haut au paragraphe 25 des pr\u00e9sents motifs. Quant au R\u00e8glement, la d\u00e9finition que l\u2019on y trouve de la \u00ab valeur effective \u00bb est la valeur qui, \u00ab de l\u2019avis de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb, serait d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par une autorit\u00e9 \u00e9valuatrice si la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude \u00e9tait imposable.\n[28] Compte tenu de cette volont\u00e9 clairement exprim\u00e9e par le l\u00e9gislateur, je vois mal comment on pourrait conclure que le d\u00e9cideur pourrait \u00eatre li\u00e9 par un avis donn\u00e9 par le Comit\u00e9. Cela est encore plus vrai lorsque le Comit\u00e9, comme il l\u2019a fait ici, se permet d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019article 16 de la LCN et sa port\u00e9e sur la valeur des terrains. Le Comit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter la LPRI, comme il le reconna\u00eet lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019article 4.5 de ses r\u00e8gles de pratique, et il faut donc n\u00e9cessairement en d\u00e9duire qu\u2019il est encore moins autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter une autre loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comme la LCN.\n[29] Aucune des d\u00e9cisions invoqu\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante n\u2019appuie ses pr\u00e9tentions. En fait, les arr\u00eats Halifax (Regional Municipality) c. Canada (Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux), 2012 CSC 29 [Halifax], Toronto (Ville) c. Administration portuaire de Toronto, 2010 CF 687, et Administration portuaire de Montr\u00e9al soulevaient plut\u00f4t la question de savoir quel poids il convenait d\u2019accorder aux \u00e9valuations \u00e9tablies par les autorit\u00e9s taxatrices et \u00e9valuatrices. Dans les trois cas, on en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que le point de vue d\u2019une autorit\u00e9 \u00e9valuatrice \u00e9tait un facteur \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration, mais que le dernier mot appartenait au ministre ou \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9tat. Par analogie, on peut faire le m\u00eame raisonnement en ce qui concerne l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9. C\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en est arriv\u00e9e la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, ainsi que dans l\u2019affaire Trois-Rivi\u00e8res (Ville) c. Administration portuaire de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, 2015 CF 106 au para. 68. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 la CCN choisit de s\u2019\u00e9carter des recommandations du Comit\u00e9, il ne fait aucun doute que les explications donn\u00e9es pour ce faire pourront influer sur la raisonnabilit\u00e9 de sa d\u00e9cision. Mais il ne fait aucun doute que le dernier mot revient \u00e0 la CCN. L\u2019opinion du Comit\u00e9 ne peut avoir pour effet de transformer un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en pouvoir li\u00e9. D\u2019ailleurs, il convient de noter que dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Halifax, la Cour supr\u00eame a implicitement reproch\u00e9 au d\u00e9cideur d\u2019avoir suivi aveugl\u00e9ment la recommandation du Comit\u00e9 sans autre analyse. On ne saurait donc conclure au caract\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable de la d\u00e9cision prise par la CCN du seul fait qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9carte de l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9.\n[30] Je m\u2019empresse d\u2019ajouter qu\u2019en l\u2019occurrence, la CCN ne s\u2019est pas content\u00e9e d\u2019ignorer l\u2019Avis de la CCN. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la CCN a reconnu qu\u2019elle devait consid\u00e9rer l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9 avec s\u00e9rieux. Elle a \u00e9galement accept\u00e9 plusieurs des recommandations du Comit\u00e9, notamment celles concernant la valeur des petits terrains, ainsi que celles portant sur l\u2019importance de consid\u00e9rer la localisation des terrains lors de la d\u00e9termination de leur valeur. Il est donc erron\u00e9 de pr\u00e9tendre, comme le fait la Municipalit\u00e9, que le maintien de la d\u00e9cision rendue par la CCN aurait pour effet de priver de toute utilit\u00e9 un recours au Comit\u00e9 ou d\u2019accorder une discr\u00e9tion indue aux offices f\u00e9d\u00e9raux.\n[31] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je suis d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision de la CCN doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e au m\u00e9rite, et que son caract\u00e8re raisonnable doit s\u2019appr\u00e9cier en fonction de ce qui s\u2019y trouve et non \u00e0 l\u2019aulne de l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9. C\u2019est \u00e0 la CCN que revient ultimement la discr\u00e9tion d\u2019\u00e9tablir la valeur des terrains en litige ainsi que les PERI \u00e0 \u00eatre vers\u00e9s \u00e0 la Municipalit\u00e9. Le seul fait que la d\u00e9cision s\u2019\u00e9carte des recommandations formul\u00e9es par le Comit\u00e9 ne saurait rendre cette d\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable. La d\u00e9cision sera raisonnable si elle est justifi\u00e9e au regard des contraintes juridiques et factuelles applicables, et si elle est transparente et intelligible. C\u2019est ce que j\u2019examinerai maintenant.\nB. Le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e [32] L\u2019appelante soutient que la d\u00e9cision de la CCN est d\u00e9raisonnable, tant au niveau de ses conclusions que des motifs \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ces conclusions. Il y a peu \u00e0 dire en ce qui concerne le r\u00e9sultat, que l\u2019appelante attaque du seul fait qu\u2019il serait en contradiction totale avec les recommandations du Comit\u00e9. Tel que j\u2019ai tent\u00e9 de le d\u00e9montrer dans les paragraphes qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, il n\u2019est pas exact de soutenir que la CCN a fait fi de l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9, puisqu\u2019elle a retenu certaines de ses conclusions. Qui plus est, la CCN n\u2019\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e par l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9, et le seul fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas repris \u00e0 son compte toute son analyse ne saurait suffire \u00e0 rendre sa d\u00e9cision d\u00e9raisonnable.\n[33] En ce qui concerne les motifs, la Municipalit\u00e9 invoque plusieurs arguments pour tenter d\u2019en d\u00e9montrer le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable.\n[34] La Municipalit\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend tout d\u2019abord que la CCN avait incit\u00e9 la Municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019adresser au Comit\u00e9 pour faire trancher le diff\u00e9rend relativement aux PERI et qu\u2019elle a ainsi fait na\u00eetre une expectative l\u00e9gitime qu\u2019elle respecterait le processus pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 la LPRI de m\u00eame que les recommandations que lui ferait le Comit\u00e9. \u00c0 ce chapitre, la Municipalit\u00e9 ne fait que reprendre les arguments qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 mis de l\u2019avant devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, sans expliquer en quoi cette derni\u00e8re aurait err\u00e9 en les rejetant.\n[35] \u00c0 la lecture du dossier, je ne vois rien dans les agissements de la CCN qui ait pu faire na\u00eetre une attente l\u00e9gitime quant au r\u00e9sultat du processus. Tout au plus la CCN a-t-elle incit\u00e9 la Municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 saisir le Comit\u00e9 et \u00e0 s\u2019engager dans le processus pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 11.1 de la LPRI, compte tenu du d\u00e9saccord entre les parties. L\u2019e\u00fbt-elle souhait\u00e9, la CCN ne pouvait renoncer \u00e0 exercer le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui conf\u00e8re la LPRI; la jurisprudence confirme par ailleurs qu\u2019une autorit\u00e9 publique ne peut \u00eatre li\u00e9e par des affirmations qui ne respecteraient pas ses obligations l\u00e9gales : Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Mavi, 2011 CSC 30 au para. 68; Centre hospitalier Mont-Sina\u00ef c. Qu\u00e9bec (Ministre de la Sant\u00e9 et des Services sociaux), 2001 CSC 41 au para. 29. Comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, je vois mal comment une partie sophistiqu\u00e9e comme la Municipalit\u00e9, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au surplus par procureurs, aurait pu inf\u00e9rer de la conduite de la CCN une quelconque obligation de suivre l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9 sans y d\u00e9roger d\u2019aucune fa\u00e7on.\n[36] De toute fa\u00e7on, la th\u00e9orie de l\u2019expectative l\u00e9gitime n\u2019a pas pour objet de cr\u00e9er des droits substantifs, et ne constitue que l\u2019un des facteurs contextuels susceptibles de donner naissance \u00e0 des droits de nature proc\u00e9durale: Baker c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), [1999] 2 R.C.S. 817, 1999 CanLII 699 (C.S.C.) aux para. 22 \u00e0 28; Moreau-B\u00e9rub\u00e9 c. Nouveau-Brunswick (Conseil de la magistrature), 2002 CSC 11, [2002] 1 R.C.S. 249 au para. 78. En supposant m\u00eame que les conditions d\u2019application de la th\u00e9orie des attentes l\u00e9gitimes aient \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies, la seule r\u00e9paration qu\u2019une cour de r\u00e9vision pourrait accorder serait donc de nature proc\u00e9durale et aurait pour objet de garantir \u00e0 la partie qui s\u2019estime l\u00e9s\u00e9e les droits qu\u2019emporte l\u2019obligation d\u2019agir avec \u00e9quit\u00e9. Or, il ne fait aucun doute dans le cas pr\u00e9sent que la Municipalit\u00e9 a eu tout le loisir de faire conna\u00eetre son point de vue. La CCN, dans ses lettres du 28 septembre et du 15 octobre 2021, a clairement indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la Municipalit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne se consid\u00e9rait pas li\u00e9e par l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle entendait poursuivre son analyse. Elle a \u00e9galement convi\u00e9 la Municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 lui faire part de ses observations relativement \u00e0 son projet de d\u00e9cision. Bien qu\u2019elle ait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas se pr\u00e9valoir de cette opportunit\u00e9, la Municipalit\u00e9 ne peut pr\u00e9tendre que son droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale a \u00e9t\u00e9 enfreint. J\u2019estime donc que ce premier volet de son argumentation ne peut \u00eatre retenu.\n[37] L\u2019appelante a \u00e9galement soutenu que le processus d\u00e9cisionnel de la CCN est irrationnel et injustifi\u00e9, du fait qu\u2019elle a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 des analyses suppl\u00e9mentaires suite aux observations du Comit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l\u2019UMEPP et \u00e0 la superficie des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, et qu\u2019elle a obtenu un compl\u00e9ment d\u2019expertise de la firme d\u2019\u00e9valuation fonci\u00e8re dont elle avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment retenu les services. En agissant ainsi, la CCN aurait agi de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9raisonnable : non seulement a-t-elle ajout\u00e9 un \u00e9l\u00e9ment additionnel au dossier apr\u00e8s que le Comit\u00e9 ait rendu son avis, mais au surplus la firme en question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e non cr\u00e9dible par le Comit\u00e9. Cela d\u00e9montrerait, toujours selon l\u2019appelante, que le seul objectif de la CCN \u00e9tait de revenir \u00e0 la case d\u00e9part et d\u2019ignorer l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9.\n[38] Avec \u00e9gard, j\u2019estime que les pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019appelante rel\u00e8vent davantage du proc\u00e8s d\u2019intention et ne refl\u00e8tent pas la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Je note tout d\u2019abord que le Comit\u00e9, bien qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas retenu plusieurs des arguments formul\u00e9s par l\u2019expert ind\u00e9pendant, n\u2019a pas rejet\u00e9 l\u2019enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 de son rapport. Le Comit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas davantage remis en question la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la firme pour laquelle l\u2019expert agit. Tout au plus s\u2019est-il interrog\u00e9 sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9marche emprunt\u00e9e par cette firme pour analyser la valeur des terrains de grande superficie ainsi que des conclusions qui en d\u00e9coulent. Or, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019approche retenue par l\u2019expert n\u2019\u00e9tait pas extravagante ni fondamentalement contraire aux principes d\u2019\u00e9valuation fonci\u00e8re. Qui plus est, l\u2019appelante elle-m\u00eame n\u2019a pas remis en question sa qualification d\u2019expert ni son expertise m\u00eame si elle \u00e9tait en d\u00e9saccord avec certaines de ses conclusions.\n[39] J\u2019ajouterais que les analyses suppl\u00e9mentaires effectu\u00e9es par la CCN et le rapport d\u2019expertise suppl\u00e9mentaire sur lequel elle s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e n\u2019ont aucunement enfreint les droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale de l\u2019appelante. La CCN a invit\u00e9 \u00e0 deux reprises la Municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 commenter le contenu de ses analyses compl\u00e9mentaires et les nouvelles valeurs r\u00e9sultant de ses calculs, invitation que la Municipalit\u00e9 a d\u00e9clin\u00e9e au motif que cet exercice serait futile et entra\u00eenerait des co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires. C\u2019est une d\u00e9cision que la Municipalit\u00e9 \u00e9tait certes en droit de prendre, mais elle ne peut maintenant se plaindre de ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue.\n[40] Encore une fois, il convient de rappeler que la d\u00e9cision finale appartient \u00e0 la CCN, et que la LPRI est silencieuse quant au processus d\u00e9cisionnel ou \u00e0 la preuve dont elle peut tenir compte pour s\u2019acquitter de son mandat. Certes, l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9 est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important dont doit tenir compte un d\u00e9cideur, et il va de soi que les justifications invoqu\u00e9es par le d\u00e9cideur pour s\u2019en \u00e9carter seront prises en consid\u00e9ration par la Cour saisie d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Il n\u2019en demeure pas moins que la d\u00e9cision finale appartenait \u00e0 la CCN dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, et que cette derni\u00e8re pouvait poursuivre son analyse et obtenir des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord avec l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9. C\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qu\u2019elle a fait ici, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 pouvoir tenir compte de l\u2019UMEPP et de la superficie dont n\u2019avait pas tenu compte le Comit\u00e9 dans son Avis.\n[41] L\u2019appelante soutient \u00e9galement que la d\u00e9cision de la CCN est d\u00e9raisonnable parce qu\u2019elle fait fi des enseignements du Comit\u00e9, tant sur la question du regroupement des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s que sur celle de leur valeur effective, et qu\u2019elle revient pour l\u2019essentiel \u00e0 la valeur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu\u2019elle avait initialement propos\u00e9e et qu\u2019avait rejet\u00e9e le Comit\u00e9. Aux yeux de l\u2019appelante, la CCN a tent\u00e9 de donner \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision une apparence de raisonnabilit\u00e9 en se basant sur les ventes comparables retenues par l\u2019expert de la Municipalit\u00e9, pour ensuite proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des ajustements consid\u00e9rables (l\u2019UMEPP et la superficie) qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Comit\u00e9 et qui sont bas\u00e9s sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments nouveaux.\n[42] La d\u00e9cision de la CCN ne saurait \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de d\u00e9raisonnable du seul fait qu\u2019elle ne reprend pas int\u00e9gralement les conclusions du Comit\u00e9 et que la valeur effective des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s sur la base de laquelle sont \u00e9tablis les PERI ultimement vers\u00e9s \u00e0 la Municipalit\u00e9 se rapproche de la valeur initialement attribu\u00e9e par la CCN. Pour avoir gain de cause, la Municipalit\u00e9 devait d\u00e9montrer que la d\u00e9cision de la CCN \u00e9tait intrins\u00e8quement d\u00e9raisonnable et ne respectait pas les principes d\u2019\u00e9valuation fonci\u00e8re. Or, comme en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Municipalit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas fait cette d\u00e9monstration et n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 en quoi la d\u00e9cision de la CCN, et notamment la prise en compte des contraintes objectives affectant les terrains en litige, n\u2019est pas conforme au r\u00e9gime des PERI et s\u2019\u00e9carte des principes qui se d\u00e9gagent de la jurisprudence en la mati\u00e8re. C\u2019est l\u00e0 le n\u0153ud du litige dans le cadre de cet appel, et c\u2019est \u00e0 cette question que je consacrerai l\u2019analyse qui va suivre.\n[43] L\u2019appelante s\u2019appuie sur la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019affaire Halifax pour soutenir que la discr\u00e9tion conf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la CCN dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de ses PERI n\u2019est pas sans limites, et que la r\u00e9duction de 50 % de la valeur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s contredit \u00e0 la fois la lettre et l\u2019esprit du r\u00e9gime des PERI et l\u2019article 16(3) de la LCN. Elle reproche plus particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la CCN d\u2019avoir bas\u00e9 son \u00e9valuation en se fondant sur les contraintes li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa mission et \u00e0 la localisation des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dans le Parc de la Gatineau, ce qui irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019objet du paragraphe 16(3) qui est de compenser les pertes de revenus de taxes li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s exemptes de taxes.\n[44] L\u2019appelante ne remet pas en question le point de d\u00e9part de l\u2019exercice auquel doit se livrer la CCN dans le calcul de ses PERI. Les d\u00e9finitions de \u00ab taux effectif \u00bb et de \u00ab valeur effective \u00bb que pr\u00e9voient la LPRI et le R\u00e8glement \u00e9tablissent clairement que le r\u00e9gime local d\u2019imp\u00f4ts fonciers qui serait applicable si la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en cause \u00e9tait une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 imposable est le facteur de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Le \u00ab taux effectif \u00bb s\u2019entend du taux de l\u2019imp\u00f4t foncier qui serait applicable si la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9tait imposable, alors que la \u00ab valeur effective \u00bb est la valeur qu\u2019une autorit\u00e9 \u00e9valuatrice d\u00e9terminerait comme base du calcul de l\u2019imp\u00f4t foncier qui serait applicable \u00e0 une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale si celle-ci \u00e9tait une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 imposable. L\u2019article 2 de la LPRI d\u00e9finit par ailleurs l\u2019\u00ab autorit\u00e9 taxatrice \u00bb comme la \u00ab municipalit\u00e9 ou province, organisme municipal ou provincial, ou autre autorit\u00e9 qui, sous le r\u00e9gime d\u2019une loi provinciale, l\u00e8ve et per\u00e7oit un imp\u00f4t foncier \u2026 \u00bb.\n[45] Bien que l\u2019\u00e9valuation faite par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 \u00e9valuatrice constitue le point de d\u00e9part pour \u00e9tablir les PERI, elle ne saurait en aucun cas lier la CCN, qui conserve toujours le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de d\u00e9terminer la valeur effective qui sera utilis\u00e9e dans le calcul des paiements de remplacement. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame dans les arr\u00eats Administration portuaire de Montr\u00e9al (aux para. 22 et 33-35) et Halifax (aux para. 40-42), le calcul des PERI ne saurait se r\u00e9duire \u00e0 la simple application m\u00e9canique des \u00e9valuations et des taux d\u2019imposition d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par la municipalit\u00e9. S\u2019il en va ainsi, c\u2019est parce que la LPRI maintient le principe de l\u2019immunit\u00e9 fiscale de l\u2019\u00c9tat f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, mais aussi pour que le ministre puisse assurer une certaine coh\u00e9rence \u00e0 travers le pays tout en tenant compte de la diversit\u00e9 et de la nature unique des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, et m\u00eame au besoin pour qu\u2019il puisse prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats f\u00e9d\u00e9raux contre des municipalit\u00e9s qui utiliseraient leur pouvoir de taxation de mauvaise foi.\n[46] Enfin, il convient de souligner que dans l\u2019exercice de sa discr\u00e9tion, le ministre ou la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Couronne ne peut effectuer ses calculs en se basant sur un syst\u00e8me fiscal fictif. La LPRI et le R\u00e8glement pr\u00e9voient en effet que le calcul du taux d\u2019imposition et de la valeur effective doit se faire comme si la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9tait une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 imposable entre les mains d\u2019un propri\u00e9taire priv\u00e9. Cette exigence d\u00e9coule non seulement de l\u2019article 2 du R\u00e8glement et de la disposition correspondante de la LPRI, mais \u00e9galement de l\u2019objectif m\u00eame d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de justice envers les municipalit\u00e9s canadiennes qui sous-tend ce r\u00e9gime.\n[47] C\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la raison pour laquelle la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Halifax, que l\u2019attribution d\u2019une valeur nominale \u00e0 un terrain situ\u00e9 au centre-ville d\u2019Halifax \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable. Dans cette affaire, le Comit\u00e9 consultatif avait attribu\u00e9 une valeur nominale de 10 $ \u00e0 un terrain de 42 acres qui constituait un lieu historique national. La Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que la d\u00e9cision du ministre, qui avait ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9, \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable pour deux raisons. D\u2019une part, le ministre avait attribu\u00e9 au terrain en litige une valeur nominale uniquement en raison de l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9velopper ce terrain du fait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme lieu historique national. Or, l\u2019autorit\u00e9 \u00e9valuatrice comp\u00e9tente n\u2019avait pas utilis\u00e9 cette m\u00e9thode d\u2019\u00e9valuation, et rien dans la preuve soumise au ministre ne montrait qu\u2019une quelconque autorit\u00e9 \u00e9valuatrice au Canada n\u2019avait utilis\u00e9 une telle m\u00e9thode pour \u00e9valuer des sites de cette nature. Bien que le ministre n\u2019\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9 par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 \u00e9valuatrice comp\u00e9tente, cette derni\u00e8re devait quand m\u00eame servir de facteur de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. En agissant comme il l\u2019a fait, le ministre se trouvait donc \u00e0 baser son \u00e9valuation sur un syst\u00e8me fiscal fictif qu\u2019il avait lui-m\u00eame cr\u00e9\u00e9.\n[48] D\u2019autre part, la d\u00e9cision du ministre \u00e9tait \u00e9galement d\u00e9raisonnable du fait qu\u2019elle allait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019objet m\u00eame de la LPRI. Comme le souligne avec raison la Cour supr\u00eame, la position du ministre selon laquelle un lieu historique national est sans valeur parce qu\u2019il ne peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 des fins commerciales heurte de plein fouet l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur d\u2019inclure les lieux historiques nationaux dans le r\u00e9gime des PERI : Halifax aux para. 47 et 52-57.\n[49] La Cour supr\u00eame a cependant bien pris soin de pr\u00e9ciser que sa d\u00e9cision ne devait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme retirant au ministre tout pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, ou comme l\u2019emp\u00eachant de tenir compte des contraintes qui restreignent l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou qui d\u00e9coulent de leur possession par la CCN, comme semble le sugg\u00e9rer l\u2019appelante aux paragraphes 71, 72 et 74 de son m\u00e9moire. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le dernier paragraphe de l\u2019analyse de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Halifax m\u2019appara\u00eet on ne peut plus clair et m\u00e9rite, dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, d\u2019\u00eatre reproduit au long :\n[58] D\u00e9terminer pour les besoins d\u2019une \u00e9valuation la valeur marchande d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dont l\u2019utilisation optimale est celle d\u2019un lieu historique national repr\u00e9sente un d\u00e9fi de taille. M\u00eame si j\u2019ai conclu que la fa\u00e7on dont le ministre a abord\u00e9 cette t\u00e2che \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable, compte tenu du dossier dont il \u00e9tait saisi, je ne dis aucunement dans ces motifs que j\u2019approuve ou que j\u2019adopte une m\u00e9thode en particulier \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce d\u00e9licat probl\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9valuation. Je ne laisse pas non plus entendre que le ministre, pour agir raisonnablement en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tait tenu d\u2019adopter la m\u00e9thode d\u2019\u00e9valuation pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e par la municipalit\u00e9 ou qu\u2019il ne devait pas prendre en compte des restrictions \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation inh\u00e9rentes \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation optimale de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en tant que lieu historique national. La preuve qui sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au ministre dans l\u2019affaire pr\u00e9cise, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e en fonction des obligations que la Loi lui impose et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des motifs qu\u2019il donne dans l\u2019exercice particulier de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, d\u00e9terminera si la d\u00e9marche qu\u2019il adopte est raisonnable.\n[50] C\u2019est \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces consid\u00e9rations qu\u2019il faut maintenant \u00e9valuer la d\u00e9cision prise par la CCN. Au Qu\u00e9bec, c\u2019est la LFM qui encadre la confection du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation fonci\u00e8re. Les dispositions cl\u00e9s de cette loi pour nos fins sont les articles 45 et 46, que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a d\u2019ailleurs cit\u00e9s dans son jugement. On y pr\u00e9cise que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir la valeur r\u00e9elle d\u2019une unit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation sont les suivants : 1) l\u2019utilisation qui peut le plus probablement \u00eatre faite de l\u2019unit\u00e9 et les conditions du march\u00e9 immobilier au moment pr\u00e9cis de leur \u00e9valuation (1er juillet 2016 dans le cadre de notre dossier); 2) si l\u2019unit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation n\u2019est pas susceptible de faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une vente, le prix que la personne au nom de laquelle elle est inscrite serait justifi\u00e9e de payer si elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 la fois l\u2019acheteur et le vendeur; 3) l\u2019incidence sur le prix de vente de l\u2019unit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation consid\u00e9rant les avantages ou d\u00e9savantages qu\u2019elle peut apporter de fa\u00e7on objective; et 4) l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019unit\u00e9, incluant son \u00e9tat physique, sa situation au point de vue \u00e9conomique et juridique et l\u2019environnement dans lequel elle se trouve.\n[51] Sur la base de ces dispositions, la jurisprudence et la doctrine qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise sont \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape \u00e0 franchir pour estimer la valeur r\u00e9elle d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 consiste \u00e0 en d\u00e9terminer l\u2019UMEPP. Ce concept est commun\u00e9ment d\u00e9fini comme \u00ab l\u2019utilisation raisonnable, probable et l\u00e9gale d\u2019une unit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation, qui se r\u00e9v\u00e8le possible sous le plan physique, \u00e9tay\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e, r\u00e9alisable sur le plan financier et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019unit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation sa valeur la plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e \u00bb : voir Desjardins, Jean-Guy, Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9valuation fonci\u00e8re, Montr\u00e9al, Wilson & Lafleur, 1992, p. 31 [Desjardins 1992]. Les normes de pratique professionnelle de l\u2019Ordre des \u00e9valuateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec (Page Intro-9) pr\u00e9cisent par ailleurs que l\u2019\u00e9valuateur doit d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019usage le meilleur r\u00e9pond aux conditions suivantes :\n-Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un usage possible sur le plan physique;\n-Il doit \u00eatre permis par les r\u00e8glements et par la loi;\n-Il doit \u00eatre financi\u00e8rement possible;\n-Il doit pouvoir se concr\u00e9tiser \u00e0 court terme;\n-Il doit \u00eatre reli\u00e9 aux probabilit\u00e9s de r\u00e9alisation plut\u00f4t qu\u2019aux simples possibilit\u00e9s;\n-Il doit exister une demande pour le bien \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 son meilleur usage; et\n-L\u2019usage doit \u00eatre le plus profitable.\n(Voir aussi : Ordre des \u00e9valuateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec, Les normes de pratique professionnelle des \u00e9valuateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s, R\u00e8gle 1.2, Norme 1, \u00c9l\u00e9ment 11, p. 1921; Fernand Gilbert lt\u00e9e c.

Les contraintes de nature juridique, \u00e9conomique, environnementale ou autres qui viennent restreindre l\u2019usage d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ont \u00e9videmment un impact sur sa valeur. En effet, les usages envisag\u00e9s \u00e0 titre d\u2019UMEPP ne doivent pas \u00eatre hypoth\u00e9tiques, et doivent donc \u00eatre r\u00e9alistes \u00e0 court ou moyen terme et permis par la loi et les r\u00e8glements : Desjardins 2021, p. 40.\n[53] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ces principes, que l\u2019appelante ne remet pas en question, la CCN a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019examen des contraintes de toutes sortes auxquelles sont assujetties les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude, et a conclu que l\u2019UMEPP des grandes superficies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude est clairement celui de leur usage actuel, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire un espace naturel d\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 la conservation et \u00e0 la r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation. Pour en arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, la CCN a tenu compte des facteurs suivants :\n-Les contraintes contenues dans le r\u00e9gime statutaire f\u00e9d\u00e9ral qui limitent le d\u00e9veloppement des terrains. Tout projet ou d\u00e9cision de la CCN au sujet du changement d\u2019affectation ou de la vente potentielle de tout terrain f\u00e9d\u00e9ral faisant partie du Parc n\u00e9cessite l\u2019approbation pr\u00e9alable de la CCN en vertu de la LCN (arts. 12 et 12.1). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il importe d\u2019insister sur le fait que les d\u00e9cisions de la CCN doivent \u00eatre compatibles avec le mandat que lui a confi\u00e9 la LCN et avec les orientations contenues dans le Plan Directeur du Parc de la Gatineau. Il ne s\u2019agit donc pas, comme le sugg\u00e8re l\u2019appelante, de contraintes subjectives que la CCN s\u2019est elle-m\u00eame impos\u00e9es. De fait, toute d\u00e9cision de la CCN qui ne serait pas compatible avec le mandat que lui a confi\u00e9 le Parlement pourrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9e en r\u00e9vision judiciaire au motif qu\u2019elle ne fait pas partie des issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit : Gatineau (Ville) c. Commission de la capitale nationale, 2013 CF 439 au para. 38;\n-Les contraintes li\u00e9es au r\u00e9gime juridique qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. En vertu de son inscription au registre du Ministre provincial du D\u00e9veloppement durable, de l\u2019Environnement et des Parcs, d\u2019autres contraintes viennent s\u2019attacher aux terrains formant le Parc en vertu de la Loi sur la conservation du patrimoine naturel, R.L.R.Q. c. C-61.01. L\u2019article 5 de cette derni\u00e8re loi pr\u00e9voit en effet que des terrains faisant partie d\u2019une aire prot\u00e9g\u00e9e inscrite au registre susmentionn\u00e9 ne peuvent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un changement d\u2019affectation, d\u2019une vente, d\u2019un \u00e9change ou d\u2019une autre transaction qui modifie son statut de protection \u00e0 moins que le ministre du D\u00e9veloppement durable, de l\u2019Environnement et des Parcs n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement consult\u00e9. Une telle contrainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite comme une servitude l\u00e9gale de droit public qui affecte la valeur r\u00e9elle d\u2019un immeuble : voir Sidcan inc. c. Lee, 2000 CanLII 7010 (Q.C.C.A.), aux para. 19-22. Et comme l\u2019a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Qu\u00e9bec c. La fondation Bagatelle Inc., 2001 CanLII 15060 (Q.C.C.A.) au para. 23, de telles contraintes ne peuvent \u00eatre assimil\u00e9es \u00e0 des contraintes qu\u2019un propri\u00e9taire s\u2019impose volontairement. Elles sont plut\u00f4t impos\u00e9es dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la collectivit\u00e9, et doivent \u00eatre prises en consid\u00e9ration dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9;\n-Les contraintes contenues dans la r\u00e9glementation municipale. Tel que le note la CCN dans sa d\u00e9cision, la Municipalit\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019orientation principale de conservation et de territoire naturel du Parc. En fait, le sch\u00e9ma d\u2019am\u00e9nagement (Dossier d\u2019appel, vol. 21, annexe \u00ab R \u00bb), le plan d\u2019urbanisme et le r\u00e8glement de zonage (R\u00e8glement num\u00e9ro 635-05, Dossier d\u2019appel, vol. 22, annexes \u00ab S \u00bb et \u00ab T \u00bb) sont compatibles avec les orientations identifi\u00e9es au Plan de la Capitale nationale et pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es au Plan directeur du parc de la Gatineau. Il est d\u2019ailleurs int\u00e9ressant de constater qu\u2019un plan particulier d\u2019urbanisme adopt\u00e9 par la municipalit\u00e9 en 2011 identifie les secteurs r\u00e9sidentiels que la municipalit\u00e9 souhaite d\u00e9velopper, qui se trouvent tous \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Parc (Dossier d\u2019appel, vol. 20, Annexe \u00ab Q \u00bb, Secteur central de la municipalit\u00e9 de Chelsea \u2013 PPU et r\u00e8glements de concordance). Or, les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude ne se trouvent pas dans ces secteurs, et il n\u2019y a aucune preuve au dossier \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la Municipalit\u00e9 ait jamais souhait\u00e9 d\u00e9velopper ces secteurs; et\n-Les contraintes de nature territoriale. Certaines parcelles des terrains \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude ont \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9es \u00e0 la Couronne par le tr\u00e8s honorable William Lyon Mackenzie King. Or, le don pr\u00e9voit que ces terrains sont c\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00ab in trust \u00bb \u00e0 des fins de conservation pour des temps imm\u00e9moriaux pour le bien public (Dossier d\u2019appel, vol. 23, Annexe \u00ab W \u00bb).\n[54] Il r\u00e9sulte de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de que de nombreuses contraintes de nature objective gr\u00e8vent les terrains \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude et en affectent les valeurs effectives. L\u2019appelante ne conteste pas ces facteurs, mais soutient que la vocation de parc et d\u2019aire de conservation des terrains qui font l\u2019objet du pr\u00e9sent litige est purement subjective et ne repose que sur le choix de la CCN de maintenir ces terrains comme parc dans l\u2019exercice de sa mission. Dans son m\u00e9moire, la Municipalit\u00e9 affirme que la CCN ne pouvait raisonnablement se baser sur les contraintes qui d\u00e9coulent de sa possession des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s pour \u00e9tablir le montant des PERI, et qu\u2019une telle d\u00e9cision ne serait pas conforme aux enseignements de l\u2019arr\u00eat Halifax.\n[55] Or, les paragraphes qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent d\u00e9montrent que la valeur attribu\u00e9e aux terrains vis\u00e9s par la CCN n\u2019est pas arbitraire ou purement subjective. Elle d\u00e9coule au contraire du mandat que le Parlement lui-m\u00eame a confi\u00e9 \u00e0 la CCN, ainsi que de la propre r\u00e9glementation de l\u2019appelante. En fait, la preuve d\u00e9montre que la Municipalit\u00e9 souscrit aux objectifs de la CCN et que le d\u00e9veloppement des terrains en cause \u00e0 des fins r\u00e9sidentielles est purement hypoth\u00e9tique. Deux des experts qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Comit\u00e9, dont le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la firme d\u2019\u00e9valuateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s qui a sign\u00e9 les r\u00f4les d\u2019\u00e9valuation de la Municipalit\u00e9 r\u00e9gionale de comt\u00e9 (MRC) dont fait partie la Municipalit\u00e9, ont d\u2019ailleurs affirm\u00e9 que tout am\u00e9nagement r\u00e9sidentiel ou commercial mettrait 50, voire 100 ans avant de se concr\u00e9tiser \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la grande superficie des terrains et autres contraintes li\u00e9es \u00e0 ces lieux : voir T\u00e9moignage de Marc L\u00e9pine le 17 novembre 2020, Dossier d\u2019appel, pp. 5625 et 5667; T\u00e9moignage de Neil Gold le 19 novembre 2020, Dossier d\u2019appel, pp. 6205-6206.\n[56] Comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, je suis donc d\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9raisonnable pour la CCN de conclure que l\u2019UMEPP des terrains dont l\u2019\u00e9valuation est contest\u00e9e est celle d\u2019un espace naturel d\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 la conservation et \u00e0 la r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation. Le d\u00e9veloppement r\u00e9sidentiel dont ces terrains pourraient \u00e9ventuellement faire l\u2019objet est purement hypoth\u00e9tique compte tenu des nombreuses contraintes qui les affectent, ainsi que du contexte historique et de la g\u00e9ographie. Comme la LPRI et le R\u00e8glement exigent que les terrains en cause soient \u00e9valu\u00e9s comme s\u2019ils \u00e9taient des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s imposables dans les mains d\u2019un contribuable, leur valeur ne pouvait donc \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e sur la base d\u2019un syst\u00e8me fiscal fictif ou arbitraire (Administration portuaire de Montr\u00e9al au para. 40). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, et \u00e0 l\u2019instar du juge de premi\u00e8re instance, je souscris enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019argumentation de la CCN \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la d\u00e9termination des PERI par un d\u00e9cideur ne consiste pas \u00e0 cr\u00e9er une chim\u00e8re du simple fait que les terrains \u00e9valu\u00e9s appartiennent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat, \u00e0 les d\u00e9naturer, \u00e0 les d\u00e9pouiller de leurs attributs et contraintes et \u00e0 leur attribuer un usage hypoth\u00e9tique contraire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 et aux souhaits des parties. Cette approche me para\u00eet tout \u00e0 fait compatible avec la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Halifax, dans laquelle la Cour reconnaissait qu\u2019un d\u00e9cideur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu d\u2019ignorer les restrictions \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation inh\u00e9rentes \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation optimale d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e comme lieu historique national (ou, comme c\u2019est le cas ici, pour des fins de conservation et de r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation) pour que sa d\u00e9cision puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e raisonnable.\n[57] Enfin, l\u2019appelante tente de s\u2019\u00e9carter de l\u2019UMEPP en pr\u00e9textant que les principes d\u2019\u00e9valuation fonci\u00e8re normalement applicables doivent \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9s en raison du paragraphe 16(3) de la LCN. Tel que je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9 (voir para. 17 des pr\u00e9sents motifs), cet argument ne peut \u00eatre retenu du fait de la clause d\u00e9rogatoire pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 11(1) de la LPRI. Il n\u2019y aurait d\u2019ailleurs aucune logique \u00e0 ce que le Parc de la Gatineau soit soumis \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime distinct, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 comme une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 imposable selon le r\u00e9gime local d\u2019imp\u00f4ts fonciers au m\u00eame titre que toute autre propri\u00e9t\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[58] Quant au regroupement de certaines propri\u00e9t\u00e9s avec les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s adjacentes, l\u2019article 34 de la LFM pr\u00e9voit que quatre conditions doivent \u00eatre remplies. Le principe directeur qui doit \u00eatre gard\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019esprit en appliquant cette disposition est qu\u2019une unit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation doit regrouper le plus grand ensemble possible d\u2019immeubles, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9viter la multiplication des unit\u00e9s. Le Comit\u00e9 avait reconnu que les terrains consid\u00e9r\u00e9s satisfaisaient aux quatre crit\u00e8res pr\u00e9vus par la LPRI, mais avait n\u00e9anmoins estim\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ne devraient pas \u00eatre regroup\u00e9s pour un motif qui n\u2019est pas mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 34. La CCN s\u2019est \u00e9cart\u00e9e de cette recommandation et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de regrouper sept propri\u00e9t\u00e9s avec les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s adjacentes. Ces regroupements impliquent de petits terrains, faisant partie des enclaves r\u00e9sidentielles, contigus \u00e0 d\u2019autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de grandes superficies, et sont semblables \u00e0 d\u2019autres regroupements r\u00e9alis\u00e9s dans le pass\u00e9 par la MRC dont rel\u00e8ve la Municipalit\u00e9. Comme l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 en quoi cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable et n\u2019a avanc\u00e9 aucun argument qui permettrait de remettre en question la d\u00e9cision de la CCN \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, il ne m\u2019appara\u00eet pas n\u00e9cessaire de m\u2019attarder davantage sur cette question.\n[59] Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9termin\u00e9 l\u2019UMEPP des terrains et proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 certains regroupements, la CCN a \u00e9tabli leur valeur en utilisant la m\u00e9thode de comparaison. C\u2019est \u00e9galement la m\u00e9thode qu\u2019avait retenue le Comit\u00e9, et c\u2019est l\u2019une des m\u00e9thodes d\u2019\u00e9valuation les plus couramment utilis\u00e9es du fait de sa relative simplicit\u00e9. Elle refl\u00e8te \u00e9galement le r\u00e9sultat le plus fiable quant \u00e0 la valeur r\u00e9elle d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du fait qu\u2019elle s\u2019appuie sur une preuve directe provenant des donn\u00e9es du march\u00e9 : Les Entreprises Monlavert Inc. c. Mont-Tremblant (Ville), 2021 QCTAQ 06200 au para. 49. Cette m\u00e9thode consiste \u00e0 chercher sur le march\u00e9 local des transactions portant sur un bien similaire \u00e0 celui devant \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9, \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le prix moyen qui ressort de ces transactions, et \u00e0 appliquer ce prix moyen au bien \u00e0 \u00e9valuer : Desjardins 1992, p. 153. Les ventes comparables utilis\u00e9es dans le cadre de cette m\u00e9thode doivent \u00eatre soumises aux m\u00eames contraintes que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en litige, notamment quant \u00e0 l\u2019usage, la localisation et la superficie.\n[60] Puisqu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de ventes locales r\u00e9ellement comparables d\u00e9tenant des caract\u00e9ristiques similaires ou identiques, l\u2019expert retenu par la CCN avait choisi des terrains ayant sensiblement la m\u00eame vocation que le Parc dans tout le Qu\u00e9bec et m\u00eame en Ontario. Le Comit\u00e9 a rejet\u00e9 cette approche, notamment parce que les terrains choisis \u00e9taient beaucoup plus \u00e9loign\u00e9s des centres urbains que ceux dont il est question ici. L\u2019expert retenu par la Municipalit\u00e9 avait plut\u00f4t retenu la vente de terrains comparables sur le march\u00e9 local, et c\u2019est \u00e9galement la m\u00e9thode qu\u2019a suivie le Comit\u00e9. La CCN a pris acte de cette recommandation et s\u2019est \u00e9galement concentr\u00e9e sur des ventes comparables refl\u00e9tant le march\u00e9 local.\n[61] Dans son Avis, le Comit\u00e9 ne tenait cependant pas compte de la superficie et de l\u2019usage des terrains faisant l\u2019objet des ventes identifi\u00e9es comme comparables, tenant pour acquis que leur utilisation optimale serait une valeur purement \u00e9conomique \u00e9tablie sans tenir compte de leurs caract\u00e9ristiques propres et des contraintes de toutes sortes qui s\u2019y rattachent. Or, les ventes comparables utilis\u00e9es par l\u2019expert de la Municipalit\u00e9 et qu\u2019a retenues le Comit\u00e9 portaient sur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s plus de vingt fois plus petites en moyenne que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en question, et situ\u00e9es dans des secteurs o\u00f9 le zonage permettait le d\u00e9veloppement r\u00e9sidentiel et m\u00eame commercial dans certains cas (Note de breffage au Premier dirigeant, Dossier Appel, p. 3421 au para. 222).\n[62] Suite aux analyses subs\u00e9quentes effectu\u00e9es par l\u2019\u00e9quipe charg\u00e9e de d\u00e9terminer les PERI \u00e0 la CCN, un bar\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli pour d\u00e9terminer les ajustements requis \u00e0 la valeur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en consid\u00e9ration de la superficie et de l\u2019UMEPP. Pour les terrains de moins de 500 hectares, on a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un ajustement de 50% pour l\u2019usage. Pour les terrains de 500 \u00e0 1 000 hectares et de 1 000 \u00e0 1 500 hectares, on a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 des ajustements respectifs de 60 % et de 70 % pour l\u2019usage et la superficie. La CCN soutient que ces valeurs, qui totalisent un montant global de 48 309 700 $ pour l\u2019ensemble de ses terrains se trouvant sur la Municipalit\u00e9, repr\u00e9sentent les valeurs qu\u2019une autorit\u00e9 \u00e9valuatrice aurait d\u00e9termin\u00e9es en date du 1er juillet 2016 si ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e9taient imposables, lorsque l\u2019on tient compte de leur localisation, de leur superficie et de l\u2019UMEPP propres \u00e0 ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s.\n[63] Bien que la CCN lui ait donn\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de commenter son analyse et ses d\u00e9terminations, la Municipalit\u00e9 s\u2019est abstenue de le faire et a plut\u00f4t r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par voie de mise en demeure une d\u00e9cision conforme en tout point \u00e0 l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9. Plut\u00f4t que de contester la d\u00e9marche et les ajustements retenus par la CCN et d\u2019expliquer pourquoi les montants \u00e0 verser \u00e0 la Municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de PERI seraient d\u00e9raisonnables, cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019est content\u00e9e de critiquer la CCN pour avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 des analyses suppl\u00e9mentaires apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019Avis, et pour avoir eu recours au m\u00eame expert que devant le Comit\u00e9. Cela n\u2019a pas convaincu la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et ne me convainc pas davantage.\n[64] Tout bien consid\u00e9r\u00e9, la d\u00e9cision de la CCN est transparente et intelligible, et appartient aux issues possibles pouvant se justifier au regard des contraintes juridiques et factuelles applicables. Encore une fois, la CCN n\u2019\u00e9tait li\u00e9e ni par l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 taxatrice ni par l\u2019Avis du Comit\u00e9, et pouvait en arriver \u00e0 sa propre d\u00e9termination de ce qui constituait la valeur des terrains en litige qu\u2019une autorit\u00e9 \u00e9valuatrice d\u00e9terminerait si ces terrains \u00e9taient des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s imposables. Certes, la valeur attribu\u00e9e aux terrains par la Municipalit\u00e9, dans un premier temps, et par le Comit\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment, constituait pour la CCN un point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Le d\u00e9cideur pouvait cependant y d\u00e9roger, \u00e0 condition de s\u2019en expliquer en fournissant des motifs qui r\u00e9pondent aux exigences de la raisonnabilit\u00e9. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Halifax, le ministre ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9charg\u00e9 de son fardeau en n\u2019attribuant qu\u2019une valeur nominale \u00e0 une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 assujettie \u00e0 la LPRI, contrecarrant du m\u00eame coup \u00e0 l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, la CCN n\u2019a pas commis cette erreur et a bien expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi elle divergeait d\u2019opinion avec le Comit\u00e9 \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards; elle a vers\u00e9 des montants substantiels de PERI \u00e0 la Municipalit\u00e9 sur la base d\u2019une \u00e9valuation de la valeur effective des terrains repr\u00e9sentant approximativement la moiti\u00e9 de la valeur recommand\u00e9e par le Comit\u00e9, au terme d\u2019une analyse rigoureuse respectueuse de la LPRI et conforme \u00e0 la preuve.\nV. CONCLUSION [65] Pour tous les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, avec d\u00e9pens.\n\u00ab Yves de Montigny \u00bb\nJuge en chef\n\u00ab Je suis d\u2019accord.\nGeorge R.

La Division d\u2019appel, infirmant la Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, a conclu que les demandeurs n\u2019\u00e9taient pas admissibles aux prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi pendant la p\u00e9riode de fermeture des vacances de la construction de leur employeur et ce, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 11(3) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi, L.C. 1996, c. 23 (Loi).\n[2] La norme de contr\u00f4le qui s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est celle de la d\u00e9cision raisonnable (Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c.

L\u2019appelante s\u2019oppose au classement tarifaire effectu\u00e9 par le Tribunal relativement \u00e0 une cargaison de hauts de cuisse de poulet qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant de la \u00ab poule de r\u00e9forme \u00bb (No tarifaire 0207.14.10) au moment de son importation. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal, confirmant la d\u00e9cision du pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, a conclu, sur la balance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la cargaison correspondait plut\u00f4t au classement de \u00ab jeune poulet \u00bb (No tarifaire 0207.14.93), un classement attirant un traitement tarifaire plus \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n[2] Il est de jurisprudence constante qu\u2019en vertu du paragraphe 68(1) de la Loi sur les douanes, L.R.C. 1985, c. 1 (2e suppl.), un appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal doit se limiter aux questions de droit (Canada (Attorney General) v.

Cette d\u00e9cision porte sur la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 162(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C. 1985, c. 1 (5e suppl.) (la Loi) laquelle s\u2019applique lorsqu\u2019un contribuable produit tardivement une d\u00e9claration de revenus. Cette p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 est calcul\u00e9e en fonction de l\u2019imp\u00f4t impay\u00e9 \u00e0 la date fix\u00e9e dans la Loi pour la production de la d\u00e9claration.\n[2] L\u2019appelant ne conteste pas avoir produit tardivement sa d\u00e9claration de revenus pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2014. Plut\u00f4t, il s\u2019est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t parce qu\u2019il consid\u00e8re que la ministre du Revenu national a incorrectement calcul\u00e9 la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant de ce retard. Selon l\u2019appelant, si la ministre avait tenu compte des cr\u00e9dits disponibles \u00e0 son compte et des trois ch\u00e8ques qu\u2019il avait transmis \u00e0 l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada, la ministre aurait conclu que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait aucun imp\u00f4t impay\u00e9 \u00e0 la date de production de sa d\u00e9claration pour 2014 et, qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, le montant de la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 est nul.\n[3] La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel. Faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la preuve devant elle, la Cour a conclu que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a donn\u00e9 aucune indication \u00e0 l\u2019Agence pr\u00e9cisant comment allouer le montant des ch\u00e8ques au solde d\u2019imp\u00f4t dont l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait redevable pour 2014. Au surplus, la Cour a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas juridiction de refaire ex post facto les allocations de paiements et de cr\u00e9dits au compte de l\u2019appelant.\n[4] Devant notre Cour, l\u2019appelant fait valoir deux arguments principaux. Premi\u00e8rement, il soutient que la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a err\u00e9 en ent\u00e9rinant le montant de la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 calcul\u00e9 par la ministre. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de cet argument, l\u2019appelant fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux ch\u00e8ques et paiements sur lesquels s\u2019est pench\u00e9e la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019appelant soutient que la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale en ne respectant pas son choix d\u2019avoir un proc\u00e8s compl\u00e9tement en fran\u00e7ais et en ne lui permettant pas de contre-interroger la d\u00e9posante d\u2019une d\u00e9claration sous serment produite par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[5] Nous ne pouvons accepter ces arguments.\n[6] En ce qui a trait au calcul de la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9, un d\u00e9biteur effectuant un paiement \u00e0 son cr\u00e9ancier peut allouer ce paiement \u00e0 la dette de son choix, et le cr\u00e9diteur doit respecter ce choix. Toutefois, lorsque le d\u00e9biteur effectue ce paiement sans pr\u00e9ciser une allocation particuli\u00e8re, le cr\u00e9ancier a la discr\u00e9tion d\u2019allouer le paiement \u00e0 sa guise : Andrew Paving & Engineering Ltd v. Minister of National Revenue, 84 DTC 1157 \u00e0 1159, citant Agricultural Insurance Co. v. Sargeant, (1896), 26 SCR 29 \u00e0 36; La Ronge Lumber & Electric Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, 85 DTC 573, aux paras. 10\u201311.\n[7] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a conclu \u00e0 l\u2019absence d\u2019instructions de la part de l\u2019appelant concernant l\u2019allocation de ses ch\u00e8ques. La Cour a de plus not\u00e9 qu\u2019il arrivait \u00e0 l\u2019appelant d\u2019envoyer des informations confuses \u00e0 l\u2019Agence, tels le num\u00e9ro d\u2019assurance sociale de sa conjointe ou son num\u00e9ro de taxe de vente, ce qui pouvait induire l\u2019Agence \u00e0 allouer un paiement \u00e0 un compte autre que le compte d\u2019imp\u00f4t de l\u2019appelant. Ne d\u00e9celant aucune erreur manifeste et d\u00e9terminante de la part de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur cette \u00e9valuation de la preuve, une norme d\u2019intervention exigeante, notre Cour ne peut intervenir.\n[8] Au surplus, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve devant elle, nous sommes d\u2019avis que la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e de conclure qu\u2019elle ne pouvait se substituer \u00e0 l\u2019Agence et allouer les paiements et cr\u00e9dits au compte d\u2019imp\u00f4t de l\u2019appelant. Dans la m\u00eame veine, nous ne pouvons acquiescer \u00e0 l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelant selon lequel la nouvelle cotisation pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2013 aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9tablie avant la nouvelle cotisation pour 2014. Non seulement cet argument n\u2019a-t-il pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, mais nous ne disposons d\u2019aucune information qui nous permettrait de nous prononcer sur ce point. Lors de l\u2019audience, l\u2019appelant a soulev\u00e9 un certain nombre d\u2019arguments qui ne se retrouvent pas dans son m\u00e9moire et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels il n\u2019a pu nous r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au dossier d\u2019appel. Encore une fois, et tel que nous le lui avons expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, nous ne pouvons consid\u00e9rer ces arguments.\n[9] Au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, la transcription de l\u2019audition r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le proc\u00e8s a eu lieu en fran\u00e7ais et que les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 des d\u00e9cisions disponibles seulement en anglais ont \u00e9t\u00e9 traduites par l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Pour ce qui est du contre-interrogatoire de la d\u00e9posante d\u2019une d\u00e9claration sous serment produite par l\u2019intim\u00e9, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que cette d\u00e9claration a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e des mois avant l\u2019audience. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019\u00e0 la veille de l\u2019audience que l\u2019appelant a communiqu\u00e9 son intention de contre-interroger la d\u00e9posante. Or, si l\u2019appelant d\u00e9sirait contre-interroger la d\u00e9posante, il aurait d\u00fb lui signifier un subpoena exigeant sa pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 l\u2019audience (article 19 des R\u00e8gles de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (proc\u00e9dure informelle), DORS\/90-688b) ou, \u00e0 tout le moins, en avertir l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en temps opportun. Dans ce contexte, nous ne pouvons conclure \u00e0 un manquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[10] Pour toutes ces raisons, l\u2019appel sera rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\n\u00ab Nathalie Goyette \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\nA-147-23\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nJULES CHARTIER c.

(QMI). Ces requ\u00eates, au nombre de trois et produites sous forme de lettre dat\u00e9e du 11 mars 2024, sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le contexte d\u2019une demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel log\u00e9e par la requ\u00e9rante, Rogers Communications Canada Inc. (Rogers), aux termes du paragraphe 64(1) de la Loi sur les t\u00e9l\u00e9communications, L.C. 1993, c. 38. Cette demande vise une d\u00e9cision d\u2019arbitrage d\u2019offres finales prise par le Conseil de la radiodiffusion et des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications canadiennes (le Conseil) en date du 24 juillet 2023, d\u00e9cision suivant laquelle le Conseil a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019offre de QMI \u00e0 celle de Rogers aux fins de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des tarifs d\u2019acc\u00e8s de gros pour les exploitants de r\u00e9seaux mobiles virtuels entre QMI et Rogers (la D\u00e9cision).\n[2] Les pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates ont principalement pour point de d\u00e9part une demande de transmission de documents adress\u00e9e par QMI au Conseil le 22 janvier 2024 en vertu des R\u00e8gles 317 et 350 des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, D.O.R.S.\/98-106 (les R\u00e8gles), laquelle demande \u00e9mane \u00e0 son tour d\u2019une Ordonnance prononc\u00e9e par cette Cour le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2023. Aux termes de cette Ordonnance (l\u2019Ordonnance de divulgation), la Cour ordonnait au Conseil de divulguer \u00e0 Rogers les affirmations, analyses et le plan d\u2019affaires d\u00e9pos\u00e9s sous pli confidentiel par QMI dans le cadre de la Proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage finale opposant les deux parties. Sur r\u00e9ception de ces documents, Rogers a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour permission d\u2019amender sa demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel (la Requ\u00eate pour permission d\u2019amender), laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e aux termes d\u2019une ordonnance portant la m\u00eame date que la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance.\n[3] Les pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates d\u00e9coulent aussi d\u2019une Ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e par cette Cour, \u00e0 la demande de Rogers, \u00e0 la m\u00eame date que l\u2019Ordonnance de divulgation, soit le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2023 (l\u2019Ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9).\n[4] Ces requ\u00eates visent \u00e0 obtenir ce qui suit :\na) La transmission, par le Conseil, \u00e0 QMI, sur une base \u00ab avocats externes et experts seulement \u00bb de certaines informations d\u00e9sign\u00e9es confidentielles par Rogers dans le cadre de la Proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage devant le Conseil;\nb)La reformulation de l\u2019Ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 afin d\u2019y ajouter un troisi\u00e8me niveau de confidentialit\u00e9 et de donner acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un repr\u00e9sentant d\u00e9sign\u00e9 de QMI aux informations confidentielles de Rogers advenant que la Cour en ordonne la transmission aux termes de la premi\u00e8re requ\u00eate; et\nc)La modification de l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier proc\u00e9dural \u00e9tabli par cette Cour le 7 septembre 2023 quant \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 QMI devra produire et signifier son dossier de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel amend\u00e9e de Rogers suivant la survenance de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de quatre sc\u00e9narios li\u00e9s au succ\u00e8s ou au rejet des deux premi\u00e8res requ\u00eates.\nI. La transmission des informations confidentielles de Rogers\n[5] QMI soutient que sans ces informations, que le Conseil refuse de lui transmettre sans une ordonnance de la Cour l\u2019obligeant \u00e0 le faire, elle ne sera pas en mesure de r\u00e9pondre ad\u00e9quatement \u00e0 la demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel amend\u00e9e de Rogers alors que cette derni\u00e8re pourra invoquer les siennes aux fins de ladite demande, comme le lui permet l\u2019Ordonnance de divulgation. Notamment, il ne lui sera pas possible, dit-elle, de r\u00e9pondre ad\u00e9quatement au moyen d\u2019appel invoqu\u00e9 par Rogers suivant lequel cette derni\u00e8re aurait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une r\u00e9ponse diff\u00e9rente \u00e0 l\u2019offre finale de QMI si le Conseil ne lui avait pas refus\u00e9 l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux informations confidentielles de QMI. Cela ne peut se faire, soutient-elle, que si elle a elle-m\u00eame acc\u00e8s aux informations confidentielles de Rogers.\n[6] Rogers soutient, pour sa part, qu\u2019au mieux, QMI a droit \u00e0 ce que lui soit divulgu\u00e9 la preuve et les repr\u00e9sentions \u00e9crites confidentielles produites par Rogers en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019offre finale de QMI, et non l\u2019ensemble de la preuve et des repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites confidentielles qu\u2019elle a produites dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage, comme QMI le r\u00e9clame. Elle soutient de plus que cette demande de QMI est tardive et contredit les positions ant\u00e9rieures prises par QMI quant \u00e0 la pertinence, aux fins de la demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel, de l\u2019information confidentielle produite par les parties dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage.\n[7] Selon les positions qu\u2019elles occupent dans tout ce d\u00e9bat entourant la transmission des documents qui \u00e9taient devant le Conseil, les parties n\u2019offrent pas la m\u00eame perceptive de la R\u00e8gle 317 et de son application. Tant\u00f4t l\u2019on fait valoir le principe que la R\u00e8gle 317 consacre, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il autorise \u00e0 une partie \u00e0 demander \u00ab la transmission des documents ou des \u00e9l\u00e9ments mat\u00e9riels pertinents quant \u00e0 la demande, qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas, mais qui sont en la possession de l\u2019office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral dont l\u2019ordonnance fait l\u2019objet de la demande \u00bb (Compagnie des chemins de fers nationaux du Canada c. Canada (Office des transports), 2019 CAF 257 au para. 12). Tant\u00f4t l\u2019on fait valoir que la R\u00e8gle 317 ne s\u2019applique pas aux demandes d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel ou de contr\u00f4le judiciaire puisque, \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape pr\u00e9alable du processus, l\u2019appel \u2013 ou le contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u2013 n\u2019est pas encore form\u00e9 (Lukas c. Swoop Inc., 2019 CAF 145).\n[8] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, j\u2019estime que l\u2019Ordonnance de divulgation est venue changer la donne en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce en reconnaissant \u00e0 la fois la pertinence et divulgabilit\u00e9 des renseignements confidentiels de QMI dont Rogers souhaitait obtenir la communication. Dans ce contexte bien particulier, il est difficile de refuser \u00e0 QMI ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Rogers dans la mesure o\u00f9 QMI recherche la transmission de renseignements de m\u00eame nature. Si elles sont pour se battre \u00e0 armes \u00e9gales aux fins de la demande sous-jacente en autorisation d\u2019appel de la D\u00e9cision, et ce m\u00eame si le fardeau que Rogers doit rencontrer n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9, QMI doit donc pouvoir compter, par le biais de ses conseillers externes, sur le m\u00eame type d\u2019information que celle dont la communication \u00e0 Rogers a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e par cette Cour. C\u2019est de cette seule mani\u00e8re, \u00e0 mon sens, que QMI sera en mesure de r\u00e9pondre ad\u00e9quatement, toujours dans les limites du test applicable au traitement des demandes d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel, \u00e0 l\u2019argument voulant que Rogers, dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019offre finale de QMI, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mieux en mesure de convaincre le Conseil, si elle avait eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information confidentielle de QMI, que son offre finale \u00e9tait sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle de cette derni\u00e8re.\n[9] Ceci dit, QMI a-t-elle droit \u00e0 la communication de toutes les repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites, analyses et rapports d\u2019experts soumis par Rogers au Conseil, comme elle le r\u00e9clame, ou aux seuls renseignements confidentiels contenus \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de Rogers \u00e0 l\u2019offre finale de QMI, comme le pr\u00e9tend Rogers? \u00c0 mon sens, la demande de QMI parait ratisser trop large et l\u2019offre de Rogers, pas assez puisque, selon elle, sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019offre finale de QMI \u00ab was significantly limited \u00bb.\n[10] Ce qui m\u2019apparait le plus susceptible d\u2019assurer une certaine \u00e9quit\u00e9 dans le processus d\u2019examen de la demande sous-jacente d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel, dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, c\u2019est que QMI puisse avoir en mains, en plus de l\u2019information confidentielle dont Rogers ne s\u2019objecte pas \u00e0 la transmission, des renseignements du m\u00eame type que ceux obtenus par Rogers aux termes de l\u2019Ordonnance de divulgation, \u00e0 savoir les affirmations, l\u2019analyse et, si applicable, le plan d\u2019affaires d\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019offre finale de cette derni\u00e8re.\n[11] Une ordonnance en ce sens sera donc \u00e9mise, \u00e9tant entendu, bien \u00e9videmment, que la confidentialit\u00e9 de ces renseignements dont la transmission sera ordonn\u00e9e, sera, pour les fins de ladite demande d\u2019autorisation, assur\u00e9e par une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9.\nII. Modifications \u00e0 l\u2019Ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9\n[12] Tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, QMI demande aussi que soit reformul\u00e9e l\u2019Ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 afin d\u2019y ajouter un troisi\u00e8me niveau de confidentialit\u00e9, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 reproduire le modus operandi convenu entre les parties dans le cadre de la Proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage. Cette demande est \u00e0 l\u2019avantage des deux parties. Rogers, d\u2019ailleurs, ne s\u2019y oppose pas. Il y a lieu, selon moi, d\u2019y faire droit.\n[13] QMI demande aussi, et cette question est plus d\u00e9licate, \u00e0 ce que l\u2019Ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 soit modifi\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un de ses repr\u00e9sentants, qui serait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 d\u2019un commun accord par les parties ou, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut, par la Cour, soit autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir acc\u00e8s aux informations confidentielles de Rogers advenant que la Cour en ordonne la communication. QMI pr\u00e9tend que cet ajout \u00e0 l\u2019Ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 est n\u00e9cessaire puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas retenu les services d\u2019un expert dans le cadre de la Proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage devant le Conseil et que sans, \u00e0 tout le moins, l\u2019appui de l\u2019expertise de ses ressources internes, elle ne pourra r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la preuve d\u2019expert de Rogers.\n[14] Contrairement \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re demande de modification de l\u2019Ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9, Rogers s\u2019oppose farouchement \u00e0 celle-ci. Elle plaide que QMI sait depuis les tous d\u00e9buts de la Proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage qu\u2019elle a engag\u00e9 les services d\u2019un expert alors que QMI a fait le choix contraire. Elle pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que les mesures strictes de protection de l\u2019information confidentielle contenues \u00e0 l\u2019Ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9, lesquelles limitent la circulation de cette information aux avocats et experts externes des deux parties, excluant par le fait m\u00eame toute id\u00e9e que ladite information puisse \u00eatre partag\u00e9e avec des repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties, sont le fruit d\u2019une demande commune. Elle rappelle qu\u2019il en est ainsi en raison du milieu hautement comp\u00e9titif dans lequel les parties \u0153uvrent, milieu o\u00f9 la concurrence entre comp\u00e9titeurs est f\u00e9roce. Enfin, Rogers souligne que si QMI souhaite vraiment obtenir l\u2019apport d\u2019un expert pour pr\u00e9parer sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel amend\u00e9e, elle n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 engager un expert externe.\n[15] \u00c0 mon avis, le statu quo \u00e9tabli par l\u2019Ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 ceux et celles pouvant avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information confidentielle doit \u00eatre maintenu et le fait que Rogers amende sa demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel ne doit pas devenir le pr\u00e9texte pour avantager, sur ce plan, une partie par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Ceci dit, rien n\u2019emp\u00eache QMI de retenir les services d\u2019un expert externe, si ses avocats externes veulent ce type d\u2019appui dans la pr\u00e9paration de la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ladite demande.\n[16] L\u2019Ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 sera donc modifi\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux pr\u00e9sents motifs.\nIII. Modifications \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier proc\u00e9dural\n[17] Il n\u2019y a pas de d\u00e9saccord entre les parties au sujet de cette demande et celle-ci va de soi compte tenu que la date de computation du d\u00e9lai de 20 jours fix\u00e9 par Directive de cette Cour le 7 septembre 2023 pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la r\u00e9ponse de QMI \u00e0 la demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel de la D\u00e9cision, doit \u00eatre r\u00e9ajust\u00e9e en raison des requ\u00eates dont la Cour est pr\u00e9sentement saisie et du fait que Rogers a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 amender cette demande.\n[18] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des diff\u00e9rents sc\u00e9narios \u00e9voqu\u00e9s par QMI aux fins de la d\u00e9termination de la date de computation dudit d\u00e9lai de 20 jours, la r\u00e9ponse de QMI \u00e0 la demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel amend\u00e9e devra \u00eatre signifi\u00e9e et d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans les 20 jours de la date \u00e0 laquelle les informations confidentielles de Rogers, dont la divulgation sera ordonn\u00e9e dans la mesure pr\u00e9vue aux pr\u00e9sents motifs, sont transmises aux avocats externes de QMI par le Conseil.\n[19] Rogers demande \u00e0 ce que cette \u00e9ch\u00e9ance soit p\u00e9remptoire. En toutes autres circonstances, cette demande serait justifi\u00e9e, compte tenu qu\u2019une demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel est une proc\u00e9dure sommaire et que les d\u00e9lais encourus jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant dans ce dossier, lesquels, il faut toutefois le pr\u00e9ciser, ne sont pas attribuables uniquement \u00e0 QMI, sont importants. Mon h\u00e9sitation vient du fait que QMI pourrait toujours s\u2019adjoindre les services d\u2019un expert externe. Une certaine souplesse est donc de mise consid\u00e9rant les al\u00e9as possibles li\u00e9s \u00e0 une telle d\u00e9marche, qui, il est \u00e0 souhaiter, est d\u00e9j\u00e0 entam\u00e9e.\n[20] Je pr\u00e9cise toutefois qu\u2019advenant que QMI dise ne pas \u00eatre en mesure de rencontrer cette nouvelle \u00e9ch\u00e9ance, elle devra en demander la prorogation par requ\u00eate et d\u00e9montrer, pour r\u00e9ussir, preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui, qu\u2019elle a fait preuve de toute la diligence requise \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de toutes les circonstances et que malgr\u00e9 ses meilleurs efforts, il ne lui est pas possible de rencontrer ladite \u00e9ch\u00e9ance.\n[21] Une directive en ce sens, modifiant celle du 7 septembre 2023, sera \u00e9mise.\n\u00ab Ren\u00e9 LeBlanc \u00bb\nj.c.a.\nCOUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER :\n23-A-44\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nROGERS COMMUNICATIONS CANADA INC. c.
